## Basic Model for Predicting Nutrient Density of Food Consumption
### __Background__ 
Adequate nutritional status is crucial for human growth and survival. Nutritional status can be assessed by evaluating individual-specific nutritional requirements and intake. An imbalance between nutritional needs and intake may lead to either deficiency or excess, both of which negatively impact health. This condition is commonly referred to as malnutrition (Bouma, 2017; Rinninella et al., 2017). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), malnutrition can occur due to an imbalance in nutrient intake, which may affect health status, disrupt food digestion, or impair nutrient absorption (Khan et al., 2022). Malnutrition is not limited to undernutrition; it also encompasses a broader scope including macronutrient and micronutrient imbalances, obesity, cachexia, sarcopenia, and malnourishment (Cederholm et al., 2019).

In Indonesia, malnutrition—including both undernutrition and obesity—remains a serious issue. The 2018 Global Nutrition Report revealed that one in five child deaths globally is associated with poor dietary intake. Based on data from Indonesia's 2018 Basic Health Research, malnutrition cases include 30.8% of stunting, 3.5% of severe malnutrition, and other related conditions such as obesity (Zianka et al., 2024). Nutritional issues in children, if left unaddressed, may continue into adolescence and adulthood (Simbolon, 2013). Such conditions have far-reaching negative implications, as children with inadequate nutritional intake may experience delayed brain development and lower intelligence. Ultimately, this may hinder national economic growth and even increase poverty. The potential economic losses due to malnutrition are significant and may create a financial burden for the healthcare system in the future (Kemenkes RI, 2018).

Obesity, on the other hand, affects over a quarter of the adult population in Indonesia. The high prevalence of obesity among adults indicates poor dietary patterns. Consuming high-calorie, high-fat, and high-sugar foods without sufficient physical activity is a major factor contributing to obesity (Yamantri et al., 2024).

One approach to addressing malnutrition is by providing widespread education on the importance of balanced nutrition, particularly for children. This can be achieved quickly and cost-effectively by leveraging digital technology for information distribution. Additionally, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), such as intelligent agent assistants, can help users access information quickly and accurately. For this reason, the authors have developed a machine learning model to predict the nutrition density of commonly consumed foods and beverages. Nutrition density is a metric that reflects the amount of nutrients provided per unit of energy or calories. This concept is designed to evaluate the nutritional quality of a food item based on its nutrient content relative to its caloric value, thereby helping individuals choose nutrient-dense foods without excess energy or unnecessary calories (EUFIC, 2021). The model aims to be applied to a nutritional balance information service that enables users to make informed food choices suited to their individual needs and conditions.

The machine learning model will be developed using Google’s TensorFlow framework, chosen for its flexibility and scalability, allowing the authors to build machine learning applications from small to large scales. The model will employ a Neural Network algorithm, selected for its capability to handle complex data and hidden layers that facilitate automatic feature extraction, thus recognizing correlations among nutritional attributes without requiring extensive manual data processing (RevoU, 2024; Cakrawala, 2024). This enables the model to deliver accurate predictions of nutrition density based on available nutritional data for various food items.
