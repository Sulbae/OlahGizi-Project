this dish can easily be halved if you don't need such a large amount (or doubled if you need more).  this is a nice recipe to pour into individual serving dishes (custard cups or ramekins work well) while still warm. sprinkle with a little extra cinnamon to garnish, cool, and eat cold or at room temperature.","['long-grain white rice', 'water', 'cinnamon stick', 'milk', 'vanilla', 'sugar']",6

the wonder of this recipe is it's simplicity and healthiness without compromising deep, satisfying flavour. almost every other celery soup i've read requires both flour for thickening and vast amounts of milk or other dairy products. this soup only requires 1/2 a cup of half and half and could be easily substituted with soy milk. when i made this soup the first time, i ate 3 bowls of it; it was that good! i've since made it each time that celery goes on sale and even toyed with the idea of buying it at full price just to enjoy it's rich but healthful flavour. although it requires a shallot, i've never used one and it turns out perfect each time. eventually, i may try it that way but as it stands, it's a 5 star cream of celery soup that fills me up on cold winter nights.","['unsalted butter', 'shallot', 'scallions', 'celery', 'chicken broth', 'potato', 'fresh rosemary', 'nutmeg', 'half-and-half cream']",9

this red chili is a bit of a departure in that i use beans in it. beans can complement a chili nicely but should be chosen carefully. flavor and texture should not be overwhelming and should go well with the chilis and meat. this chili was made with red or pink beans:  a form of thin-skinned, small kidney bean similar in appearance to a pinto. these were chosen because, when they cook for a long time, they not only add a nice flavor to the chili but they take on the flavor of the chili itself in a smooth, almost butter-like consistency. this allows the flavor of the chili to be spread smoothly around the mouth while eating.

in terms of heat, i rate this chili at 3-½ out of 5. i like things hot so this is just a hair above “medium” by my way of thinking.

i also won 2nd place in the 2012 company chili cook-off with this one:  whoot!

prep time does not include firing up the smoker. 4 hours smoking time is an estimate. time will vary according to your smoker and how meaty and large your peppers are. it also takes longer for green, grassy flavored peppers than it does for fully ripe ones. 1/4 cup chips is just to start the process, you will need up to 2 pounds, possibly more.","['jalapenos', 'wood chips']",2
