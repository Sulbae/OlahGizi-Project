167527,380365,2009-09-14,5,I was born and raised in AL...this is a favorite.  I have to have these everytime I go home to visit family and recently found a site where I can order raw peanuts since they are hard to find in CO.  I just love them.  Thanks for posting!
184723,34335,2008-01-15,5,"If I could give this more stars, I would.  We love pork tenderloin and the couple of recipes that I do use involve browning in a pan first... just because it's prettier that way and the texture is so good I've leaned toward those.  Now this recipe, without even marinating or browning or anything was SO SO GOOD!!!!  It was so much easier yet so flavorful and took so much less time.  Thanks so much, this is a dish I will make for company for sure... the seasoning was so good my husband was wishing there was more to go with his rice.  Thanks!"
2001108724,491150,2018-02-16,5,"I made these last night and they were delish! They're light,fluffy, very filling and a snap to stir up! I didn't add anything as they were an accompaniment to a Ham, Potato, Corn soup that I was serving."
135804,50367,2004-04-01,4,Wonderful flavor.  Roasting really brings out the flavor.  I used whole milk instead of cream and added just a smidge of white wine with the stock.    
1048246,388076,2010-01-04,5,"I wanted to try something different for the holidays and decided on this recipe.  Am I ever glad I chose this one!  It was so tender and moist, and not at all strong flavored like some lamb I have had.  We loved this so much and I will be making this again!"
128950,82666,2005-09-12,5,"I rarely stray from my own lasagne recipe, but I was intrigued by the fresh mozzarella and the pasta soaked in the hot water.  I loved the fresh mozzarella, but would fully cook the noodles the next time, as they were a bit starchy for my taste."
869153,477779,2012-06-21,0,"Thank you, thank you for putting instructions for those of us who do not own a food processor!!!!<br/>Love the dressing!<br/><br/>t"
134124,293316,2008-09-08,5,"Made for Recipe swap 20 group 10, really enjoyed this recipe, it was pretty fast to make and the flavor was great !! I will definately make this again. Thanks"
593927,329224,2009-05-04,4,"I made this with 1 acorn squash and I had to turn the oven down midway though as the tops started to become too burn. I suggest 350F until done. I used regular sea salt, a small sprinkle of powdered ginger on each half which was nice and 2 tbs of maple syrup for each side. I did not use pecans because it would not match what I was serving it with but I'm sure they would be good on this. May make again."
2000991193,217803,2017-04-05,5,"I have made these muffins 2 years in a row and they are always a huge hit. I left out the cream of tartar this time and didn't notice a difference. Personally I prefer a little less sweet, but my kids love them just the way they are. Next year I think I'll do one batch with half the sugar for me :-)"
307995,123111,2006-04-18,5,Thank you! I've been looking for a recipe for candied ginger forever! This recipe is excellent.
129652,112478,2008-04-04,4,"I made these into muffins.  The texture was good.  I would have liked for this to be a bit sweeter.  I did add 2 Tbsp. ground flax seed, used dairy milk, and left out the walnuts."
230617,62936,2005-07-22,5,"In my Eastern European history class this past semester we had an Eastern European cooking day.  I made some Å opsky for the class.  Everyone who tried it loved it and it really did not last very long at all.  I added the vinegar and sugar dressing to it and I think it was a nice touch.  My teacher asked me where I found the recipe and I told her.  She is from Bulgaria.  She lived there most of her life and is now teaching here in Oklahoma.  She told me that this salad comes from a region in Southern Bulgaria (so in Bulgarian the name would like this: &#1064;&#1086;&#1087;&#1089;&#1082;&#1080;).  That would explain why it has such a greek feel to it, because Bulgaria's southern border is with Greece and Macedonia.  She also told me that next time I should get Bulgarian Feta cheese.  She said that it does not have the strong smell like normal feta cheese.  A little place in there in Norman imports the cheese, so I do not think it would be to hard to find some wherever you may be.  Thanks for putting the recipe up here.  Like I said, everyone loved it."
2179545,473421,2012-02-11,5,Absolutly amazing!  Follow the recipe exactly its just great <3
9869,34853,2004-12-03,4,"One of my favourite vegetables and I wanted to try this because it was just a little different for us..enjoyed the flavours, thanks for sharing."
37636,286015,2009-01-08,5,"My daughter gave this a big 5-star thumbs up, having enjoyed this being on liquids after a tooth extraction. Thanks for sharing! ~Sue"
840768,166834,2008-11-28,5,"Tryed this and really liked it.  However, I made 2 small changes... substituted deli mustard for the chipotle and yogurt for the heavy cream.  I like my sauces alittle thicker so added 1 tsp cornstarch (mixed with 1 Tbsp cold water) in the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Chops were very tender, juicy & full of flavor."
194888,27208,2005-06-13,5,"Wow, this was to die for! My husband and I loved this recipe. I used a 3 pound pot roast, and cooked it on low for 8 hours, and it was falling apart as I took it out of the crockpot. Wonderful!"
201064,126611,2007-11-23,3,"I was looking forward to making this recipe, but was slightly disappointed.  It was a very heavy salad which I couldn't have more than two bites of.  The flavour though was nice, and I might try to lighten the salad a bit.  It would have been a 5 star salad had it not been this heavy for us.  If you have any ideas on how I could do that, please let me know.  If and when I make this salad again I will definitely update my review. I appologize about the mediocre review wildflour."
145547,43812,2004-06-11,0,"think i baked too long, werent as chewy as i expected... next time i'll keep a closer eye. were definitely delicious though!!"
176615,76495,2004-12-12,5,"Very easy and so beautiful, they would be really special for a holiday brunch. I used homemade blueberry jam in one half, Christmas jam in the other. The kids liked them, and I will try adding peanut butter with the jelly next time for my son who eats nothing but. Thanks, Chris from Kansas, for a great recipe!"
632657,374133,2009-06-29,4,"Mmmmmmmm!!! I LOVE the flavors of coconut and lime together - the curry puts it right over the top. I lightly coated shrimp with flour, fried in some oil, the poured the sauce over it (the shrimp soaked up more of this wonderful sauce), and served it over rice noodles.  Sooooo delicious! I can't wait to try it with chicken and fish. I made this for the ""Hot, Spicy & Tasty Food"" event - June 2009."
383346,494105,2013-04-09,5,These pancakes have a wonderful taste.  The texture was perfect.  They&#039;re moist and were great with maple syrup.  Thanks Roberts :)  Made for PAC Spring 2013
113509,386397,2012-01-07,4,"We had these for dinner tonight and really enjoyed them. Hubby did all the cooking because the grill is his domain. We didn't let the meat marinate, as I did not read that part of the directions until he had mixed them up and was outside grilling them. Oh well, there is always next time, which there definitely will be, because we enjoyed them so much. I might add some fresh dill next time, but even without that, they are a great meal. Thanks for posting the recipe."
107583,320452,2009-04-04,5,"We loved this for a light supper while out in the RV.  Great flavors!  I used Classico bottled pesto and sharp cheddar, but will try it with feta next time.  Caramelizing onions really made for a richer flavor than just sauteing them."
179133,31811,2011-01-04,5,"This is a very good enchilada sauce. I made as directed except for two things - I was short on tomato sauce by 2 ounces so I made up for it with 2 extra ounces of salsa. I also cut the water to one cup after reading other reviews that it was thin, and thought it was just right. I'm looking forward to using this on some spinach enchiladas and over frijoles refritos. Thanks for sharing!"
327600,39087,2006-07-17,5,I'm pretty sure everyone's already said all there is to say!  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!
1801014030,257701,2013-12-19,5,"What a great and easy recipe!! Simply love it! &lt;br/&gt;I&#039;m a beginner cook, and I really liked how easy it was to make! Thumbs up!"
193516,259881,2008-03-04,5,"These are really great pancakes! I found the prominent taste to be the banana, but that was welcomed, and provided some sweetness to the pancakes. I was expecting the pancakes to be a little on the drier side, but they were still nice and moist and fluffy. A great and tasty way to use these different flours."
229800,113014,2005-07-18,5,Outstanding Chicken. This is the only way I ever want a whole chicken ever again!
331557,61230,2009-05-04,5,"This really was quick, easy and tasty.  I cooked as written with the exception of using only 1/2 of a jalapeno in place of the whole and skipped the salt because we never add salt to main courses.  I served this with rice and curried cauliflower and it was an awesome meal that I will definitely make again.  Thanks for posting!"
55827,38824,2002-09-23,5,This recipe was easy & delicious.  The whole family loved it.  I made it for sunday football.  No leftovers!!
55862,49153,2003-10-24,5,"Wow!  This made a LOT more than I was expecting, but it's SOOOOO good.  EXTREMELY rich, so definitely slice those babies THIN.  Also, this is a very messy treat, so have lots of napkins handy.  The chocolate is very melty.  I made this with white marshmallows for Halloween and it looked very creepy in my gift basket along with big shards of peanut brittle and gummy worms sticking out strategically.  :D"
797486,236725,2008-05-11,5,"WOW! This was an amazing recipe. I am certainly not an experienced cook, and these turned out beautifully! They rolled quite nicely over fruit, jam and sugar and kept their shape even after my not-so-gentle folding. I made them for Mother's Day breakfast in bed - and will probably be making them every weekend! Thanks again for a great recipe."
233829,57062,2006-09-10,4,"I really wasn't expecting this to work out, but it did.  I followed the recipe, but stirred in some extra cheese into the potato mixture.  I also used Smart Balance instead of butter.  It worked fine.  Froze well.  Will definitely be making a bigger batch next time.  I love having pre-made meals/side dishes in the freezer.  It is so helpful.  Thanks for the recipe.  "
47559,211523,2007-03-17,5,Outstanding.  More than 5 stars.  Better than hot chocolate.  Loved this discovery.
90987,94055,2005-01-05,3,Very easy to prepare. I don't have a grill so I just tossed the scallops and peppers in a non-stick frying pan.  I was a little disappointed as there was no discernable taste of orange in the scallops - I think I might cut the amount of soy sauce in half next time as it was quite salty.  The toasted almonds and the peppers were a nice crunchy contrast to the tender scallops.
2000381616,32204,2015-11-19,5,"Very good. I doubled the recipe and added pecans, baked @350 in a 13x9 glass pan for 35 minutes and came out perfect."
83503,140051,2007-08-22,5,"Two thumbs up for this dish! It's excellent. The seasonings are perfectly balanced so that nothing overpowers.  Although the Ouzo is optional I think it has an impact on the flavour of the dish.  You can't identify it amongst the other seasonings and there's definitely no hint of ""licorice"". I followed the recipe as written with a few minor changes - used a 28 oz. can of whole tomatoes (drained) coarsely chopped, as well as 4 fresh plum tomatoes, seeded and chopped (didn't bother peeling them). Added 4 chopped green onions (white and light green parts only), and increased the fresh oregano to a heaping tablespoon. Layered the shrimp and sauce in one large casserole. This can be assembled ahead and heated at 400F for a few minutes till bubbly before browning the cheese under the broiler."
1839316,115153,2012-09-05,5,"Oh boy, takes cauliflower to a whole new level for me! This is a great diet snack, depending on the oil/amt used. I'm going to surprise my family by maybe using it as a garnish but I think they'll want more ;)"
89831,93573,2006-10-11,5,"YUMMMMM! this is delicious! I was going to use my own recipe for the pastry but decided to try this one, I only chilled it for about 1-1/2 hours and it was really quite easy to work with, I also added in a couple teaspoons of sugar to the pastry (just personal preference). I incresed the anchovies, capers and garlic quite a bit, and also topped the tart with Parmesan cheese before baking. thanks Ev!...Kitten:)"
1565704,117370,2011-01-17,4,"I baked the thick batter in a 9 inch square mirro alum pan at 350* for 35-40 min so this was a Blueberry Quick Bread instead of muffins. I usually end up with cakes being burnt when cooking at such high temps and decided to bake at 350* instead of 400*.  The end result was a light and unexpected biscuity texture which was nice.  Next time I will add another egg and more melted butter since I prefer more moistness.  I will use an 8 inch square pan next time, too.  Otherwise it was quite tasty and the sweetness was perfect.   Thanks much for your posting."
168922,53907,2006-01-21,5,"This one will surprise you. Not only was it fast to make, my PICKY family got seconds.  To save time since I didn't have grated carrots was to boil baby carrots w/the pasta and added beef bouillon, frozen peas instead of canned and the cooking time at the end was in microwave, which shortened time to the table and avoided me having to turn on the oven. Thanks for a uniquely different recipe.  "
605947,3470,2008-03-01,4,Great meal for very little effort.  We are renovating our kitchen so crockpot meals are perfect.  I served the meal with a side of honey-glazed carrots.  I think my family will ask for this...even after the new kitchen is in!
41481,17092,2002-05-21,4,"I first read the recipe, and then the suggestions before actually making the dish. I agreed with most that it needed a little extra seasoning. So when making the meatballs I added about 1tsp of minced garlic and 2-3tbs of parmesan and some oregano to taste. Then with the sauce added 1tsp+ Hungarian paprika, 1 can mushrooms, and the kicker was about half a package of mushroom gravy mix, this totally brought out the flavour. Also added parsley, parmesan, and salt to taste. Served on Egg Noodles tossed with garlic butter, parlsey and parmesan. This is a wonderful recipe with room for your imagination. My two year old loved the tender meatballs!!"
2100351,118285,2011-12-11,4,"We loved them, texture was great. Not as sweet and not as much honey flavor as we would have liked, but will definitely make them again!"
2000498330,514478,2016-06-30,2,"Bland, bland, bland. The ground beef needs at the very least salt and pepper. The herb topping did not give off much flavor. Only positive thing to say--the burgers were moist."
2000421588,33671,2015-08-28,5,"I wish I could give more than five stars! I just made it for our dinner tonight and everybody loves it! The meat was so tender, juicy and so flavorful! I cooked on high for 4 hours and the meat was pulled off easily. I think if I added about 2 more hours the meat would be more pull apart. After it&#039;s done, I broiled for about 5-7 minutes for browning the skin a little bit. I made the gravy from the juice which was so tasty. Overall, this recipe is so easy and delicious!"
936601,392711,2010-02-23,5,Oh my goodness!  These little gems are just delicious!  Made as directed without the banana peppers in DH's.  I added a little italian salad dressing in mine as well.  Thankyou gailanng!  I will be making these often!  Made for KK's Chef's Pick Tag
412186,3653,2007-08-04,5,Had this for tonight's dinner. Followed directions and made no changes. Will make again. Great recipe.
1336981,173701,2011-07-31,5,"Delish!! This is my favorite Salmon recipe.  I've used this recipe five or six times and it always turns out great. I do cut back on the mustard because I'm not a big fan, but it does such a terrific job of complimenting the cedar plank flavor! Thanks for posting!!"
1160862,123854,2010-05-03,0,"Oh my!!!...this is yummy & sooo fast & easy!  Well, I did as another reviewer suggested & instead of the red peppers, I used spinach, green beans, & rosemary (peppers bother me).  I make a full recipe, divide into portions, & freeze.  Excellent for those days I don't have time to cook.  Thank you justcallmetoni for sharing!"
51011,137370,2006-10-14,5,"This always reminds me of a snack my mom would make for me growing up.  I always blend mine w/ milk, and omit the vanilla (personal preference).  Every time I buy bananas I have to make this.  Thanks for sharing!"
531768,56891,2007-12-09,5,This is wonderful bread!
528197,132757,2010-11-08,5,"I made this last week and I'm making it again tonight! Loved it! Beautiful flavor, color and texture. When I made it last time, I sprinkled with some leftover toasted sliced almonds. Turned out to be a perfect compliment!"
35701,32277,2003-05-19,5,"Karen, these were great!  My kids couldn't wait to get their hands on them. They were very easy to prepare! I used grape kool aid and grape jello. Exciting, huh? :)   I didn't want to spring any funky flavor combos on my kids, they can be picky.  Anyway, they taste great, and I will be making these all summer!  Thanks for posting!"
164276,9327,2008-07-16,5,Thanks so much!!!  THis is a great recipe.  I have made it many times and the kids love it everytime!!  I replace oil with applesaucs to make it healthier.
226863,118373,2009-01-23,5,"I really enjoyed this!  My DS did too.  Served with mashed potatoes...can't imagine it with fries...I like my fries crisp, not covered in gravy.  The only thing I would change is to use less garlic (I can't believe I'm saying this...I love garlic!).  But the garlic flavor seemed to overwhelm everything else in the recipe.  As other reviewers have stated, it was a little too salty.  I'll maybe just use minced onions instead of the soup mix next time too.  I used fresh mushrooms...don't like the texture of canned ones.  It all came together very nicely and was great with mashed potatoes.  Made for Potluck tag!"
33135,15025,2002-09-23,4,"I was surprised at how tasty this was with such few ingredients, I made it for my husband but couldn't keep my fork out of it, very easy too."
37471,25568,2004-09-13,5,Excellent recipe!!  Made the full recipe...and even the leftovers tasted good! Thanks!
50509,51834,2007-01-24,2,"This really did not work for us. I measured out 8 oz of dry pasta by weight, and ended up with enough pasta to fill a 2 1/2 qt. baking dish - more like 6 to 8 servings. There really did not seem to be enough cheese - I guess I was expecting more of a sauce effect, and had instead pasta with some daubs of cheese. I liked all the individual ingredients, but as a dish this just did not appeal to us. Sorry."
865936,371960,2010-06-19,4,"This turned out very well.  Mine came out a little gloopy, but that is due to the fact that DH insisted I add ricotta cheese.  Also, I covered it in the oven, which turned out to be a bit of a mistake.  However, I let it sit a few minutes and everything was fine and delicious!  Made for ZWT 6."
1830040,117317,2013-11-15,0,I tried this recipe for my family and the cookies only lasted 2 days.  Now my daughter wants me to make it with white chocolate chips.  Here we go!!!
28397,403520,2014-11-24,4,This was ok. I feel like it was missing something but I can&#039;t really narrow it down. If I make it again I might try adding some chopped green onion to it. It was something different and really easy.
550518,240260,2007-08-01,2,"These weren't too bad, but definitely don't burn them.  It ruins them."
2656825,154740,2013-11-17,5,"Made it for the second time in a month due to my family requesting it again.  I did use ground sausage instead of turkey, and added more vegetables on top on the onion layer (mushrooms and celery).  The recipe does not specify, but make sure you cook the rice prior to putting it in the crockpot.  This will be in the regular rotation at my house, especially in the fall and winter!"
559290,162961,2008-07-27,5,"I made these last week and they were delicious. I halved the recipe because it was just my hubby and I and we had 6 small caps instead. I chopped and cooked the stems in some olive oil and italian bread crumbs and folded it into the mixture. Only had large tmatoes so topped each with one slice. We did 3 w/parm, 3 w/mozz and both preferred the mozz but the parm was still yummy. Served with couscous and a salad with a delicious strawberry vinaigrette I found on here (Recipe #89778) I left some comments/suggestions about that too. Hubby loved it all. Thanks for the recipe!"
345380,256670,2012-06-20,3,"Well I'm going to have to be a little bit of a Debbie Downer here.  I made the sauce exactly as stated (using the sour cream option) and to me it just seemed SOO sweet, and with the kind of odd aftertaste that Splenda has I found these quesadillas a little hard to get down :( I'm not even sure I would like it with regular sugar because pairing something that sweet with chicken just didn't wind up tasting good to me."
1449637,1236,2010-01-08,5,"""We really love it,"" says 6 yr. old Joel.  We wrapped the chicken breasts with the bacon, as some advised, and baked it in the oven not making the gravy, since our family isn't into gravy.  The paprika added nice color but not much flavor -- I'll probably add more next time.  And we dumped a LOT of shredded cheddar on top, as well as loading the insides of the chicken with more than the recommended amount of sharp cheddar.  Very tasty."
1802863776,248350,2014-06-27,5,"This recipe turned out really well. I made a couple of minor changes. But even without them, I think the flavour would have been delicious. The soup made this meal very creamy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I added in a medium sized onion, that I cooked alongside the red pepper in the butter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As well, I cooked the chicken separately first using a ?so juicy? bag and seasonings.  (I just found out about ?so juicy? ? but it is kind of like the ?shake and bake? -- Basically you oven bake the chicken in a plastic bag with some seasoning. (I chose the Rotisserie flavour) I think that ensured that the chicken already had good flavour before I added it to the red pepper and onions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I also threw in some baby carrots with the frozen peas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would definitely recommend this recipe. It was very easy to prepare. As the other reviewers said, it was very much like ?comfort food.?  Because I often have to cook for a family with big appetites, I was really pleased with the amount that it made. I was able to serve 6 people, two big bowls each and I just pared it with some fresh buns."
2798981,61044,2013-10-26,5,Yummmmm.
30911,15072,2002-02-15,5,"Outstanding!  Easy and almost ""shout"" homemade with love, according to my husband.  Thanks for sharing."
8629,198995,2008-11-18,4,These really worked out great as a prepare in advance appetizer. I used some sort of 3 cheese blend shredded cheese. I used a few shots of tabasco sauce. I used mini pretzel sticks as the 'toothpick'. I toasted the chopped walnuts in a dry skillet on the stovetop. That gave the walnuts a very pretty brown color I got many compliments on these when I brought them into work.
6357,87072,2004-03-21,5,"I made this using my own grated cabbage for a quick start to my lunch this afternoon. I used a few substitutions. I substituted the vinegar with fresh lemon juice and the sour cream with plain fat-free yogurt. As for the mayo, I used regular mustard instead which I simply ""love"".
Since I happened to have oregano at home, I used that instead of tarragon. I ""LOVE"" Sunflower seeds(which I have got hooked on to after coming to USA). This makes a delicious salad and I will make thi again, for sure!!  "
2308358,449590,2012-07-01,5,"I think we may have had more than 3lbs of wings, so the wings didn't get coated well enough with the sauce.  So make sure you make plenty of sauce, so that the wings are good & tangy.<br/>Also, we floured the wings, then fried them for 12 minutes.  Then we tossed them in the sauce, and then baked them at 500 degrees for a few minutes to help make them nice & crispy.  Great recipe, thank you for sharing!"
226066,256175,2007-11-26,5,Simple and tasty!!  Only thing I did different was to quarter my zucchini and cook them in the microwave.  Added lots of pepper.  Thanks lazyme - this is delicious! :)
37449,117317,2009-11-17,5,I enjoyed these cookies! I will be giving some of them as gifts. Thanks Roxy!
379033,188291,2008-04-08,5,"I seen the review for this during PAC and the picture is actually what grabbed my attention.  I made this for a quick lunch for DH and I, and it was wonderful.  I didn't have the beef bouillon powder, so I just omitted it, but I had all the other ingredients on hand.  It turned out great.  Thanks for a great recipe."
486078,321624,2009-10-20,5,This is fantastic!  Would not change a thing.  Thx. for posting.
567219,29413,2008-02-14,5,made these today for a romantic treat for my Valentine!  This is the best chocolate covered strawberry recipe I've tried because the chocolate coating stays so thick.  My usual recipe drips more chocolate on the wax paper then on the strawberry!  Thanks... this is our new Valentine's tradition!!
14823,85516,2004-06-29,5,An easy and refreshing salad for summer. I followed the recipe exactly and it worked really well.  Thanks.
101376,51830,2007-03-25,5,"WOW. This is a total surprise recipe!!!

I followed the recipe exactly making no changes.

I love a recipe you can just throw altogether and basically forget about!!

Delicious, the meat is soooo tender and tasty it just falls apart.
 
I'm a bit miffed at myself , I made this tonight (it's just now done at 10:30 pm) so I'd have it made ahead for the week. Now I just want to sit and eat it!

A most high 5 stars and this will be a DEFINITE repeat at our house!! 

Thanks Michelle, so much, for posting this winner of a recipe!!"
98063,87028,2005-03-21,4,"Very tasty soup! I used just 2 Tbsp of butter and low-fat sour cream which did not adversely affect the taste or texture. Also I used half smoked paprika and half regular, which was very good. I'm going to get fresh dill next time, that was the only thing that I thought really should be changed. And it does freeze well - BF didn't like it (he is all wrong!!!) so I had to freeze some for later and it was fine when I thawed it out. Thanks for the recipe! "
229009,115153,2005-07-15,5,"This is a great cauliflower recipe. It was so simple to make that I thought it couldn't possibly be that good. How wrong I was, it was delicious! My boyfriend said it was the best cauliflower he has ever had."
670089,108964,2009-08-30,5,"These were awesome! My Mom used to make these when I was little and that was one of the very few things I ate as a little kid. I was too lazy to clarify the butter, so I just melted it on low heat and watched the cutlets very closely to make sure they didn't burn. Once they were nice and golden brown on the outside, I turned off the heat, put all of them back in the pan (I had to fry them in two batches) and covered the pan with a lid and let it sit for about 5 minutes to make sure the inside was cooked through. These melt in your mouth! I served them with mashed potatoes (just like Mom used to) and am taking leftovers with me for lunch tomorrow. This one is definitely a keeper, thank you so much for sharing! UPDATE Instead of clarifying butter in a pan and standing over it to make sure it doesn't brown in step 4, I made this my step 1. Put the butter in a microwave-safe cup (a cup makes it easier to pour off the clarified butter leaving milk solids on the bottom), melt it, let it sit while I'm working on mixing the ingredients. Then I skim off the ""stuff"" that's floating on the top and slowly pour off the clarified butter into the pan where I'm going to fry the patties (careful not to pour in the solids that have settled on the bottom). While the pan with the butter is getting hot, I form my patties.  UPDATE#2 These freeze great!  Form the patties and freeze them on a sheet pan, once frozen you can transfer into freezer bags to save space.  I just made about 30 of these patties which will be about 7 meals for our family of 3.  Perfect for OAMC."
1814518,137495,2011-03-06,5,"Everyone loved this chowder. I only used 2 family sized Campbell Cream of Mushroom Soup, 2 cups of milk, 8 oz. of diced ham. And no cayenne pepper. Will use a little bit more corn next time also. Yummy to our tummy's."
115525,172062,2006-10-25,5,"I really loved this recipe! It was so fun to make - what a strange sight seeing all those 'fingers' going into the oven!  This 'Taste Of Home' recipe also tastes great.  I made them for my Cub Scout (6 - 11 year olds) Halloween party, and I think it may have been a bit too much for some of the boys.  They seemed a bit freaked at the thought of chomping on a finger!  I loved them and had several of the parents ask to take a few home for spouses.  Thanks for posting!"
1224782,107997,2009-07-31,5,My DH fell in love with the shrimp. He made me make it for his father. Thank you for posting this recipe.
469021,221275,2009-01-07,5,"I am so glad you posted this!  I've been looking for this recipe.  My mom used to make this for special events and potluck dinners.  We love this recipe!  Best when left to set overnight.  I have made this ligher by using Neufchatel (light cream cheese), Fat Free frozen whipped topping, sugar free puddings, and light margarine.  You can also reduce the amount of walnuts in the base, or make a graham-cracker crust instead."
1614515,82773,2010-05-12,0,"Excelente!
May I recommend using AJ's Walla Walla Sweet Onion mustard with this recipe, out of this world!"
537937,335132,2009-02-01,5,"I did these a bit differently than you have stated although.  I put the ribs in a big dutch oven and then poured all the other ingredients over.  Put them in the oven for 8-10 hours on 200 degrees.  Perfect.  They fell off the bone they were so moist.  A nice touch other than usual way of just throwing some bbq sauce over all.  Thanks for posting Wicked.~
Made for Holiday Tag!"
1571237,377585,2011-11-09,5,"So easy, and everyone in my family loves it!"
197023,261072,2009-06-06,5,"So easy, so delicious - and so very versatile - all element s that make this a recipe that I'll certainly be making again and again, and enjoy playing with a lot! :) On this occasion, I added some minced garlic, rosemary, sage and thymes (just have to include garlic and herbs). I used all of the optional ingredients and added a couple of handfuls of baby spinach leaves in step 4. I minced myy onion instead of chopping it; no risk then of it ruining the dish by its still being a bit crunchy. I used unsalted butter and low fat milk but regular cheese (low fat cheese? I'd rather omit it!) Thank you for a truly wonderful recipe! Made for Ali Baba's Babes for ZWT 5."
1800290124,497554,2013-12-01,5,I have made this 3 or 4 times in the last 6 months because my family loves it. I used sweet baby rays barbque sauce
220166,31286,2007-04-09,4,"This was pretty good!  Next time I think I will roast the potatoes a little longer until they are brown, and leave some of the cilantro out of the puree so the taste will come through a little stronger.  It seemed a little greasy but that could have been my own fault.  It had a wonderful flavor though.  Thanks!"
604073,330420,2010-10-25,5,"This was such a great easy dish to prepare.  We're not vegetarians, but the flavor in this dish was delightful.  I think next time, I may take half the sauce and marinate the tofu in it a little before cooking, but overall a delightful dish."
616177,411617,2014-06-19,5,"This was very good! I thought the proportions sounded off, not enough noodles for 2 cans of soup.....but it turns out perfect. Even the youngsters gobbled it up. This quick &amp; easy meal will be a regular in the dinner time line up at our house."
1179225,63446,2018-01-23,5,"Excellent! The only change I made was using brown basmati, so I double the cooking time. Loved it! Thanks for the recipe."
361238,8701,2007-10-20,5,"Delicious!  I omitted the garlic powder, old bay seasoning, onion powder and celery salt because I didn't have any.  I found another spice that had most of those in it, so I used that instead.  I cooked it at 300* for 3 hours.  My family and I loved it.  I will definitely be making this again.  Next time I will add a little more honey and barbecue sauce."
752595,49534,2008-02-04,5,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, these cookies. They are so moist and delicious. The only bad thing is that I just can't stop eating them."
2000695358,458842,2015-11-20,1,Horrible taste and horrible to pipe!!!
487548,289343,2008-04-01,5,"Now my family favorite also!!  I use eye-of-round because of the fat levels but also because of that my roasts are usually tough, dry and not much taste.  This recipe came out beautifully tender, moist and flavorful.    The only other change I did was to omit the salt (enough in the canned tomatoes, broth and V-8 juice.  Thank You so much for this keeper!"
31083,116266,2008-02-08,5,"I made this for a Super bowl gathering and there was very little left. I did use Ranch and left out the chopped celery based on previous reviews. I served it with celery sticks and crackers, and some people used the Fritos I had out for something else. My son ate the leftovers as a sandwich on a roll the next day. I am already planning when I will make this next."
358095,28165,2009-03-10,4,"Oh, yum!  This was very good, and VERY easy!  Next time, I will use more sausage and less chicken.  I used chicken breast, boiled and shredded, rather than thigh meat.  I also added quite a bit of cayenne (we like spice!)  I had several requests for the recipe from my company.  Thanks Sue!"
288587,110604,2007-04-22,5,"This cake was simply wonderful!  I like lemon cake, but I have never had a craving for one.  But after baking, and partaking, I will definitely prepare this cake often.  I brought the cake to work, and 15 mins. later it was gone.  I have always believed icing was neccessary for a cake, but this recipe definitely proves me wrong.  Thanks so much for the great recipe."
2001681622,32880,2018-09-11,5,Just made this and it was just delicious. I've tried many zucchini bread recipes over the years but this one is the hands down best. I used even more cinnamon and the raisins are a great addition. Warmed with a little butter - what a treat.
270212,22539,2007-10-15,4,I thought this turned out great. Very fast and easy to put together. I used ground turkey and cottage cheese and it turned out great. Will make again for sure.
895132,401282,2010-01-14,5,"Very tasty and easy to make sweet treat! I used only 1 cup brown rice syrup, no other sweetener, and 85 percent chocolate. Also I didn't have the chocolate hazelnut butter but only plain hazelnut butter. It was plenty sweet for my taste, very rich and satisfying. Thanks for posting!!
Made for Comfort Cafe January 2010."
89831,168258,2006-09-14,5,"I saw this recipe in Chatelaine magazine a while back and have made it many times only using fresh garlic, its an easy recipe that is really big on taste, thanks for sharing Elly!...Kitten:)"
383795,92660,2009-05-11,5,"this is one of those recipes that i would give 7 stars to. I read the ingredients and thought ,""I wonder how the garlic and butter can flavor the whole lot of popcorn?"". Wow, it really does! The popcorn is buttery, very garlicky, and the cheese really finishes the whole thing off. This is my new favorite. Thanks!"
573325,367044,2009-09-18,5,"This is an AMAZING bread recipe!!!
The loaf was so light and spongy with a great cinnamon flavour. I was a little sceptical and thought it would be too much cinnamon, but it was just perfect!
This is wonderful for a chilly fall/winters day when all you want is some hot tea and some yummy cake. Mmm, it is pure comfort food to me.
I made only half the recipe and left out the raisins, but I think Ill add them next time just to see if the bread is very different then.
Oh, and I reduced the sugar by half, which was still sweet enough for me.
THANKS SO VERY MUCH for sharing this lovely recipe with us, Lady Morrgian! Ill definitely make it again!
Made and reviewed for one of my babies during PAC Fall 09."
128473,450096,2012-08-29,5,"This crumble is dynamite.  I made it using strawberry, blueberry, blackberries and rhubarb.  This was awesome.  The  crumble was delicious, perfectly paired, loved the topping.  It was so quick and easy to make.  I  made a quarter of the recipe and got two beautiful crumbles which I made in two medium size ramakins.  Thanks for sharing this lovely recipe.  Made for the Fearless Red Dragons - ZWT8 - Family Picks Round"
143387,46501,2006-02-27,5,Very easy and very delicious.  I made 3 loaves out of this recipe.  Baguette size.
1238566,310310,2010-03-27,4,"Great texture, but really salty. I would probably halve the salt. Other than that it was quite nice, though."
653438,445697,2013-02-26,5,This soup was a great way to use up the veggies in the fridge and give us a warm bowl of soup and the beach (the wind made it chilly).  I would definately make this again.  Thank you for posting.  Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag game.
322381,202200,2007-01-11,3,"This was tasty. I've only ever had eggplant adobo which I also found on Zaar. It was very easy to make, although I used breasts and next time will use thighs because I do think they'll be better. I also liked how the potatoes didn't get mushy. The only thing is- it took MUCH longer to prepare/marinate/cook this dish than the 1 hour stated. I'd say with prep, marination and cooking it took almost 2 hrs 15 minutes."
851841,241042,2012-04-16,5,"I didn't have any sour cream on hand besides I try to cut the calories down as much as possible so I substituted FF plain Yogurt for the sour cream.  I used cream of mushroom soup as that is what I had on hand.  Used Pepper Jack cheese.  I thinned the sour cream, chicken, cheese mixture with a can, ( 14 oz), of Old El Paso Enchilada Sauce. and threw in a small can of sliced black olives into the mix.  Other than that I followed the recipe without the chilies. (ONLY because I didn't have any!)  This recipe I thought was good, but my DH thought it was fantastic!! That's why the 5 star rating. Will definitely make this again but put some habaneros or other hot chilies in it.  Thanks for the gr8 recipe."
460048,301865,2009-07-14,5,"Fantastic!  I served this on a bed of spring greens - mmmm! So light for summer, too!"
386585,272971,2009-11-04,5,"You couldn't ask for anything easier!  I made this recipe exactly as posted, using minced garlic, adding some black pepper, and omitting the capers.  I also used Ken's Lite Country French Dressing.  It was delicious, and I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for posting this keeper."
96359,71227,2004-01-06,4,Magnificent; though the sauce quantity could probably be reduced by 1/3.  Makes a hard-glazing.  Stunning flavor contrast between the sweet maple syrup and the bitter ginger & orange rind.  Great eating.
486725,60820,2014-05-01,4,"Really good. I did follow other reviewers and doubled the spices (except the chili powder - actually I used cayenne because my Indian chili powder is very hot), did just a quick saut&eacute; and added a squeeze of lemon at the end."
513933,401483,2017-08-22,5,All I can say is YUMMY!
135017,77666,2007-01-03,5,"These are great!  Super-easy, mixed it up in the baking pan.  Perfect over ice cream.  Thanks, Elmo! -Orchid"
179133,461075,2011-08-20,4,"This is a very hearty, thick meat sauce. I had an 8 oz can of tomato sauce so used the whole thing rather than have 2 oz left over. I also used 1 tsp Better than Bouillon concentrate for the bouillon cube. Otherwise followed the recipe except I added a step - I grated the zucchini as suggested but then put it in a colander with 1/2 tsp kosher salt and let it drain (after squeezing gently, I had about 1/3 cup liquid! I discarded the liquid.) Served over linguine with a sprinkle of Parmesan. Garlic bread would be an excellent accompaniment (will have to get some to go with the leftovers!) I will say that this probably serves more like 5-6 (not 3-4), at least in my house. Thanks for sharing and good luck in the contest! ~Aug 17, 2001. UPDATE: Had to add that I cooked some orecchiette to go with the leftovers and I found it easier to eat as the shape of the pasta held the meat sauce better. Also topped with sharp cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan and it was ooey gooey yummy! Served with garlic bread this time too! :) Thanks again!"
270514,105260,2007-10-10,5,I completely skipped the browning part of the recipe as my pork chops were really thin.  Placed 4 in a glass casserole dish and added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup with the rest of the ingredients.  Cooked this in a 375 degree oven for about 45 minutes.  DH LOVED it. Thanks!
813515,61827,2008-05-20,5,You can really taste the Grand Marnier in this!!  It is absolutely delicious!!  I used only 1 TBSP of zest and I used whole wheat pastry flour and it still got a lot of lift!!  This recipe is very easy to follow!  Thanks for a great recipe for souffle!!!
354763,105051,2006-11-28,5,My DH loved this and now wants me to make the dressing to put on all our salads. I did cut down a bit on the garlic because we're not big garlic lovers. Thanks for a really good dressing.
61660,211496,2007-03-19,4,"I thought this was a very simple recipe to put together.  I served with eggs and toast one sunday morning.  While I enjoyed the sausage, I kept thinking of burgers and really think this would be great on a bun with cheese and ketchup, sort of like a sausage burger.  Maybe with a little more seasoning added, it would be more of what I think of for sausage.  Overall, DH and I both thought these were good."
293102,208369,2008-03-10,0,Everyone wanted this recipe.  Definitely a keeper. Delicious!
1365025,403492,2009-12-14,0,"Thank you, thank you. I was wondering how to go about freezing cauliflower, my favorite veggie. I will definitely give this a try."
993476,323117,2008-10-18,4,"They were very fluffy.  The texture was great.  They came apart very easily.  There was only one thing missing -- flavor.  They tasted bland.  If they would have had a nice, savory buttery flavor, they would have been absolutely perfect.  Next time I make them, I will try using butter instead of shortening.  I used ""Butter Crisco Shortening"" this time.  I need to do some experimenting and ask around for some suggestions.  I do recommend this recipe, though.  All it needs is flavor, and it makes the perfect biscuit!"
510313,323677,2008-09-22,5,"Made & reviewed for Ramadan Tag in the NA*ME Forum. I made just this recipe (as I already had some homemade dough left over from previous pies!) This filling is beautiful, pefectly spiced & well balanced. We all loved the finished pies! Thanks so much for a delicious recipe....Ramadan Mubarak :)"
2021204,161430,2011-10-01,4,"I agree this is a fabulous recipe. The only reason I rated it 4 rather than 5 stars is that the olives are over the top. Even with 4 enthusiastic olives eaters sharing this meal, I would cut back the olives by at least a half. Otherwise, it is awesome and I will for sure make this again."
211184,319384,2008-10-12,4,"A little different and very good. I saw I had a box of red jello in the pantry and assumed it was cherry. It was actually Cranberry Raspberry and worked deliciously in this recipe. I was a little surprised by the time it took my jello mixture to thicken, about 4 hours, but I am guessing the milk added to the time. Thanks for sharing. *Made for Fall PAC 2008*"
355144,199795,2012-07-31,0,"I haven't made this yet, but plan to soon.  For those on WW this comes out at 10 Pts. on my WW calculator, so be aware of what you add to the rest of the meal.  Maybe a nice tossed salad."
439797,371606,2010-11-10,5,"I made this in my rice cooker.  First I sauteed the vegetables and meat then threw everything in the rice cooker.  It look a little extra chicken broth, but otherwise worked really well.  I used ham and shrimp as the meat, but did everything else to the recipe - except I didn't have any green onions.  It does smell great!"
142200,142729,2005-11-12,4,"I used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend in place of regular brown sugar.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  These bars are soft, chewy and great tasting.  Thank you for posting this healthy and yummy recipe!"
110210,24217,2006-04-21,5,"Made these as part of our Easter dinner. Man, are they good! I was originally going to use cheddar cheese, but stuck to the recipe instead. They are terrific and easy. No one would ever know they came from a box. We'll make these again. Thanks!! "
153101,59668,2004-07-19,4,I altered this slightly in the fact that I added 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  My family loved it.  Thank you!
1579905,61333,2012-08-13,5,I also loved the infusions and I also added garlic.  Thank you!
2001174394,133751,2016-09-18,4,"Made this by exact instructions, and it thickened up immediately without adjustment. I did find it a little sweeter than my liking on initial tasting, and added a dash more soy sauce. Love this recipe."
46046826,71373,2014-04-28,0,These are the best rolls ever......I have been making them for years....I make hoagie rolls with this recipe my family absolutely loves them.....always get compliments on them....I have used several different types of bread flour and my favorite flour is King Arthur.....if you can&#039;t get that White Lily is my second choice....DO NOT alter or make any changes to this recipe....they are so easy to make and very very delicious.....you will never be disappointed in these.....also I have used a pizza dough recipe on here for years also....easy peezy pizza dough.....very good and easy also......
246482,425704,2010-05-28,5,We loved this and yes it has a bite but  its good. Made for Zwt6 for the Xtra Hot Dishes
37305,268411,2007-12-06,4,"This recipe is 5 star delicious, but the texture is what I'm not crazy about.  These ended up very crumbly, even though I reduced the confectioners' sugar down to 2.5 cups.  I waited until these were at room temperature (from the fridge) before attempting to cut.  I followed the recipe exact, so I'm not sure why the texture wasn't more fudge-like.  The mixture did not ""pour"" into the pan, it sort of had to be pressed into it.  As a peanut butter candy these are yummy, but I can't say it's like fudge.  Thanks!  (P.S. I topped these with melted chocolate chips because I love peanut butter and chocolate!)"
264017,287276,2012-02-25,4,"Very good! I made this tonight using a fully cooked rotisserie chicken, whole wheat lasagna noodles, lowfat cottage cheese and lowfat mozzarella. No one knew it was on the ""healthy"" side. The only ingredient I added was 1 tsp. Italian seasoning to the sauce. The ingredient lists a roasting chicken, but doesn't say if it should be cooked or not (not all chefs may know to cook it first); and also it's listed to use cottage cheese, but the directions call for ricotta. I covered the dish with foil while baking for 40 minutes, then removed it for 10 minutes."
2750190,443758,2013-04-09,5,"Super easy, which I love. And they tasted great!  All 5 kids devoured them!  Thanks for a quick, easy idea!"
141654,86983,2008-12-14,5,This was excellent.  Made it for a party and had NONE left over.  This is a keeper.
424544,151090,2007-02-14,5,"Very Good,  The sweet and spicy taste is a great combination.  Easy To make.  I just followed your directions"
158086,223028,2007-09-04,5,"great recipe, the only thing I changed was put sliced fresh morzerella cheese on top....turned out wonderful"
39835,96139,2005-05-04,4,Good salad which uses a lot of things I usually have on hand. For the vinaigrette I used olive oil and sherry vinegar. This is a great way to use up leftover rice and chicken. Thanks for sharing.
295691,121441,2006-09-02,5,"Wow, cooked this for a total of 27 people Thursday Evening at an organization that I belong to.  I cook one meal a month for them. 
This was awesome.    
Made it precisely according to recipe and it was simply devine.
Im not sure that a few red pepper flakes would not also suffice in enhancing the taste. 
But this was perfect just the way it was written.
After browing, I put them into the <a href=""/48545"">Hot Tomato Sauce</a>, Hot Tomato Sauce. 
thanks 
Tasty and very refreshing.
Chef Angela Marie"
420929,152596,2007-04-09,4,"Really great, probably would have been better had I remembered the turkey : )  I kept wondering why it wasn't a ""club"" sandwich until I remembered...  but is was really good.  I think the recipe writer meant Dijon mustard, at least that's what I used."
382071,134924,2007-12-02,5,This is an OUTSTANDING brown rice recipe! It bakes up perfectly and has a wonderful flavor. I made it as directed but omitted the red pepper flakes. I will make this again and again. Freddy Cat says hi!
37106,20786,2004-05-22,5,Wow! What a quick and delicious meal. We just loved this. I was able to pull it all together within 30 minutes. Served with warm flour tortillas and sour cream. Can't get over how easy it was and how much the family enjoyed this one! Thanks Kirstin!!!!!!!!
107583,217178,2007-06-19,5,"This is very tasty!  I used Splenda instead of sugar, because marmalade has plenty of sugar in it.  I am going to hunt down some ginger marmalade and try that version!  Makes a nice high loaf."
679953,146288,2009-10-21,5,"The only thing I did different was halve this.  OUTSTADING soup that we enjoyed for lunch.   Wouldn't change again .  Great flavors, taste, and simple to prepare and  make.  Might add extra chili powder next time, personnal preference.  Made for PRMR tag."
2002227190,476538,2018-10-23,4,"There are 2 kinds of Marsala, sweet, and dry. Both work well for this dish but have very different flavors. Both are excellent."
108488,203634,2010-03-28,5,"LOVE this recipe! I add a finely chopped onion as some of the reveiwers suggested. Had 1 sweet potato so I added that along with the white potatoes. It looked so lovely! My 2 year old and 1 year old along with myself nearly ate the whole thing on our own! It was soooo delicious. The next time I made it I didn't have any sweet potatoes so I added some carrots (to get that lovely contrast). An unexpected guest arrived, so I added an extra potato and apple and doubled the sauce. It has just the right amount of sugar.. not too sweet for us. Had it with green beans."
92816,151565,2006-06-23,5,Excellent recipe.It would be great with any kind of pudding.The only thing I would do diffently would be to double up on the bottom layer ingredients.As it is now it barely covers the bottom of the pan.I am also going to add some chopped pistachio nuts to the top of this.Thanks for the great recipe.
920589,300178,2009-06-09,3,Good but a bit too runny for me-- I added 1/4 c. less olive oil and 1/4 cup more parmesean. Also extremely garlic-y as it is-- I love garlic so I made the mistake of adding an extra clove-- dont do it!
1405270,68274,2010-11-10,4,"I had a package of dried cherries someone gave me so I thought what the hey. When I first made the sauce I changed my mind and thought; never again. You add this sauce to the chicken and oh WOW is it fantastic!!!! Now, I am not one for using salt which I did not instead I used Emeril's Essence that I make by hand omitting half the salt when I do. I placed it on both sides of the chicken before grilling. I will absolutely make this again!"
324390,179854,2007-04-17,5,This was my first time making rice pilaf and this recipe made it so easy. It comes together really quickly and its subtle flavors made a nice side dish to recipe #199529. I will be making this rice often! Thanks Bobbie!
212609,444127,2011-05-01,5,"The humble potato is so versatile, and can be flavoured in so many ways, that we often overlook the obvious.<br/>This recipe is a great reminder that you really don't have to do much to produce great results.<br/>I served with chipotle mayo and Sharon's own recipe# 202316#202316, which is delicious!<br/>A fab Saturday night munchie snack, that DH and I both enjoyed so very much.<br/>Thanks Sharon. Made for 123 Hits."
1138497,313028,2009-02-16,5,"Excellent recipe!  Almost identical to the real thing.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only substitution I made was 1 cup of water, 1 cup of whole milk and 5 tbsp of vinegar for the buttermilk.  I have made these twice and would recommend NOT using silicon baking pans as it expands horizontally.  The second time around, I used mini loaf pans and only baked them for 30 minutes.  These browned nicely and made perfect size crackers!  Thanks for the recipe!"
55221,116230,2005-10-10,5,"This pie is quite delicious with a nice thick-bodied texture, but very, very rich. It's so rich, in fact, that each member of my family found it difficult to finish an entire slice. For purposes of waistline non-expansion ;) I suggest serving this pie cut into 12 - 16 narrow slices and maybe posting a little warning sign near it that states: ""Danger - Curves Ahead!"" "
226066,218629,2007-04-30,5,What's not to love in this?? :)!!  This is perfect comfort food!  We loved the mix of spinach and cheese.  Used low-fat milk and some leeks instead of the shallots.  Can't wait to have the leftovers!! Thanks Cynna!  Made for PAC 2007.
166642,256001,2008-03-22,5,These bars taste exactly like the name implies - like a chocolate truffle brownie! They are crunchy and fudge-like at the same time. Decadent and rich. Any chocolate lover should really enjoy these bars! Be sure to have a glass of milk with these!
284922,42367,2008-01-28,5,"We enjoyed these very much!  The little darlings baked up full and moist!  I had never made a cake batter from scratch before and was delighted at how well this turned out!  Thanks so much for posting your recipe, it is a keeper :)"
1329782,241030,2009-11-07,5,"Great flavor.  Had this a few weeks ago and realized I never rated it.  Sorry.  Great flavor, perfect on the grill. We had 10 of us, so all different but similar flavors ... in the steak, shrimp and chicken dishes.  The chicken was definitely a hit.  Definitely keep the recipe.  I love recipes like that, that are so versatile.  Great flavors as always."
166019,146427,2010-08-10,4,These we're so good. I will have to cut back to 1 tbsp of chili powder becuase I have young kids.. Thanks for posting such a great recipe.
465968,89204,2009-03-17,5,I LOVE this! But tonight I got creative. Followed the recipe exactly only when it was done cooking I added about a teaspoon of cumin and shredded the chicken and mixed everything up. I then placed some of the chicken mixture in tortillas and rolled them up like enchiladas. Lined them up in a baking dish and poured white cheese sauce over them covered them with cheese and baked them about 15 minutes at 350 degrees. YUMMY!!  SO GOOD!!!
1094446,51306,2010-06-07,5,"Kind of amazing.  I made my own crust of 2 2/12 cups Multigrain Cheerios (crushed), 3 tbsp sugar and 1/4 butter baked at 350F for 10 mins.  I also used a bit less cream cheese and nutella, since I had only about 13 oz of (light) cream cheese to bake with.  Quick, easy and most importantly, delicious."
29063,14888,2007-01-10,4,This was one of the prettiest dishes I've made in a long time. The range of colors of the veggies was just beautiful We really liked this but would triple the sauce amount next time since we didn't think there was quite enough.  It was very easy to throw together however and nice for a busy work night. Thanks!
705251,235408,2010-02-11,5,Okay this freaked out me out the way it was prepared but in the end the flavor won everyone over.  I did have to use frozen baby petite peas as fresh are out of season.  I did try the lettuce and it was not something I enjoyed but that is not what this recipe is about so 5 stars for the flavor and texture of the peas after preparing in this fashion.  Made for the I Recommend Tag Game based on Karen's review.
2001702832,15477,2017-09-06,5,Husband and kids loved these we used dove chocolate for the drizzle and they were amazing made 4 dozen!
121690,136946,2006-08-14,5,"Oh, yum! I actually made these under the broiler, using MacIntosh apples. They turned out great!  It's a side dish that absolutely seems to cry out for pork, but steak was what I had and it tasted excellent with that, too. The onion rings DID separate, but who cares?"
1072593,463947,2013-03-11,5,Too good health!  Along with the eye cream from the fountain of youth and hair dye with 100% coverage.
296809,240465,2017-02-21,5,"Made for the Best of 2016 tag game @ FF&amp;F as a favorite of Maito - For reasons I've never fully understood, goats cheese is hard to find here in Iceland. So I researched it on the net &amp; read that simple cream cheese was 1 of 3-4 reasonable subs. So I used it &amp; made the recipe as written except for adding sprinkled dry dill &amp; lemon pepper. I used a mixed bread combo that included flatbread, dark pumpernickel (bakery) &amp; thin-sliced rye (bagels &amp; Eng muffins would also work well). Unlike your intro comment suggested, these ingredients are much-favored staples of the Icelandic kitchen &amp; often eaten for breakfast, lunch, afternoon coffee, starter courses &amp; even w/a sweet treat for dessert. Thx for sharing this yummy recipe w/us. We loved it!"
45059129,14186,2014-04-24,5,"Super, super good!!! Has a nice, richer flavor that doesn&#039;t always come with regular pumpkin pies. I also added 1/4 tsp of cloves. One thing that I think really set this over the edge was evaporating the soymilk. Instead of just using a cup of it, I put 3 cups of the milk over low-medium heat and waited for to evaporate down to one cup. I actually wasn&#039;t paying attention, and it ended up being a little less than one cup, but I didn&#039;t have any troubles! It added a nice creaminess that I think is worth the patience. :) I also used a pecan/oat crust instead of the one in the recipe, so I can&#039;t vouch for that part."
1625628,133056,2010-07-30,4,Very nice and moist cake. I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2c and increased the lime to 2t. I also added 1/2c of shredded coconut. I didn't make the glaze and it was still lovely
79772,23789,2004-08-23,4,Nice and easy streusel cake. The bottom was very light and fluffy. I used walnuts and the cake turned out very nice. It keeps well too.
229619,111413,2006-08-17,5,"Oh yum!  Just like chili dogs only easier to eat.  I used Pillsbury cornbread twists for the crust and only sprinkled onion on one half since I have a couple of kids who don't like it.  Quick, easy and good."
47892,257927,2010-04-23,5,Delicious and healthy and simple to prepare. No fresh pomegranate seeds are available this time of year and I substituted dried pomegranate seeds. Interesting combination of flavors. Thank you for sharing your recipe. Reviewed for TOTM.
870705,60160,2012-08-10,4,"This is a good scalloped potato recipe.  I used less onion than was called for and followed the suggestion of another reviewer and covered the dish for 25 minutes, then baked them uncovered for 20 more.  Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup cooking game."
253283,361842,2009-05-04,5,This really satisfies the chocolate cravings in a modest serving size - so I don't feel guilty about eating it for a late night snack. I stirred in some chocolate chips and cooked it 30 seconds at 1000W.
617508,30018,2008-10-09,5,"This soup was all sorts of wonderful. I had an empty fridge, so I substituted some of the vegetables with a whole bag of frozen broccoli stir-fry. Tossed everything for 25 mins on the pressure cooker and added the barley for another 5 mins at the end. Totally delicious and filling soup."
311757,165563,2007-08-12,5,I made this for dinner tonight and it was soooo good! I will definitely be making this again and again!!
2001924259,355130,2018-01-10,5,Worked great...but your servings are awfully large! 3 pounds of bacon for 6 people?
222055,97523,2007-06-10,5,Great little muffins! I used the minnie muffin pan and got 24. I cooked them for 18 minutes. I used butter because I have no margarine and I first saw that others did so I felt good about it. I used less butter for the tops (what was left on my stick after the first five T) and had to double the cinnamon sugar mixture. I rolled some completely and just topped most of them. Thank you Dreamgoddess!
184594,122836,2005-05-23,5,This was great I love It!!
514475,90674,2013-02-09,0,"YUM! Used wheat bread, Splenda instead of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla (oh... okay.. plus put the remainder of the vanilla bottle in there! It wasn't THAT much : )  Anyway.... SOOO GOOD! Definitely will be using this recipe again!"
187069,45602,2005-01-23,4,"Very interesting! Reminded me of a roti but crunchier. My husband added more curry and I would like to add some chicken strips the next time I make it. You really do need a food processor or at the very least, a mini-prep, as chopping the spinach would be quite time consuming by hand. I felt it needed another spice but wasn't sure what to add. More curry didn't do it. Any suggestions?
I really liked the way the tortilla firmed up and stayed slightly crunchy after heating. I'm not sure my tortillas ""puffed"" but they did brown - took about 15 minutes. We had them for dinner - they were very filling. Only used 1/2 of the recipe with great leftovers for lunch later in the week. "
1485581,131018,2010-08-23,0,Wonderful the meet fell apart and the onions just kind of metled into the meet.
415204,45784,2006-12-24,5,I found this to be outstanding..will never buy store bought sauce again..used capt. morgan spiced rum instead of brandy and it added to the taste..also cut down on the amount of sugar as others suggested..
362983,114749,2009-12-25,5,"Oh wow, these are delicious! It has the perfect amount of banana flavour in every bite. Mm! I forgot to set the temperature down to 250 during the second half, so I ended up cutting down the baking time at the end since obviously the biscotti was getting darker faster than I had intended, but it all turned out fine in the end. Though next time, I would do the first baking time for less than what was called for.. maybe 18-20 minutes, as the bottoms got really DARK brown after being in there for 23 minutes. I also used walnuts instead of pecans.. it was like banana nut bread in biscotti form! Soo good! I can't wait to have it with some tea tonight. Thanks :)"
70570,52362,2003-02-04,5,"You know I love this one, Mom!! So when are you going to make it for me??"
68884,110726,2005-02-16,4,"This is pretty good. The problem I had is the amount of spices was TOO much. The combo is flavorful, but it really, really coated the zucchini and the pan. Next time, I'll halve the spices. I piled on a plate, sprinkled with some low-fat cheddar & a bit of cooked bacon, and dipped in some ranch dressing -- a la ""Loaded Fries"" ;) -- instead of the chili sauce. Thanks for the recipe."
579298,108775,2007-12-02,5,"Are you a believer in Love At First Bite?? I wasn't but now I am! I am not a fan of fish, but I know that if cooked right (like Pecan Crusted Grouper from one of my fav restaurants) I eat it up. I have been on a mission to unravel only the best of the best recipes for fish - in order to incorporate it into my diet. And this one, so far, TOPS the list. For those of you non-believers out there, you need to try this one.... you surely will fall in love. I myself, used honey butter in stead of regular butter (and still added honey), and in addition to the bread crumbs I used wheat germ, for just a slight bit more additional nutrients. 1/8 cup Wheat Germ & 1/8 cup bread crumbs. Dijon mustard, Pecans and a Lemon were the rest of my choices. TigerJo, you should have kept this recipe a secret, but boy am I glad you didn't!"
258115,101789,2007-01-02,5,Very easy to make. I marinated it over night. I would not change a thing. Friends and family raved about it. It was gone within 5 minutes. Next time I'll have to increase the amount. Thanks for sharing!
651350,210757,2010-02-21,4,"This was good, but way TOO HOT!  I used regular rotel, not hot, but next time I would use only half a can.  For this batch I added some milk and that helped cut the heat.  We liked it, but it was way too hot for us."
2001478815,237495,2017-04-09,5,"I made this for my grandson's birthday. You should have seen his face! Now every wants it for their big day as well. Thank you, this was great!"
42817523,96523,2013-09-01,5,"Made these for a function recently, and they got rave reviews!  I made them bite-sized (quite small) and got nearly 100 balls out of a double recipe.  The key to making these is mixing the ingredients VERY thoroughly - I did this by wearing cooking gloves and mixing it with my gloved hands.  Then, wearing the gloves, it&#039;s very easy to roll nice little bite-sized balls.  Fun to eat and really good!"
1251027,84987,2009-04-29,0,"this recipe wsa awsome. We used this for pizza rolls. I doubled the recipe and then made individual balls then rolled them with the rolling pin, then put cheese and meat and veggies in the middle, athen folded them in half. Don't make them too thin. I cooked them for about 15  min and voila they were a hit. We were stuffed after eating two. This recipe doubled makes about ten pizza rolls."
189616,65911,2005-05-09,5,"Wow-this was GREAT, so very moist. 
Thank You-Shawnee TX"
2694379,28768,2013-02-17,4,My family thought this was GREAT. I don't know if I would say the best ever but it was good. I think my only problem with it was because I am use to using ricotta cheese and tried cottage cheese this time. Next time I make it I will give it a try with ricotta cheese. I will tell you that the beef mixture with the spices and tomatoes was REALLY REALLY good.
465056,194339,2007-09-19,5,I didn't realize when I picked this recipe that this was very similar to a recipe my MIL use to make.  When I tasted it I was quite surprised to have found her lost recipe.  I think she used more dill though.  I will definitely make this again but I will double the dill.
538835,30698,2007-12-28,5,"Super yummy recipe!  It took way longer to cook it, though, because I used brown rice.  I will probably make this once a month or so!"
1855913,82102,2011-04-11,2,I'm going to be honest. I usually love my recipes from food.com with high ratings. This one was dry. My boyfriend didn't even eat half of it.
492485,77666,2007-05-23,5,Very easy and delicious!  Cut the recipe in half and still turned out yummy!
146284,121205,2006-06-11,5,"I can add no higher praise than the intro, which we found to be absolutely true. The taste is fabulous,the method uncomplicated, and the finished product looks great. What more could you ask?"
1058174,307052,2012-01-25,0,"I did not like this recipe. The directions were very confusing. Parts were listed in grams and others in cups or teaspoon/tablespoons.. I followed the directions as listed. The only thing I changed was that I added some tarragon. I know it's not because this is considered ""diet"". I have been on weight watchers for 4 years so I am used to eating low fat. This was not creamy at all and just didn't taste good."
60992,53048,2004-06-01,5,"This dip is fantastic! I have made it many times and find out it turns out best (much less greasy) if you use light mayonnaise. This is SO good spread on a crusty slice of bagette with an icey cold beer to follow. And now with Vidalias in season, whatcha waiting for?? You simply have to try this!"
1339111,297812,2009-08-05,5,Excellent Cookies!! Very easy to bake  and great with espresso coffee. My DH loved this recipe very much... he couldn't get enough! Thanks for posting.
268611,228330,2018-08-11,5,"Very, very good and simple. Need to quadruple it the next time, itâs so good. I like a spicy bite so Iâm going to double the hot pepper mix. Hint, donât get rid of all the juice out of the veg as a juicy relish is far more appetizing than a dried out one. Youâre welcome."
2000292079,364882,2017-08-09,0,I made this for my Mom and Sister and they loved it - Way to many compliments - Great simple dish!

919613,272391,2009-02-03,5,"I loved this recipe because the seasonings make it very tasty.  I am not a fan of bland recipes.  It takes a really good recipe to please me and not cause me to tweak it to my liking.  I didn't have rolled oats.  So, I used cooked steel cut oats.  I think the rolled would've been better to make a more firm loaf.  I omitted the egg and used the full 1/2 teaspoon of seasoning salt.  Awesomeness!"
431813,305026,2008-06-09,5,"Five stars for the tasty simplicity!  We really enjoyed this salad.  The toppings did not overpower the tomato flavour, which was very nice.    We will definitely enjoy this again.  Thanks Sue L!  Made for ZWT 4."

1135521,14186,2011-11-05,5,"Another review just reviewing the filling - I had grown pumpkins this year so wanted to try a pie.  Used 2.5 c fresh pumpkin in lieu of the canned.  The filling was so amazingly tasty uncooked my kids would have done shots of it had I let them.  I didn't have any molasses, so just used 1/2 T of dark brown sugar as a substitute.  End result was a very good pie.  I used Food.com recipe 51537 for a no-roll pie crust which was a super easy perfect compliment to the filling."
675265,219073,2008-01-17,5,"Wow, this was some gooooooood fudge! Everyone in the house loved it.  I did the same thing the previous posted suggested, with using a lg. tablespoon and just stuck it in the peanut butter and marshmallow jars and pulled out a big gob and plopped it in the pan for each tablespoon called for in the recipe.  I made sure I got the temp up to 238 and worked out well.  Thanks for sharing!  Wiggie"

For those of us who value culinary quality and variety it is rare to find a fresh new taste that is not difficult or time consuming to make, but in my book, this does it.  I took your lead and paired it with a soup (in my case, Potato Mushroom Chowder #26739), and it was fantastic.  On top of all that, I learned some new cooking skills--like how to marinate mozzarella cheese, and how to make Boboli crust taste homemade!  You took all the problems of a pizza with salad toppings or a salad alone and solved them beautifully!  Thank you, thank you!"

854842,70287,2008-06-05,0,Very easy to prep.My Husband loves it and so do I.We have our owen blueberry bushes. Thank you for a great recipe.lln
384041,106298,2007-12-09,3,"Very tasty, but I'm not sure its tasty enough to warrant the work. DH complained about the overly-soft texture of the meatballs that had been simmered rather than browned. I had to add extra water to the broth as I cooked somewhere between 7 and 9 batches of meatballs (I lost count).

Still, the flavor is very rich and intricate and, despite the heartiness of the sour-cream gravy, the capers and lemon kept it from seeming overly-heavy. I'm not sure I'd make it again, but I might use the same seasonings in a meat loaf.

Note: Not having ground veal or ground pork available, I used 2lbs of ground chuck and 1 lb of ground turkey."
57400,211060,2007-07-30,5,"I followed your recipe to the letter and I am a believer.  Smooth, creamy and wonderful.  WOW!"
427184,159657,2008-09-21,5,"These are fantastic. This recipe is very very good. Thank you also for your own notes. I did also use 1.5 tsp of black pepper and I'm so glad I did. I also cut down a tad on the sugar which worked perfect for us. The pine nuts add a very distinct flavour, and I wouldn't think of removing them. Thanks so much for a great recipe."
962690,114908,2008-11-09,5,"I had to use jalepenos and used celery since I had no zucchini but this is a KEEPER.
Very tasty soup.
I did this recipe for Zaar Iron chef challenge"
302445,24548,2008-02-11,5,This recipe was a BIG hit; I also substituted a cup of sugar & 1/4 cup of molasseses for the brown sugar and changed the pineapple chunks to crushed pineapple - both were really good.
114882,71373,2014-01-12,5,"This is a truly wonderful bread - very light, fluffy, and full of flavor!  Turns out perfectly ... every time.  I&#039;m going to use this recipe to make Parker House Rolls for our office party this week..  Mahalo Nui Loa for sharing."
1909732,383692,2011-05-15,2,"very tasty, but it fell apart:( how do you get it out of the pans so that it dosent completly crumble into pieces!?!"
442988,87782,2007-12-01,5,"Another happy customer!  Loved these.  I used a mixture of red, blue, and Yukon gold potatoes, and they were extremely yummy.  Used at least ten cloves of garlic, and you were right -- more is better here.  Loved the method of adding water to the olive oil.  Thanks so much for posting this!"
2001612640,342042,2017-07-08,4,"After reading reviews, I altered the amounts. For the batter, I used 1 cup bisquick, 3/4 c. 1% milk, and 1/4 melted butter. It was still really runny so I sprinkled more bisquick in it until I had cake batter consistency. I'm thinking a half cup milk or 1-1/4 cup bisquik might be the right combination. I used 3 medium and 1 small fresh peach and followed Persian Berry 2011 below by boiling the peaches with 3/4 c. Sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and starch. I didn't have any lemon juice on had but it did not seem to make any difference."
2001861123,51104,2017-12-16,0,I just live this recipe I took 2 batches to work every one lived them and they want more baked soon. It doesn't need to be a holiday to bake these cookies.
111347,77774,2007-09-09,5,This was excellent!  I left out the egg and doubled the recipe.  I put this in a really large pan so we could have extra the next night as well.  I threw in extra mozzarella and parmesan.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!
668861,139668,2009-02-12,5,Excellent!!! Thanks for posting!! I can't wait to suprise the kids with these.
663717,113490,2007-11-23,5,"I have searched a long time for a Pecan Cobbler recipe like a restaurant here used to serve.  I am convinced this is it.  The oat flour is the secret ingredient.  It was easy to prepare, and easier to devour.  Thanks for sharing!"
52282,67517,2004-03-09,4,"i have made this twice. the first time i let the noodles soak for an hour and they disintergrated in the wok. the second time i soaked the rice noodles for 15 minutes and it made a big difference. this dish has alot of flavor, i added 1/2 lb of raw shrimp as well as the dried. this is a quick, easy meal."
1161157,89204,2012-02-18,5,My family asks for this once a week! I added taco seasoning for a bit more flavor.
600105,24712,2011-01-19,5,Awesome flavor!! The only change I made was to omit the chicken. I am in my first trimester of pregnancy and chicken is not my friend right now. But the soup was great without it. I can't believe how silky smooth the soup is. I used Jasmine rice and organic chicken base instead of the bullion and broth. Great flavors. Even my 2 and 4 year old loved the soup. Thanks for the recipe!!
2001247868,63828,2016-11-15,5,"HOLY MOLY !! This is the easiest and best recipe for pork tenderloin ever! I have tried smoking, grilling, frying and baking and none have yielded such a juicy, tender chunk of meat at the end. I used brown sugar, salt, garlic and onion powder... and in the end, the juice left over was awesome over the mash potatoes I served it with! Definitely will try this again in the future."
428885,412044,2010-10-25,5,"So - this is THE salad of the month!! And how glad I was to try this classic dinner salad - although I confess to having 2 helpings! I added the basil to the dressing as a previous reviewer did - and it was scrumptious!  Had some nice light fresh lettuces - and beautiful tomatoes and lovely red radishes!  Thank you so very much, dear Sharon! Made to honor your dear husband - Sharon's Cook-a-thon - Kk's forum."
39835,193509,2007-03-10,4,Very good fish! I used catfish instead of the haddock increasing the cooking time to adjust for the thicker fish.
118268,7435,2005-06-08,5,"This was GREAT!  My husband, the corned beef lover, wants it this way everytime!  No problem.  It is easy and delicious!  Thanks!"
168896,86275,2005-09-20,5,I cannot believe i made such a delicious rice pudding!  The taste was phenomenal.  The recipe was so simple and it wasnt expensive to make either!  My toddler daughter loved it as well.  We used all organic ingredients; and arborio rice and regular organic sugar as i was out of brown.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!
58210,130386,2006-03-19,5,"This is delicious.  I used blackberry jam since it's what I had on hand, and no hot pepper sauce.  This is absolutely the best!  Thanks a bunch for a terrific, easy, kid-pleasing recipe!"
232669,137732,2007-03-30,5,"Hi Sarah Chana, what a great kugel! I must admit that I made it awhile ago and I just forgot about reviewing it! So very sorry. We have made this twice now and given it to a family when we took them a whole basket of food. I love potatoes and onions any which way. Made the recipe as posted except for the fact that I added black pepper and 1 tablespoon butter and reduced the oil to three tablespoons. Thank you again for posting and for sharing a lovely tadition, Diane :=)"
498271,373092,2010-09-20,5,This is a good drink....almost too good!  Sweet and tropical and goes down so smooth.  Really liked the bubbly soda in this too.  Thanks for posting the recipe!
305531,501151,2013-10-08,5,"Yummy! I read the other reviews about it being a bit wet and cut back on the honey, lime juice and mayo with great results. We enjoyed this for a nice lunch. Thanks westtextazzy for sharing. Made for Football Week 4 2013. Congrats again on another win!"
696631,50684,2007-12-20,5,"AWESOME! I added 1/2 tea. of orange zest and topped some of them with orange buttercream icing - 3c pwd sugar, 3tb OJ, 1-1/2 tea. orange zest, 1/3c butter.

Without the icing, they are heavenly...with the icing they are absolutely decadent!"
126435,24952,2007-09-06,5,"Excellent!  I'll never buy the packaged stuff again! It works great for recipe#52993, or any other recipe that doesn't use an entire envelope. No waste, easy storage, ready to use again! Thanks Millie!"
1160345,95598,2016-02-15,5,The family loved this. I made a couple of changes. No almonds. I&#039;m allergic to tree nuts and gluten intolerant. I used rice krispies for the almonds and gluten free flour for the ap flour. I wasn&#039;t in love with the texture of the corn meal but it had a good crunch and wasn&#039;t bad. The fact that the family loved it will have me saving the recipe AND doing it again.
91897,33770,2005-03-27,5,Excelent! I bought a new waffle iron and tried this recipe with walnuts and a dash of cinnamon. I also ended up using white flour since I was out of WW and it was just fine! Will be making them again
185446,275854,2011-01-28,5,"This is certainly easier to make than traditional lasagna, but just as tasty and filling.  It hit the spot on a cold winter evening.  Thanks, Seasoned Cook."
232031,28439,2007-05-13,5,"This was super easy to make, and tastes so delicious. I made this for a beverage recipe I had (where you add a scoop of the granita to a little tequila and sprite). They were to die for! This also really perks up anything sweet that calls for a lime flavoring. I really recommend this delightful and great recipe. Everyone that tried here loved it (and that includes people who did not add booze!). Thanks!"
366672,66575,2007-05-17,5,"Very nice... actually a delight of a recipe to make and taste. 5 thumbs up for sure!! A little bit on the expensive side for us (especially the blueberries this time of the year) but so well worth the comments of my family of ""gosh.. this is good"" I had some left over whipping cream and put a dollop of that on top of the servings. P.S. I used all the canned fruit reserve - absolutely perfect!! Indeed, the vanilla pudding mix is the key for a lovely ""sauce"" .. Thank you for sharing."
327989,3180,2009-11-19,5,"These are wonderful. I made these and modified them to fit what I had.
I used salted real butter and subbed 1/2 tsp almond extract for the vanilla because I was all out.
After I was done mixing, I turned it out onto wax paper and rolled it into a log. Refrigerated over night, cut into slices and baked at 350 for 6 minutes."
58104,99645,2004-11-20,5,I made a punch bowl of this. I did miss calulate and added to much grenadine so it was a bit sweet. But was still very good! I used fresh squeezed lemons and limes. I didn`t shake and strain as directed I added ice to it in a large bowl. Garnish with fresh orange slices. Thanks Sue!
198154,18286,2012-12-05,4,I had an opened bottle of red wine that I needed to use up.  I made this marinade for some skirt steak DH had in the freezer.  I let them marinate 48 hours and DH cooked them on the grill.  He gave it four stars.
998226,29765,2010-03-17,5,"Wonderful dressing!  Since you liked the dijon, I used a seeded stone ground, this could not have been tastier. I added sliced egg since I had it on hand, I couldn't stop eating this!  Thanks for sharing"
101732,210171,2008-11-13,4,This was a knife and fork sandwich! (My favorite kind!) I used leftover turkey breast from last night's dinner and it worked perfectly. I also used 1 can of chicken broth and 1 cup of turkey broth from last night. I had to sub a can of cream of celery for 1 of the cans of cream of mushroom because all I had was 1 can of mushroom soup. I only gave this 4 stars because I really don't see what the point of the crock pot was. I had it in the crock for 3 hours on low and it was starting to stick to the bottom. It had the same texture as when it was in the skillet. I'll make this again without the crock pot. Thanks so much for posting! Made for My 3 Chefs '08.
653244,394518,2009-11-03,5,"Haven't tried it yet but will tonight!  I make sweet potato fries often but never spiced them up like this................and LOVE avacado so I can't wait to make this dip!
Thanks for the great idea!"
89831,266894,2009-01-25,5,"This is delicious, I didn't have any bow tie pasta so I used elbow macaroni, and I reduced the recipe by half, I also added in 1 teaspoon garlic powder to the mayo mixture and didn't bother to measure the black pepper amount, this only improves in flavor the longer you chill it, great recipe bmc, thanks for sharing!"
221235,271547,2007-12-15,4,"So easy to make and very good too!!  Had everything on hand and liked that it called for oil, so I didn't have wait for butter to warm up. I used my Pampered Chef small scoop and got 52 cookies.  I also used the red & green Nestle swirl chips for a nice Christmas look.  Will add this to my list of Christmas cookies to make every year."
157425,536678,2018-08-18,5,"I have always used boxed mac and cheese but after tasting this one no more boxes! Didnt use the cajun seasoning in the topping and sprinkled it in the macaroni a little at a time until it was perfect for us. Cheese sauce was easy to make, great tasting, and made a nice creamy macaroni and cheese.. Will also be a good cold weather dish. Made and reviewed for Susie D's World Tour."
98722,207432,2007-03-08,4,"These are quite good.  The combination of a cakier bottom brownie plus caramel plus a squidgier top brownie is very nice.  One tip though, don't be a perfectionist and try and get the caramel all the way to the edge of the pan, or it will stick.  Leave a little space and it will be much better. :)"
341170,348440,2010-03-28,5,"I love this kind of cake and was hoping to find a recipe! I used olive oil, cause I do in everything but otherwise made as written. Such a fancy looking cake!"
1028917,151446,2008-11-16,5,This is awesome! I can make enough to feed an army and it will still be gone the same day. My whole family loves this!
37636,277242,2008-05-01,3,"This was certainly fast and easy to prepare but wasn't an outstanding recipe at all. The flavors of the combined gumbo and chowder I think I would rather keep separate, although I think adding the evaporated milk to make it a cream soup is a good idea. Thanks for posting."
28995,266296,2007-12-10,5,LOVED LOVED LOVED this - forgot to put how much butter to add in first step - used 3 TBS - thanks!!!
972785,38631,2010-03-23,5,Thank You Chris !!! Your recipe was a hit with everyone in my family and that is a feat that is not easily done. I made it exactly as written and was very happy with the end results !  I know this will be in my regular cycle of  tried and true recipes ! Thanks again....
457992,67490,2007-07-17,5,"Lovely, flavorful tofu dish! I used smoked tofu so I could skip the pressing. I used ketchup instead of tomato paste, added a dash of nutmeg, and used red wine instead of white. We really enjoyed it, thanks for the recipe!"
305531,463294,2012-01-30,5,Delish! So simple and so tasty. I halved the recipe and used flour tortillas and red enchilada sauce. Thanks Annacia for a great meal. Made for Best of 2011 Tag.
157425,156293,2006-04-06,4,This cole slaw was good but a bit more tangy than we like it. Only made 1/2 recipe and I did refrigerate over night and tossed well before serving. 
564101,83945,2008-07-29,3,"As a life-long potato addict I wasn't overly impressed with these.  I think if I'd added some cheese I would have like them more but they just didn't beat real mashed for me.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, saw me making the cauliflower and still didn't believe me when I told him they weren't potatoes.  I'll try playing around with them a time or two more and see how that goes."
199848,217754,2007-05-25,5,"This has to be one of the easiest potato salads that I've ever made, yet it's super zesty and tasty!  I used reduced-fat mayo, reduced-fat sour cream and the tarragon vinegar.  Not the same old same old.  I'll be making thjis again.  Thanx for posting."
145410,61591,2007-10-29,5,Excellent salad..The dressing is to die for.
125411,34450,2004-09-21,5,"Very tasty..the whole family enjoyed it and the ease of preparation means I'll make it again! I didn't have chili oil, so I used a few drops of hot sauce but will increase that next time. Thanks for a great entree idea."
324390,252241,2007-10-09,5,"Not only does this look like an asteroid pop, it tastes like one too. This was very easy to layer. Nice and sweet!"
539686,487985,2013-08-16,5,"Easy to put together and packed with flavor...made for ZWT #9, this dish is a keeper!"
222478,222332,2008-01-04,5,Really wonderful creamy sauce. The anchovy flavour is in no way overpowering so I think it would also be loved by a lot of people not really into anchovies. I prepared in advance and after tasting it refrigerated decided to serve it that way because it was a warm night and it was superb over some lamb noisettes. It was also really suited some cooked and salad vegetables as a dressing so we ended up using almost the whole amount for a meal for two.
203823,142860,2005-12-22,5,"My 3 year old daughter and I made these for breakfast.  We used whole wheat flour, old-fashioned oats, and multigrain Cheerios.  I also added 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips just for fun.  Next time I will use a little less Cheerios since they had a hard time sticking together.  We got 16 large cookies and I think I will make them a little smaller next time because they crumble easily.  They taste just like eating a bowl of cheerios for breakfast and I may like them a little better without the raisins next time.  My daughter ate one and asked for more so 5 stars from us!      "
169969,130785,2006-07-22,5,"Delicious! I usually use the freshest salmon available for salmon cakes, but this time I used a can of Wild Alaskan King Salmon. I was not disappointed. I did not add the seasoning salt and I used the egg whites that I had leftover from another recipe instead of a whole egg. The patties were easy to handle, firm, and had a great texture. I also used package cornflake crumbs that were already pulverized. I placed the cakes in hot oil and flipped them once. Easy as one, two, three! The sauce is a great pairing and I can see why you snagged the recipe and included it! I used homemade mayo in the sauce... ohhh sooo good! I served the salmon cakes with Emeril Lagasse's Coleslaw and Baked Potatoes With Shallot-Corn Butter (both recipes on Zaar). Thank you Pottsie! Outstanding Salmon Cakes and a perfect dinner!"
1691685,81355,2011-01-06,4,"Made this recipe tonight, it was quick and easy, and best of all i didn't have to run out and buy a bunch of ingredients, i had everything on hand.  Well almost everything, we didn't have any Coke, so i substituted Dr. Pepper instead.  It seemed fine.  Great recipe, i'll probably never buy Manwich again!!!!"
442014,261634,2010-01-06,4,These taste great! Make sure to follow the directions a little bit better. I forgot to season the meat before placing in the flour.
162826,122030,2007-08-27,5,"This potato salad is fantastic... love the crunchiness & the addded flavor of the Parmesan. I did take a previous reviewer's suggestion and added some low-fat sour cream to the dressing for a ""snap""...
This is guest-worthy for a BBQ. Made for Derf's Cook-a-Thon."
415934,79526,2008-09-23,4,"The flavor of these were good with the onions.  The making of them -- not so good.  I must have done something wrong -- maybe not grated finely enough, but the actual making of the tator tots wasn't pretty.  They kept disintegrating on me in the hot oil.   I tried both in a pan on the stove and in the deep fryer.  So I ended up turning them into fritters and they were yummy.  Sorry.  I can't figure out what I did wrong, but I can't imagine the problem was with the directions so it must have been me.  The taste was good once I turned them into fritters, though."
311203,81564,2006-06-10,5,This was excellent.  I made it as written except I also rinsed the sauerkraut just after draining it (which I always do because I like a milder flavor with less salt).  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will make this again.
96796,423116,2012-07-07,5,"Finally, I can eat french toast again!  This is a really tasty and EASY recipe.  I used vanilla almond milk instead of the other milks and vanilla.  It made it that much easier.  A half recipe was more than enough for 3 slices of bread.  Thanks for a recipe that my entire family loves! :-)"
1800040750,200577,2013-09-01,1,This is definitely not the Chuy&#039;s recipe. We did a side by side taste test with some to-go creamy jalape&ntilde;o salsa and the one we made from this recipe. NOT even close. Gonna keep hoping someone figures it out but this isn&#039;t it.
2001407734,180964,2017-08-04,0,"Ended up being very dense, and it fell when I brushed water onto it. Not sure if I'll try this one again or not. The flavor is t bad though"
133174,170166,2006-06-20,5,This salad is a wonderful dish for lunch or a light dinner.  I prepared it for lunch and served it on top of torn romain with crackers.  The salmon was the salmon that comes in the pouch but would be great if you had leftovers to break up and mix in.  I do think this would be wonderful with the addition of some fresh dill.  Maybe next time.  Thanks Sharon for a great lunch.
149415,20387,2007-12-24,5,"Yummy, yummy, yummy. I actually left out the nuts, because I was making for kids that don't like nuts, These are rich and gooey and very good."
647181,111777,2009-11-15,5,"This is the first time I have attempted to make chicken pot pie.  It was very easy and so delicious!I didn't wait for it to settle so it was a little runny when I cut into it, but that didn't really bother me.  The leftovers were just as good!"
414166,105830,2008-04-20,5,Excellent and Tasty! These popovers were so easy to make and tasted great.  I will be making these again and again. Thanks!
165623,238347,2007-07-25,4,"I made a few changes so that I could take this to work with me. Instead of bananas on sticks, I sliced the bananas. So I ended up dipping the slices in the peanut butter mixture then rolling it in the granola. It was really yummy and kinda fun when the peanut butter was warm, but then the pb started to harden and it wasn't as easy. This wouldn't be an issue if I had followed the directions. Anyway it was really good and I think kids would totally dig it. I will make this again and will try different items to roll it in, such as rice crispies, corn flakes etc."
4740,49833,2004-08-11,5,These are truly the best when it comes to comfort food.  The only things I do differently are that I use cubes of bread instead of crumbs and I add 3/4 tsp browning sauce to the soup/water gravy combination.  Your stomach will definitely get filled up with these.
889489,150863,2009-04-12,5,I have been wanting to make this recipe for quite a while.  Finally made as a meatless dinner for Good Friday.  Doubled recipe for leftovers.  They reheated very well.  Easy and good.
2002199158,272815,2018-06-26,4,"I made the recipe in bread machine on basic bread setting, medium crust doneness setting. The crust was too thick/hard for my familyâs liking. I reduced the coffee to 1 1/2tsp &amp; added 1TBSP sugar per recommendations of other comments. Next time I want to try blooming my yeast first (I bought âbread maker yeastâ &amp; it said you didnât have to). Also my 6yo said it was great minus the extra âcrusty crustâ but she wanted to try the little loaves like the restaurant next time. This is our first attempt using our new bread machine and the reason for purchasing it. I wish there was a complete recipe with how to make it in the machine so I didnât have to guess. However for our first time, we think it is great! Where can I get caramel color?"
265559,155458,2006-04-25,4,This dish was easy to prepare.  The pork chops were nice and tender.  Gravy was tastey but needed thickening.  Overall....a keeper!! 
199848,11293,2007-12-04,5,"I love savory (as opposed to sweet) yam and squash casseroles, so I had to make this!  I had about 3 cups of butternut squash puree in my freezer, so I mashed 3 cups of yams.  The recipe easily triples, but I only used 1/2 cup of butter instead of 3/4 cup.  I tripled everything else, though.  Yes, this is excellent with chicken and I'm sure other meats as well.  I'll make this again.... it's a great change from regular old mashed potatoes.  Thanx Bergy!"
962690,47062,2009-05-17,5,"I have never cooked lamb or hollandaise and these both turned out excellent.
I used New Zealand lamb.
I did not eat any since I don't like lamb but my DH and our guest was majorly impressed.
I didn't find the sauce very minty so would add a bit more I think.
Made for the Aus/NZ region for ZWT 5 for team Zaar Chow Hounds"
55578,108524,2008-10-17,5,Absolutely delish.  The cake just keeps getting better and better each day.
53586,25625,2003-09-25,3,"Well, I did actually try this out of morbid curiosity ;-)! It's not bad.  Now I should let you know that I'm pregnant, so my tastes might be a little skewed, but really the tomato seems more like a fruit when served with sweet stuff.  I added apricot preserves to my sandwich, and really rather enjoyed it.  I may be back after my pregnancy cravings wear off to renounce this post, but for now it's definitely edible, and sometimes the only thing I want if nothing else sounds good.  My midwife says it's a nice healthy snack to eat when your pregnant, so there you go."
2001695335,116152,2017-08-31,4,Wonderful and easy breakfast with few dishes to clean or tentativeness. The only tricky part is getting the egg to the right doneness if you're not scrambling them.
67656,178608,2007-09-27,5,"These were so easy to prepare and perfectly delicious.  While preparing these, I was a bit concerned about the amount of paprika and felt it would overwhelm the other flavors but that was not the case.  The flavors were clean and simple and worked so nicely with the creaminess of my golden Yukon gold potatoes.  Served this with pork tenderloin and steamed broccoli.  Thanks!"
553862,395984,2009-10-29,5,"A big hit for a quick dinner on a busy weeknight.  This one definitely goes into my arsenal of regular recipes.    I doubled the recipe and all the left overs were gobbled up for lunches.   I used regular, uncooked rice, and let it simmer awhile longer, and I did add extra liquid along the way.  Thanks for posting"
334628,218059,2007-05-29,5,"Mandy, I am giving this 5 stars, this was a very tasty appetizer, I made this tonight after reading my Zaar emails. It took no time at all to make or to eat. I am making a 2nd batch so I can take it to work with me tomorrow. I am adding a slice of tomatoes on top of one of the slices to see what that will taste like. This will be my lunch for tomorrow. Thanks for posting. 5/28/7 Happy Memorial Day to you and yours. Melody A. - Lansing, Illinois"
236959,14086,2006-06-12,3,"Very easy to make, but a little plain and the taste wasn't exceptional, just ok. The sauce was too much for the fresh asparagus spears and kind of drowned out the taste of them. Not bad, but I won't be making it again.  "
199792,200452,2008-02-04,5,"Yum, Yum, Yum!! This is a quick and wonderful dinner. I served it with rice and asparagus. I did overcook the shrimp a bit but that was my fault and not the fault of the recipe. I would, however, caution you to watch them. I have put all the leftovers into a little container to take to work -- a rice bowl works for me. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe."
152251,123813,2010-01-06,5,Great recipe! next time I'll try with rosemary--it should be heavenly.
76273,13214,2003-12-16,5,"Forgot to sign my review.....

Vancouver, Canada"
67243,96988,2007-10-20,5,Fantastic!! My husband ate like a pig. I did't think he would even like it. I used leftovers in chicken crescent rolls. YUMMY! I had a 5lb. chicken and cooked on high for about 5 hr.
741591,47953,2008-01-26,5,The aroma was very enticing.  The final product ...very morish! I substituted strawberry yogurt for the milk and used a combination of blueberries and raspberries.  Definitely will keep this one - may try to use brandied peaches instead of berries next time.
12118,16267,2002-03-26,5,"Very good. I added a bit of celery too.  Had a really good and differnt taste compared to your usual chicken noodle, kind of like the gourmet version.  Great when you are sick too."
117927,443305,2011-12-02,5,"This recipe is spectacular!  I've tried to leave a rating 3 times, but no success!"
242729,41996,2007-07-31,5,"Excellent! I made this about a week ago, and we ate it when we barbequed over the weekend; I agree, it is better than the sickly sweet stuff.....I did not have any green onions handy, so I used a little chopped shallots. Spicy, tangy and perfect with grilled meats! Thanks Mirj! FT:-)"
246266,53081,2007-09-25,5,"I've made this once before exactly as written, and it is wonderful.  I'm currently not allowed dairy in my diet, so I tried this again this morning using Silk soymilk and Smart Balance Light (in place of the butter).  I really didn't expect it to turn out so well without using the dairy ingredients, but I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome.  Very good!"
185387,194109,2007-01-13,5,"I made this for lunch today because the weather is getting cold. What a find. I love tomato soup and this had such a nice kick with the hot sauce and I loved the way the beef broth gave it a different flavor. Thank you annacia for a new wonderful soup that I will make over and over.. Wonderful, easy soup.. :)"
866747,66460,2009-05-03,5,"Delicious!!!! This was very good for a low fat, low cal snack. I made about 7 large muffins."
2775470,39087,2013-04-08,5,The whole family loves this! It will be a regular on the dinner menu for us and I wouldn&#039;t change a thing
624854,19915,2008-03-20,4,"This is one of mine & my husband's favorite soups! Very healthy, as lentils are one of the best sources of fiber and protein. We make it with fresh homemade bread for a cozy meal on a cold day. It is so simple to make that I've shared it with a few of my friends.
Thanks for posting it!"
1220686,278806,2014-10-16,5,"I am so glad I found this recipe.  I adjusted it a bit so I could use regular bran that you buy in bulk instead of the cereal- cheaper and healthier.  I used 1/2 c milk and 2 c regular bran.  I&#039;m not an artificial sweetener user, so I just used 1/2 c sugar, plus I used 1/2 c semi sweet chocolate chips (you couldn&#039;t even taste the 2T of mini ones)  and white whole wheat flour. I also did regular-sized muffins, baking for the same time.&lt;br/&gt;Great recipe. I love the pumpkin for some added nutrients.  Tastes like dessert!"
1644565,146246,2014-07-30,1,"This is terrible.  No flavor, bland.  Yuck."
59163,122379,2009-05-23,4,"A quick and easy recipe.  I used red and yellow peppers since I had them on hand.  I marinated the chicken for about an hour first.  We really enjoyed these and doubled the recipe for leftovers the next day.  The only thing I would change would be to use fresh pineapple instead of canned. Will be making these again during our summer grilling season, thanks!"
37449,19704,2004-12-02,5,This made a nice dinner for my DH and DD! They really liked the taste and want it again! Thanks dcmac!
2000354261,168634,2015-07-21,4,the best GF banana bread i ever made.  I substituted ground flax for xanthan gum you use 1 tsp of ground flax ( i had a bag on hand) add about a tsp of boiling water and it makes a paste that you add to the recipe instead of the xanthan gum.  I also did not want to turn the oven on because its summer so i used my toaster oven and it worked! 45 min in a glass loaf pan it was perfect!.  this one will be my new go to recipe!!
146187,172050,2006-07-17,4,Made this over the week end and it was fantastic! It made a HUGE amount.  It could easily serve 6-10 people. It was even better the next day. Only change made was we added kalamata olives to the salad. Thanks for sharing Homegirl!  
590701,382072,2010-11-24,5,"If you haven't tried it, you should =)  I love sweet potatoes but don't always know what to do with them.  This is great!  I love the combination from the bacon, honey, and vinegar.  Great as is!"
79142,55519,2003-07-20,5,"My family really liked this one--though I had to alter it in favor of on-hand ingredients.

I replaced the andouille with smoked sausage, the flour tortillas with corn tortillas, the celery with mushrooms, and the paprika with chili powder and cayenne to taste.

It came out smooth and rich, with a nice mellow flavor that worked well with the corn tortillas."
33159,128749,2006-07-19,4,This was a very good recipe!  The meat was cooked beautifully.  We just expected the flavour to be a little spicier.  I agree with Bobtail - cooking in the foil made clean-up a breeze!!
1346217,227127,2012-01-21,5,"I love this recipe.  The sauce is divine.  I have made this many times, and everyone always loves it. I use about half the package of dry ranch dressing mix, but it is not too salty even using the whole package.  <br/>You can also add some chopped onion, a sliced carrot or two, a touch of minced garlic, a couple fresh mushrooms and a dash of red pepper flakes if you wish.  I have even substituted the potatoes with turnips or rutabagas.  The supreme sauce loves experimentation.<br/>Thanks you, Heather.  This is a definite keeper."
543029,17475,2007-07-28,4,I used to eat a very similar recipe for breakfast. My only changes were that I used to broil/microwave the combination so the cheese would melt a bit and then I'd usually skip the sugar. A classic!
37449,105454,2005-11-06,5,So easy and  makes a great snack!
497077,178833,2008-10-22,5,"DELICIOUS! Since we drink tea most everyday, I am always on the lookout for ways to jazz it up and this fits the bill perfectly. I made my own grenadine to have on hand and I use limes or lemons. Thank you, Sharon123, for a great recipe! Made for the Think Pink Tag Game In Honor of Breast Cancer Awareness, October 2008."
2001254489,119761,2016-12-12,5,"Made this two ways as I needed more than one. Made this recipe exactly as described and it was terrific. Then, I switched up the frosting, and instead of using the lemon rind I omitted it, frosted the bars and topped them with cinnamon sugar! Both were great! The one with cinnamon sugar was perfect as a festive dessert for Thanksgiving. Very pretty! Thanks so much for this great recipe! It's a hit..."
155469,58263,2005-01-07,3,I was looking around for a yam recipe that would be similar to the way I remember my Dad's version.  This looked pretty close and it was good.  My only recommendation would be to thicken the syrup.  I think my Dad used to add cornstarch.  I'm going to give that try next time I make these.
27443,309276,2008-08-21,5,"Made Lots O' Apple Cake
Recipe #183288 and glazed it with your yummy glaze, a great combination. Thanks for sharing"
108460,129926,2010-12-14,5,"Excellent!  My husband loved it, as well as the rest of my family.  Delicious; and I did add a little cumin and garlic to the chicken and onions, and I ended up using only five tortillas because we like to really stuff ours.  Other than that everything else was the same.  So good!"
474840,88880,2007-05-12,5,Great and so easy!
2001501054,16465,2017-04-22,5,"I have to confess I used my own recipe in a slow cooker first. And mine turned out lousy! I followed the ratio of rice and water here. and I stirred my rice every 30 minutes. By the second hour, my rice started to dry. And by the 2 hour and a half mark, my rice was perfectly done! I don't add butter. I added 2 spoonfuls of cooking oil and minced garlic cloves. This ratio is perfect and I won't change a thing!"
1231233,357354,2009-05-03,4,"I love this cake! it's great, i always make it when i have the munchies, the first time I tried it it came out a bit weird but you just have to watch it and maybe take it out for a few seconds to compensate for the heat of a too powerful microwave"
199848,106666,2013-01-09,5,"I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  I knew it would be good, but my husband really raved over this.  I made this as written, but cut the amount of butter in half and used 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  It was nice and creamy and had a great flavor.  I served this over corkscrew pasta.  This will be one of my go-to crockpot recipes.  Thanx!"
35526,54379,2005-08-23,5,This was simply delicious.  I had a 3.5 pound pork roast.  Cooked ofr about 5 hours and it was still very juicy and just bursting with flavor.  The crust was perfect.  I did leave the wine out and we didn't miss it.    
68884,151292,2006-11-23,4,"I made these to take to Thanksgiving at my MIL's, using a spicy mustard and sprinkling with a bit of paprika. I didn't even get one - so I'm basing my review on DH's thoughts (he loves deviled eggs). He thought they were very good but could've used additional ""spice"" of some sort. This is a good basic recipe, with the perfect amount of mayo to give it creaminess but not be too much."
63098,292483,2009-03-17,4,"very good and very close to the original since this comes from Todd wilbur it has to be close right! The one change I make is reducing the salt by half which is still a stgrong salt flavor but just so that someone concerened with salt intake knows that you can get away with 1/4 of the salt called for and not risk any flavor loss. thanks for sharing such a close cousin of the original so we can get our ""fix"" taken care of from home!"
13029,4344,2002-11-06,5,A wonderful recipe! Can't believe I haven't rated this yet - it was the first recipe I tried from 'Zaar. The red pepper flakes really make this. Be careful - it's so addictive. I love to eat it with Triscuits and raw veggies.
373552,105670,2008-04-02,5,"I love these!  I took  advice of others and mixed the ingredients including cooking the bacon beforehand. I also cut the bacon in small pieces.  Then I  mixed everything together in a bowl after allowing the cream cheese to soften.  I also precooked the peppers ever-gently and cut them in half. I stuffed the peppers and cooked them in the oven.  They turned out great. I made tons for an upcoming party. I experimented with a small batch first to see if they would freeze and cook later, they cooked beautifully.  A great make ahead party appetizer--thanks for posting it."
274826,76360,2005-12-18,5,"Being from PA, melting pot of backgrounds that it is, I have enjoyed Halushki most of my life.  The above recipe is about perfect.  I jazz mine up w/a bit of soy sauce and also add some olive oil to the cabbage & onions once they have sauteed in the butter.  Play with this recipe and make it your own.  It's a terrific dish!"
1034569,225324,2011-02-07,0,This was really yummy and moist. I added sprinkles to give it a more festive look. Will definitely make it again.
1800269591,26849,2013-11-18,5,Great cookies everybody loved them quick and easy to make .
2136802,257276,2012-01-21,0,This was so yummy!! It will become a staple in our house.  Thank you so much!
689540,97122,2009-02-18,0,"Well, I tried to use EggBeaters which were frozen and defrosted and what a soupy mess I had.  I couldn't even bake them because it was just liquid.  I am sure it was the EggBeaters because Ina does not make ugly food soooooo, I will rate the recipe after I re-make it with fresh egg whites and another bag of coconut!   Arrrggghhhh! This was my first EggBeater attempt!  :("
1280189,101631,2012-01-15,5,Excellent.  Very tasty and moist for a low fat muffin!  I used all whole wheat flour and they still turned out great.  Thanks for the great recipe.
388414,150863,2008-01-26,5,"Sauted 3 sliced carrots, 2 cup of broccoli, along with 1 small yellow onion (instead of the minced onion) before adding in the broth (I use Chicken Base) and I assumed the ground red pepper was cayenne pepper, which I halved because my oldest son is a spice whiney.. Added in all the extra veggies to sneak em' pass my boys.. ;) Topped with REAL bacon bits.. This was serious lick the bottom of the bowl good.. Thanks for the post.. :)"
193516,170184,2007-06-16,5,"This is a great, refreshing smoothie.  I scaled down the servings to one and enjoyed it as part of my breakfast.  I used non fat sugar free vanilla yogurt. The smoothie turned out a little too thick, so I added a couple more tbsp of yogurt. What an intersting but yummy flavour combo!"
452940,453637,2011-06-24,5,I spread this over hot off the grill rib-eyes to give them a nice butter flavor and it turned out wonderfully. Spicing up butter is always a winner. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
236742,93802,2006-09-18,5,"I am orignally from nortern bama, and I have had these only once in my life, and I am glad that I found this recipe.I made it for labor day get together and people were initally put-off by it some but when they tried it they was in heaven. This is all I remember it was. THANK YOU FOR POSTING"
129201,121987,2006-04-30,5,"This was an excellent roast, Stardustannie, very tender and the juices did make an excellent gravy. After an hour in the oven I ended up poking a couple of holes in the bag, I was so worried it was going to explode. 
I used a 1.9kg bolar roast and cooked it for 2 hours at 200C.  Served with Jewelies Smashed Potatoes,peas,carrots and corn on the cob.
Delicious and easy!!"
383346,192896,2008-02-03,5,I don't eat grilled cheese very often.  It's been a few years since I have not eat this LOL  This one is really good.  Very easy.  Thanks V :)  Made for Beverage tag.
1278514,187362,2012-01-10,5,Yummmmmmmmm. My boyfriend doesn't normally care for pancakes so I have to wheedle at him when I want to have them for breakfast (one person can't eat so many pancakes alone!). On a whim I whipped these up with some leftovers pumpkin and he loved them!
2717385,277704,2013-03-01,0,"Thanks, really enjoyed your recipe and it was very easy to make.  :)"
808027,350894,2009-03-02,5,"Easy and tasty.  I added a healthy shake of dried basil as I love that flavor in my tomato soup.   LOVE your recipes, Kittencal.  Thanks for posting so many great ones.  I'll never have enough time to try all the ones I want to try...but don't let that stop you from adding new ones!!!  :-)"
13483,122786,2005-09-27,5,My stock for this was the liquid found in canned veggies.  I save it and freeze then use it for stock.  Very tasty.  I loved it with this recipe.  I did not add the barley but the soup was terrific without it!!  Thanks Dancer^.
640199,48289,2009-01-27,5,great sauce!  we butterflied a whole bunch of tiger prawns and basted with this sauce while broiling - fabulous!
109110,48760,2007-11-20,5,"Very good, has become a regular at our house.  I cut the sesame seed oil in half to suit our tastes."
98867,61038,2004-02-28,5,"This was gone in about an hour - I'm glad I bought an extra bottle of wine! I had to make a second batch! I had apricot brandy instead of peach. I think I'll cut down on the sugar next time, but that's my prefrence. Everyone else LOVED it."
2000894756,77585,2018-03-14,5,My husband doesn't even like soup and he hates beans. He went back for seconds of this recipe! I used two cans of broth instead one can and 1.5 cups of water. Next time we are going to try with cooked tortellini instead of shell noodles.
1027870,12316,2009-03-12,5,"Excellent taste, easy to make and not time consuming.  The seasoning blend that another reviewer posted was perfect for seasoning the flour.  This recipe is a keeper."
2087541,20184,2012-09-28,0,"Call it a ""Granola Bar"" if it makes you feel better about consuming it, but this is really just a chocolate chip-oatmeal cookie in bar form.  It's a great recipe and really tasty, especially with the addition of the Rice Krispies, but it would definitely benefit from some healthful tweaks, like others have done, using whole wheat flour, less sugar, less butter, using mini choc. chips (and less of them), etc.  It's really a good recipe and one I'll make again but not for fulfilling my family's craving for a ""healthy snack."""
258528,28768,2009-04-13,5,This is absolutely the best lasagna!! I used all sausage and added an extra egg to the cottage cheese mixture. Baked it almost an hour because we made it the night before. It set up quickly and we were able to cut perfect pieces. Everyone raved about it. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us.
107583,89048,2008-10-19,5,"Great breakfast.  Not too filling.  I used parmesan but will try it with Fontina next time I can afford it! :)

I cut the ""baking"" time down to about 10 minutes.  Made for Fall 2008 PAC."
1205987,78048,2014-03-19,5,"I made these this evening and it was my first time making Biscotti.  I followed the recipe exactly except, I cooked them the second time for an extra 10 minutes on each side. I also used a teaspoon of pure anise extract because I didn&#039;t have the oil. I am going to dip the bottoms in semi sweet chocolate tomorrow, if there are any left! Thank you for the great recipe! They are amazing."
907991,316226,2008-07-30,5,What a fantasic cookie...I should know I've been baking them for 50 years and my grandchildren love them just like I did when my grandma made them for me. The best of the best cookie.
124416,31629,2010-12-12,5,"Yes, these cookies are from a Pillsbury Bake-off cookbook.  From the 50's.  And yes, I have been baking them since then!  Excellent!  And easy.   Janet"
900992,48636,2010-02-14,4,Very tasty. Thanks for posting!
192581,83524,2007-08-09,5,"I love cabbage, it's so good for you because it's got lots of vitamin C.  With some carrots in it, that's an excellent dose of vitamin A & C!  Since I like to make a point of having both vitamins in my veggies, I used a cabbage and carrot slaw mix for this recipe.  Very simple, and very delicious.  I wasn't feeling too decadent, so I added a bit less butter, and included 3 leftover scallions.  Such a simple and easy recipe, and it tasted great!  I made this on a very hot summer evening, paired with a simple tomato sandwich for a very lite supper.  Thanks!"
315565,207034,2007-06-30,5,My 15 yr old DD and her skinny dancing friends ate these hot from the oven after rehearsing in our lounge and only left 2 on the oven tray !! I added choc chips !! Very easy to do in the food processor so thanks Tisme.
64625,5343,2007-10-07,5,"A lovely loaf (couldn't wait a day to sample!)with rich date flavour and undertones of orange. It's no butter, no milk, low sugar, and lends itself to various sizes of baking dishes. Made 2 medium sized loaves in 50 minutes of baking. Hearty and comforting autumn fare. No fuss recipe, well presented, easy to follow.  Thanks, Dancer!"
28087,455832,2011-06-26,5,"This is a filling flavorful Strata. I made as written with a couple of changes, I only used 1/2 cup chopped green onions and 2 cups of cubed Recipe #458056. Thanks for a great recipe. Made for ZWT7 Golden Gourmets."

169430,86942,2007-03-20,4,"DH loved this! but then I took a lead from mama and used cranberry juice (for the same reason she did). I think I would leave the lemon juice out next time as the wine, lemon juice and cranberry mix was a bit more acidic than I would have preferred, personal taste only. DH had two helpings which is something he hardly ever does. The only thing I did differently was to brown the meat and then put it in the crockpot for about 8 hrs instead of the oven."
165217,448966,2011-03-22,0,"This recipe was created by Todd Wilbur for his book entitled ""The Best Of Top Secret Recipes"" (Penguin/Putnam 2003)"
280271,291125,2010-01-29,5,What a very delicious dish. I made as posted but cut it in half. We just loved it. It had a burst of heat with the first bite and after that your taste buds get used to the heat. DH added a touch of shredded romaine lettuce and sliced cherry tomatoes to his. I broke my grill out for the year with this recipe. Thanks for getting me back in the mood. And thanks for posting this. :)
17803,98981,2005-08-01,5,"These were so easy to make that after the first pan was baked I made a second batch right way.  We took some to church, I made a plate up to take some friends, his wife is very ill and we have been enjoying some here at home.  I put everything but the chocolate chips in the mixer bowl and stirred the chips in by hand.  So if you find out you have guest coming at the last minute this is outrageously fast to make.  "
341170,333917,2009-07-05,5,"Now that's something different! The local grocery store had a great special on cherries and I'm so glad I picked up 2 big bags! I'm gonna freeze them in 1 1/2 cup servings so I can make this more! I may add more cinnamon as we are big fans, but it's great the way it is too!"
186979,416720,2010-04-11,5,"With no photo as guidance I took things into my own hands and made these wee cupcakes to look as close to Butterflies as possible. Cake recipe is wonderful but I used this recipe, Recipe #406410, for the filling. Raspberries were the right size so they got used rather than the GIANT strawberries my market sells. Made these for dessert (pudding) on a fine Spring Day and the family delighted in them. My DH and children are British so Fairy Cakes and Butterfly cakes are held dear to their hearts. Made for Spring PAC 2010."
659630,221541,2007-11-20,5,This was very delicious!  It was a perfect addition to a Healthy-ish Fall Comfort Food theme dinner that I had w/ a couple of girlfriends (although my husband managed to show up just in time for our dinner - and he really loved this too!)  Only change I did was minor - I used regular brandy b/c that's what I had....  It was fabulous.  It's perfectly perfect for a main dish salad - and I think that's how I'll use it again.  The salad was pretty typical - but w/ craisins in it and a vinaigrette and it all just went so nicely together!  We also had it w/ a soup and Irish soda bread.  A perfect meal helped along by this wonderful and super easy dish! It's a keeper! Many thanks!
42217,62708,2005-08-25,5,"I made this the day before and I thought for sure the ginger would be too strong, but it wasn't.  I doubled it and it is a great sauce.  I used it with #98345 potstickers.  Keeper!"
583349,428627,2010-06-14,4,"Enjoying this for lunch this week.  Love the pistachios, apricots, and mint in this!  I felt that the cumin was a bit strong and the cinnamon not strong enough, so next time I will play around with it and probably use ground cinnamon instead of cinnamon sticks.  Also, I would cook the couscous in chicken broth instead of water to up the flavor even more.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for ZWT6."
447742,62513,2009-01-10,5,"I changed this up, just a little bit, but this was very tasty, and makes a ton!  First, I cooked maybe a pound of chicken breasts in a little olive oil and sprinkled with Recipe #38293.  Sliced into bite sized pieces then set aside.  Followed the rest of the recipe, but didn't use any butter.  I also used 2-15 oz. cans diced tomatoes, undrained, in place of the roma tomatotes.  Added the chicken in the spinach tomato mixture just before tossing with the pasta.  This is one I'll be making again. :)"
2000949191,383631,2017-07-18,0,The calorie content seems very high for one serving. Not for someone trying to watch their diet.
446143,377581,2009-07-05,4,Used smoked turkey breast in place of ham.
560491,143995,2011-03-08,4,Made this for an easy lunch.  I like that there is not a heavy cream sauce like some primavera recipes.  I used packaged diced ham and followed the recipe as written.  Made for Everyday Holiday.
666723,193831,2008-04-03,5,"These were pretty easy to put together for me.  I used fresh basil.  Before I put the fresh basil and potatoes together, I drizzled some olive oil on all the slices and sprinkled with salt, pepper, and some dried basil for lots of extra flavor.  I had chicken in the oven at 400, so I did these at 400 for 30 minutes and they were semi crispy which was exactly perfect for us.  Can't wait to try with cilantro!"
1211153,234213,2010-08-20,2,"I tried it and while it wasn't inedible it isn't worth making again.  The quinoa and flour mixture cooked immediately and became an extremely thick mass and I couldn't mix in the onions and spinach.  I used less spinach than called for and used a small eggplant and still the mixture overflowed the 9"" loaf pan.  The flavour was insipid.  It was filling and nutritious and easy to make."
1010380,323289,2008-11-01,5,10 stars again Trinkets! Right on! This was perfect with your roasted chicken
1125517,15870,2009-12-13,5,This was a big hit at my mom's group dinner! I love lettuce wraps and this recipe did not disappoint! The chicken mix and all the sauces were great. It's probably my new favorite! Thank you for posting!
1800305659,69983,2015-10-10,2,"I&#039;m really disappointed. I don&#039;t know what I did wrong. I followed all directions (just added more spice because I like it) and it came out very heavy and pumpkin pie like, not cake like at all. Too eggy for me."
103876,19710,2004-08-14,5,This turned out great!  I used less butter and a little less parmesan cheese and was really pleased with the results.  Easy to make too.  Thanks for a new way to serve cauliflower.
68928,74532,2003-11-05,5,I loved these!  They were easy to put together and baked pretty quick in the oven.  I'll definitely be making these again!
513848,244768,2007-08-17,5,this was good we enjoyed it
88585,34382,2006-07-20,5,"Mizz Nezz you did it again. Another winning recipe. made this last night and my family loved them . Thanks for a winning recipe, this is a keeeper."
29014,74224,2003-12-01,4,"This is a good filling soup for a cold day.  The seasonings are tasty but not spicy.  The only change I made was to add a pound of browned ground beef to the recipe (DH won't go ""meatless"").  I left this in the crockpot all day so supper was ready when we were."
307214,49990,2006-08-17,4,This is really good.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of yogurt because it looked like it was needed.  Also I forgot to add the spices to the blueeberries.(oops)  Excellent recipe to end a brunch.  Will make again and again.  Thanks.
577934,297251,2009-06-22,0,I was quite happy with your sauce.  I had bought some Yumm! sauce the day before so I had it on hand to test taste.  I did add abot another 1/4 cup lemon juice to get it closer to the Yumm! taste.  Good Job!!!  Jude
2002317255,47851,2018-10-30,0,You canNOT bake this loaf in a 375 oven for 1 hour: it will be incinerated. Half hour in a 350 oven is plenty. And do NOT drain the salmon -- the whole thing will be too dry.
2002286950,258844,2018-09-28,0,"1/2 tsp. of Tabasco is way too much! Would start with a few drops next time. Yummy soup, though, just too hot peppery."
1173262,12921,2009-12-01,4,"Sooo good! I marinated my chicken thighs in the Italian dressing and just used tongs to drag it through the bread crumbs.  I didn't have Italian bread crumbs with cheese, so I just used some grated parm. and mixed it in.  I, too, had problems with sogginess, so I just put a cooling rack on a baking sheet, turned the chicken over (soggy side up) on it and baked it for 10 more minutes to get it crispy.  Turned out beautiful...even had to laugh as the DH snuck downstairs later to grab seconds. Thanks!"
1500146,104014,2010-03-19,5,"Very good! The BF LOVED them! I thought there wouldn't be enough sauce, but there was plenty. Makes a huge serving. I did, however, have to add another cup of bread crumbs so they would stick."
538312,161908,2007-08-16,5,These pinwheels are the best!! I took them for a potluck at work and everyone loved them!! I will most certainly make these again! Thanks for the recipe!
319738,94296,2007-05-13,4,The flavor was excellent!  This 4 stars instead of 5 because I had to add extra liquid to cover the bread.  (This may be my fault as I couldn't find the stuffing and had to use a 1 lb loaf of french bread.)  I added an extra cup of milk and 4 egg whites and a little extra mustard.  Definitely a keeper!  One of the easiest stratas I have made and one of the best!  Thank you!
885058,10481,2008-08-22,5,"WOW!  This has always been one of my favorites.  However, I've never tried making it myslef.  I could eat it all by myself!...but I won't. :)  I cut the recipe down to 3-4 servings as I am really the only one in my house who eats fresh broccoli.  I love this after it sits and chills in the refrigerator for a few hours.  The tastes really mix together, and it's fabulous!  I also used Splenda instead of sugar.  For mayo, I used the Smart Balance mayo.  Turkey bacon is a great substitute for the real bacon.  This is a wonderfully delicious and healthy meal or side dish.  Thanks for the recipe."
225541,65051,2005-08-03,5,"Wonderful, rich muffin!I didn't have all the molasses so I used some honey (about 1/4th cup) and used 1/4th tsp nutmeg and 1/4th tsp cloves in place of the ginger.I will make these again.
"
657246,327922,2010-05-06,5,"We have finally found our pancake recipe.  After trying lots of recipes, this is the one voted best by our family.  I can't say whether they taste like CB b/c I used white wheat flour, raw sweet cream buttermilk, and brown sugar to make.  These cooked to a perfect golden brown and puffed up beautifully.  I served them with homemade butter and local honey.  DH, who swears he will only eat maple syrup on his pancakes, loved these with the honey on them.  Thanks for sharing a winning recipe!"
134011,185453,2006-10-06,5,"Yes I agree, these are devine.  The texture was perfect.  Much better than the wheat-bix versions that I have used for rum balls previously.  I had to make a small substitution - Cointreau liquer instead of rum as that is all we had at hand....the flavour worked well with this recipe. Thanks for sharing"
814478,28880,2008-09-29,5,"We added some nutmeg, and we had to bake it about an hour, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The combination of apples, dates and pecans in a pie tastes great! We decided to make this our default apple pie recipe."
2002350586,519547,2018-11-28,2,"I made these today, they smelled incredible, texture was fantastic BUT they were not sweet enough at all.. the flavor of the almond and butter overpowered the sweet aspect and they tasted bitter almost. I would suggest adding more stevia and possibly chocolate chips or spices to mask that weird bitter taste."
118007,13214,2004-07-09,4,"I love rum balls! I usually use 1/4 cup of rum. I've tried more but the balls come out too wet for me. If possible you should wait at least a week before eating them. Sometime you need to dust them with the sugar again.
 I store them in an empty Danish cookie tin. 

Sometimes I use Whaler's Vanille or other vanilla flavored rum. Coconut rum works good also."
705251,126596,2010-07-05,5,This is a beautiful recipe for a stunning dessert.  I loved the coconut in this loaf cake!  I took your advice in the intro and used it to serve with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  It was a star at the family dinner!!  I made sure to spray my glass loaf pan well and for the last 15 minutes I turned the oven down to 325 to help with the browning as the loaf center continued to bake (I do this with a lot of quick breads).  Perfectly moist and so delicious.  I'd like to try it with your hint of pineapple juice and also serve with fresh pineapple on the side.  Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup tag game!
424680,307678,2009-01-12,5,"Just for the heck of it I used a mix of cheeses in this recipe ~romano & mazzarella as well as parmesan (to appease by other half!) & that worked out well! I'd doubled the recipe & had them out on my finger food counter where they were gone in no time! Definitely worth making again! [Tagged, made & reviewed in Please Review My Recipe]"
1670583,297856,2012-02-14,5,"I don't usually eat broccoli, but this was awesome! It's like recipe #47188"
128473,483743,2012-08-07,5,"This was a lovely tart citrus tea AlainaF.  The spice ratio is perfect, you could taste all the individual spices and the juice.  It was very refreshing and a great contrast to my sweet breakfast. I enjoyed it very much.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Fearless Red Dragons - ZWT-8 - Australia"
356062,254918,2008-02-01,5,"What a great easy, but tasty pizza! I used whole wheat pizza dough, low cal bbq sauce, and used Hebrew National's 97% fat free hot dogs to make this a bit more healthy. This is a wonderful change from the normal red sauced based pizza. The potatoes were a great addition to the pizza as well. I plan on making many varations of this with diffrent types of leftover meats! I must say that this serves wayyyy more than four, with all of the toppings one slice filled me right up!"
2757176,60018,2013-03-27,0,this milkshake is the best i have EVER had!!!! i hope you accept my picture!!!
231219,137860,2006-01-23,4,i liked this recipe.. i added about 4 oz of tomato paste and let it cook for longer than 15 min.. Tasty for a quick lunch :) 
77458,489734,2013-05-18,5,"My sister made this exact cake for Mother&#039;s day .&lt;br/&gt; It is the most moist, tastiest cake I&#039;ve had in a long time! And there is no need for frosting. It&#039;s great &quot;as is&quot;."
58104,497981,2013-07-25,5,When I saw coconut oil in this I had to make. T&lt;br/&gt;Love the benefits and flavor of coconut.&lt;br/&gt;The eggs were nice and fluffy. I served with garlic chives and sliced purple tomatoes.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks
58241,33029,2003-01-08,5,"   This recipe was GREAT!!! 
  Flavor outstanding!!!       
So easy to make.
I own a deli and made this dish --
sold out instantly.
 "
870705,334417,2012-09-15,5,We really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it just as posted except I left out the garlic.  It would be good with cheese added at the end.  Made for Zaar Cookbook cooing tag game.
53932,225346,2007-05-28,5,"Very good and very mild.  I liked it as is, but had to add some garlic to mine."
11176,137262,2006-11-16,5,"FEED ME.  FEEEEEEEEED me this dish every day, like, forevah! Confession: I didn't grill these (dang daylight savings time), but baked them as you and Bobo did, then broiled a couple of minutes for a little more color. I can't wait to grill them... I can imagine the lovely outdoorsy flavor!  Definitely a 5-star recipe all the way.  Oh, and a side note: Earl normally doesn't touch people food (what kind of cat IS he, anyway?), but he ate a bite of this! I only allowed one bite so the rest would be MINE, all MINE! Stacy, thank you for a lovely chickie recipe - Straight into my ""Encore"" cookbook it went!"
394815,88486,2010-02-16,5,"These turned out awesome.  I used the bbq sauce recipe #19023 substituting low sugar ketchup and Splenda brown sugar to make a low sugar sauce.  I only baked the ribs for 30 minutes after I put on the sauce.  They turned out great, but if they baked any longer, they would have dried out.  My ribs were very meaty/low on fat and were on the small size.  That might contribute to the need to bake them less."
680579,12294,2008-09-23,4,"I thought this was great!  (Dh didn't really care for it, but I'm overriding him.)  I added some jalepeno and omitted the celery. I also used leftover turkey that I had frozen. Thanks so much for sharing.  I'll be makilng this again."
66847,52743,2003-02-28,5,delicious
1800108094,39087,2013-11-02,4,"Pretty awesome take on chicken alfredo! The sun dried tomatoes and basil add a special touch that I wasn&#039;t expecting. But the cajun seasoning adds just the right kick. I would make this again, perhaps with half-and-half to cut down on the cream. Also, I used the minimum amount of heavy cream for this recipe and it was saucy enough. Only took 25 minutes to pull this dinner together!"
52448,13269,2004-10-11,5,"Thank you MG for a care free and easy recipe!
I bought a shoulder roast for this recipe.
The pork was very tender and the gravy was very good, I used 3/4 of the can of Pepsi.
Will be made again!!

"
587597,119178,2009-02-23,5,"This stuff is great!  The only changes I made were that I used Crispix cereal instead of the Ritz Bits crackers and I halved the recipe, because we made the Pizza Flavored Snack MIx from this site with the other half (which is also yummy)."
4439,81237,2006-01-15,5,i had to make these with butterscotch chips and toasted pecan pieces because Ms. Picky is allergic to peanuts. Tasted like a pecan log and was very very tasty!!!
2002361699,80156,2018-12-14,0,This is the best gingerbread recipe ever great for cookies good for structure for gingerbread houses and the flavor is amazing make it make it make it thank you so much!!!!
35526,5200,2005-11-27,5,"I made these with the intention of using them on my holiday cookie tray.  After my walnut loving boyfriend tried them I have enough left for one cookie tray, lol.  Thanks for a great, although very rich, recipe!"
2001529238,33170,2017-06-06,1,"This is not jerk chicken. There is no allspice or scotch bonnet peppers, 2 essential ingredients in jerk seasoning. It's not even close. It's more like an Italian marinated chicken."
355637,26820,2009-09-21,4,"Very good! Took a lot longer than 15 minutes, but that definitely could have been just me. ;)"
39835,58879,2003-04-13,0,"Thanks Normaone for reviewing Monterey Chicken and also for mentioning that I omited mushrooms in the Ingredients. The ingredients should include 8 large mushrooms, chopped. Another reviewer also mentioned that she added 1 green and 1 red pepper, chopped which added color to the recipe. Thanks again."
620435,24612,2008-05-27,5,This cake was very easy to make and was enjoyed by all.  I changed the icing and made it with powdered sugar and warm water and added the 5 flavors as described.  Make sure you have a big enough bundt pan.  Mine was a little too small and it rose out of the pan but didn't leak over.  It baked perfectly in the recommended time.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!!
341478,87887,2006-08-11,5,"i had never eaten lamb shanks before, let alone cooked it myself, so i was very surprised at how easy this recipe was.  The sauce was delicious, flatmates loved it - said it was the best sauce they have ever had!  And the wasabi mashed spuds were really nice as well"
36128,32215,2004-02-18,5,"This was absolutely wonderful!!!  We had this for dinner on Sunday, and it was superb!  I served it with steamed carrots with melted butter, rolls, and mashed tatoes and used the ""gravy"" that was in the crockpot for over the top of it.  I also thickened it up a little with a cornstarch and milk mixture.  I will definetly be making this again!"
427184,193972,2009-05-03,5,"Nice dough. I skipped the sugar, and used a light olive oil. Thanks!"

Thanks for a nice alternative pork recipe keeper! [Tagged, made & reviewed as a PRESSIE in the Aus/NZ 12 Days of Christmas Recipe Swap]"
42041,68955,2009-01-16,5,"I have to rate this recipe. I made this, oh i don't know 20 times since i found it. I was born and raise in the Philippines. Since i started cooking i try to find the ""adobo"" recipe that i like but unfortunately there's nothing like the one we used  to make. But when when i found this i was really grateful. This was very similar to our adobo. If there is any filipino out there, they would know what i am talking about. I made few changes. I brown the chicken first and by the way you could also use pork or a combination of the two. i season the meat first with little salt and pepper not too much just to bring out the flavor of the meat. then brown them. I did not put any jalopeno the black pepper will give some spicinest to it.Pour the rest of the ingredients then simmer until the sauce thicken. My 6 years old daughter loved it, i mean absolutely in love with this recipe. She call it Japanese MOM'S Chicken. She said she could eat this everyday. Thank you so much for posting this recipe."
756031,289271,2008-03-07,4,"Had this last night.  I rarely use my crock-pot, but it was worth dusting it off for this recipe."
681033,10297,2008-09-11,5,Dressing is soooo good fresh and zesty my family loved this we didnt have turkey bacon so I used the applewood smoked that we had on hand and wow was it good every one wanted 2nds even my four year old daughter we will make again very soon thanks sassy cat for posting this  fast easy recipe
146486,176874,2007-01-25,5,This was really good. I used reduced fat cream of chicken and mushroom soup.  Definitely great comfort food!  Thanks for a yummy recipe!
131088,75955,2004-05-29,5,"I also did not bake the cake, but used the frosting recipe for a chocolate box cake.  I made a white frosting by leaving out the cocoa powder.  I made the cake for my husband-I'm more of a cookie person myself!-but I could not stop eating it because I LOVED the frosting.  Something about it.  It is so good.  I will try making the cake and the frosting sometime soon."
215014,107786,2009-02-21,5,are you kidding me these are the best ribs ever! The season on them is perfect I have never tasted anything like it. Will be making this more often than not. Can't wait to try it again.
14410,187210,2007-03-24,5,Very good and very easy. I was making cajun chicken-fried steak and discovered...no cajun seasoning in the cupboard. I'll never buy another jar again!
306797,190940,2007-11-17,5,"I found this recipe during ZWT3, but didn't get to make it until today.  After cutting myself badly on the pineapple tin, I recommend putting the pineapple into another container before freezing.  I made as per the recipe except that I used Malibu coconut rum, crushed pineapple in juice & probably used a little more coconut milk & rum than in the recipe.  Very tasty treat that wasn't too bad for my waist."
90767,89725,2006-04-25,5,"I can see why this is the highest rated beef stroganoff on *zaar!  Wonderfully flavorful and extremely easy!  Thanks for the post, Roze!"
56718,31349,2003-01-17,5,This is a great recipe--I make these green beans frequently with our meals.  The only change I make is a steam the green beans and then add them to the oil mixture and stir.  Thank you!
52282,203715,2007-02-21,5,this makes a quick delicious dinner. i used half white wine and half water to simmer the mussels. it's too cold here to use the grill so i put the mussels under the broiler for a few minutes. the vinegary green peppercorns lemon and butter made a wonderful sauce.
826620,43817,2009-08-23,5,"This was easy and delicious - made it on a Friday night and cooked it the following morning for a late weekend breakfast.  I used about half the recommended ""dose"" of dry mustard and it was just enough to hint but not overpower.  I also was afraid the bacon and sausage would be too much ""meat,"" but it was a great blend of flavors and not one thing overpowered the other.  It's a keeper!"
2001504418,141983,2017-04-24,5,Didn't change a thing. It was a hit!
201581,63986,2007-04-18,5,"I used 4 boneless chops and the full measure of soup and seasonings. I stirred in a package of Express Rice (the kind that microwaves in 90 seconds) for the last 30 minutes of cooking. Delicious, and the leftovers were even better! Made for Alphabet Soup Game."
121193,309381,2008-07-19,5,I thought this was really good.  I doubled the amount of sour cream & parmesan cheese so that there was more sauce.  I also added some red chili flakes.  I'll definitely be making this again!
1463206,27021,2011-05-28,0,"Fresh rhubarb is VERY scarce in Orange County, at least in Orange, so when I actually had THREE stalks left over after making a different pie, I went in search..I love rhubarb, and I LOVE CUSTARD.  Turns out 3 stalks was EXACTLY the amount I needed chopped for the pie! I used a frozen whole wheat crust I had in the freezer, added a bit of vanilla and baked it in a water bath to leave the custard creamy...INCREDIBLE!  Thank you for posting"
269430,264565,2009-03-06,5,"These pancakes are awesome, they are my favorite, taste just like banana bread. I substituted the eggs for egg product (egg beaters), and they came perfect.  Thanks for posting."
198154,154861,2010-03-01,4,"Made this for MIL's birthday. It was enjoyed by everyone. The only thing we didn't like was that the juice from the berries ran. So even though it didn't look as pretty as when I first made it, it tasted great! And who can complain about nice, sweet, juicey berries in February!  Thanks"
470920,41950,2008-04-08,5,Used whole milk and added a bit of butter to fatten it up for my skinny toddler and he LOVED it.  I did too!
163112,424710,2010-06-14,5,"This is delicious!  There was a nice touch of heat, too.  I did add the entire bunch of scallions, chopped, but I love them!!  Fantastic flavor, very easy & everybody loved it.  I served it with recipe#428612.  MAde for ZWT6.  :)"
596377,40788,2007-12-10,2,"I liked the unusual combination of ingredients, but the flavor didn't quite pop.  The apricots did a nice job of soaking up the flavor the apricots, but more flavor is needed in general for the entree."
941715,99103,2008-12-27,5,I have made this several times and it has yet to fail me.  We prefer a thicker soup so I reduce the some of the liquid.  I also use half chicken stock half water.  Very flavorful hearty soup!
22278,989,2001-12-23,4,"It was quick and easy, but there was not enough of the ""dough"" to cover the peaches.  I had to adjust the recipe with more flour,"
1802849661,227439,2016-03-16,4,"This is so delicious! It has that perfect tart/sweet contrast that just makes it one beautiful sandwich filler. I&#039;m always looking for new ideas to fill sandwiches as my OH gets bored, now we can add this one to the rotation!"
2000822050,4271,2017-05-28,5,Awesome just do 1/2 a cup of sugar and it is so yummy!

89831,88880,2004-06-14,5,"This is so good, we had it tonight with Miss Annie's sausage Pie. This is one of the best recipes for asparagus...just wonderful, nice and lemony with just the perfect combination of flavors, DH and myself are big lovers of feta cheese, so this just fit the bill, just delicious!. Thanks so much Sue L for another winner, I will be definately be making this again....Kitten :)"
188837,192,2007-03-05,5,"I used Heavy Cream and added white chocolate chips, cranberries and some slivered almonds - and these were amazing! Everyone loved them, and were surprised at the cake/cookie texture, as they look like biscuits!  Came together very easily too and could be altered for different ingredients!"
713096,88794,2008-01-02,4,"Made this yesterday for a Hawaiian themed party.  It was a hit with everyone!  I, too changed the topping to 4 TBL butter.  I think next time I will also add a TBL or 2 more brown sugar for the topping."

599450,89678,2008-09-08,5,"This is a recipe where 5 stars is not enough! This is sooo delicious that even picky DH said it is ""exceptional for a Zaar dish""! This is simple and outstanding. A side salad, a little rice, and a baguette is all you'd need for a romantic dinner for two! Thanks, Baby Kato! Made for Photo Tag."
2302567,341903,2012-10-07,5,"Love that I don't have to worry about whether the chicken is cooked.  Good flavor.  The nutrition info is WAY off.  A teaspoon of salt has 2400 mg sodium so there is no way a single leg could have 1084 mg (a chicken leg with skin has less than 200 mg sodium, so I know the increase isn't that).  Each drumstick prolly has between 250-500 mg sodium depending on how much breading we pack on."

278274,112212,2009-07-08,2,"I followed the recipe exactly as written for the 4th of July, but my guests barely ate it. I thought it was DIFFERENT, but not anything I'd try again. The chili powder took over the mango taste."
451700,251329,2008-04-29,4,"Lovely rice dish! I added in just 1 jalapeno since I didn't want to make it too spicy for DD and we all enjoyed it! Thank you, Clare, for sharing this wonderful recipe, definitely will be making it again! Made for PAC Spring '08."
1122161,96925,2010-11-05,5,"We really liked this pasta dish. I thought it might be a little plain but was surprised how everything went together really well, and it had alot of flavor. I used two 9oz frozen packages of spinach and 4 large roma tomatoes with the skin left on. It all fit nicely in a 9x13 inch casserole dish.  Thanks for posting!"
661999,50412,2009-12-02,5,I have never attempted making mashed potatoes ahead of time so I thought I would give it a try really not expecting them to be as good as made to order. I was wrong! These were terrific.  I used half & half instead of whipping cream but otherwise followed the recipe.  They get five stars because they taste wonderful and the for the ease of preparation.  Thanks for the recipe!
253974,160226,2009-12-15,5,"These are sooo easy!!!
I made a double batch, so that I can possibly have some left for us after I send some to Calif. Not doing so well! lol Deeelish! Thanks ChaCha! Made for KK's Cfef's Pick event"

351811,210409,2007-09-17,5,"This is another one I tried over the weekend with my bottle of ~X... I liked it!  It was sweet with the lemonade and fusion liqueur.  I had to admit,  I added a salted rim and it was delicious. Balanced the sweetness with a bit of salt, just the way I like it! I will definitely make this again. Thanks for a *keeper* MommyD Cheers ~V"
131751,16531,2004-03-17,2,"My husband loved it, but I was disappointed in the taste after reading such good reviews. Probably would not make again."
56463,31349,2005-12-27,5,"These are great! I had some really nice fresh green beans for Christmas dinner and made this recipe with them and they were exceptional. I followed the recipe and these were so flavorful and have a nice presentation.
Thanks, Carole in Orlando"
138429,147090,2005-12-07,5,"I made up this recipe to serve in place of fruit cake on my holiday tray. There may not be any left till Christmas, I just keep sampling. I added cherries and nuts. After simmering the carrot mixture I left it on the counter for about 13 hours and the next morning added the soda then slowly added the flour mixture. put the mixture into 2 loaf pans and baked for 2 hours. Out of the oven came this beautiful moist fruit cake. The smell from  it baking was just devine. So easy to put together and very inexpensive to make. This will be my Christmas fruit cake from here on in.  The recipe is already in my Christmas folder. "
767039,531161,2018-10-27,0,"3 Ingredients? Plus four spices , not to mention the seven or eight ingredients for serving. But carnitas is not just braised pork (roasted in liquid). So without the extra ingredients (the spices), there is very little flavor.. I actually like your recipe, it tasted great, but it is not a 3-ingredient recipe."
1246968,262140,2009-08-11,5,I made this last night and it turned out wonderful! I added a small amount of dried Lovage from our herb garden. I made the cheese garlic bread (recipe 18914) to go along with it and it was a great combination.
262203,246959,2008-05-21,4,"I have used this quite a few times, and sometimes change it up slightly based on who I'm cooking for.  Some people don't care as much for soy sauce as I do, and for them I use 2 T soy sauce and either 2 T reduced-sodium beef broth, or 1 T worcestershire sauce and 1 T reduced-sodium beef broth.  Made any of the ways though, it's a winner!"
646042,50767,2007-11-11,4,"My four year old tasted this one and said, ""Mommy, I bet they have this in Heaven!."" Definitely a keeper, even if only for when Daddy is out of town.  I left out the chives since my kids have an aversion to anything green in their food.  This is also good even if you leave out the seasoned croutons!"
2002167039,29100,2018-05-27,4,I had to add 2/3 more room temp water to sponge. Turned out pretty good!
353579,13379,2008-07-17,5,Lovely!  I thought the tart/sweet level was just right.  I used granny smith apples and sprinkled just a touch of sugar over them before putting on the crumble topping.  I also added a bit of cinnamon and allspice to the mix.  A simple and delicious fruity dessert.  Thanks for posting!
2422141,486261,2012-10-09,5,Over the top great! Will definitely make this again.
133174,223591,2007-11-08,4,"This was cooked in the crockpot and made a very filling breakfast that lasted throughout the morning.  At serving, I tossed in some dried cranberries, added 1 1/2 teaspoons of recipe #145505, drizzled a touch of maple syrup over each serving, topped with non-fat plain yogurt and a sprinkling of sliced almonds.  A nice change from oatmeal."
369715,20233,2009-01-01,5,I made this for a Christmas party and everyone enjoyed it. I followed the recipe exactly as written Yummy minty pie which was easy to make.
1622480,53343,2010-06-01,5,"I made this for a Memorial Day BBQ as the requisite non-meat entree (mainly so I'd have something to eat) and it was awesome! Even the meat eaters enjoyed it. I was amazed at how quick it was to fix. I did let it simmer on the stove for an extra half hour and I used chipotle powder (because my grocery didn't have the canned pepper) but it still had that rich, smokey chipotle flavor. Nutricious and delicious--this will be a summer staple!"
11461,53758,2007-06-02,5,"Thanks, beckas!  DH and I were looking for something a little different for breakfast, so we tried this.  YUM!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and fried the tortillas until they were crispy.  (They soften up again when you add the egg mixture.)  I used Kraft Mexican Style Four Cheese that comes pre-grated in a bag.  I wanted to use the rest of the bag up, so I probably had most of a cup of the mixture.  DH doctored his up with Tabasco Chipotle sauce, but I ate mine plain, and we both enjoyed them.  Super delicious!"
239808,113817,2006-06-08,5,"really tasty! My asparagus was a bit on the thick side, so i blanched it for a minute or two before adding to the foil parcels, and it turned out perfectly"
39835,61851,2009-08-01,5,These are great! We had these on a very busy day and supper was ready in a flash! No one even asked for usual hamburg/taco mix -- yummy! We will be having these again soon -- in fact I am going to stock up on the garbanzo beans and the other ingredients so I can make these whenever I don't feel like making dinner but want something fast and good! Thanks for sharing!
359533,99156,2009-07-10,4,very good!
2000760176,141940,2015-12-21,5,"I love this recipe! I have been making this for my family for years from the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook.  Which by the way is the most fantastic cookbook! I wanted to make this recipe, but we had just moved and I had no idea where my cookbook was packed in all the moving boxes.  Deb saved me by posting this recipe.  Thank you Deb!"
78466,134775,2006-11-11,5,"These low-fat biscuits are a real winner in appearance, taste, and texture! I was totally surprised at how good they are and easy to whip up. My Taste Of Home magazine chart said to add 1 tsp of baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp baking soda for each cup of flour, so that is what I used to sub for the self rising flour. The only problem I had was my dough was too runny and I didn't want to add too much more flour so I ended up making drop biscuits instead. They turned out a lovely golden brown and were light, moist, and delicious! What more could you ask for? Thank you Mama for a wonderful recipe!"
75705,77992,2004-05-16,5,"I only used 2 pounds of meat, and I used 1/2 turkey and 1/2 ground sirloin.  It was yummy.  Different taste, but still awesome comfort food."
573325,424532,2011-10-25,5,"This worked like a charm! THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this wonderful money-saver of a recipe with us, XAbbbyy!<br/>Made and reviewed for PAC Fall 2011."
797706,335676,2011-03-02,0,"I hate giving bad reviews, especially when a recipe has a lot of potential like this one, so I'm not going to rate it - the problem with the recipe is that it is MUCH too dry, there's no way it'll stick together as is... I had to add 1/2 cup of skim milk so it would have a decent texture. I did make a few modifications but those shouldn't have affected the consistency. I used cocoa instead of carob powder, subbed part of the soymilk powder with ground flaxseed and some berry-green powder, and used corn syrup instead of honey (honey's just too expensive to experiment with). I also nuked (30 sec) the peanut butter/syrup so it would be easier to mix. The flavour is quite good, but if you're expecting something sweet, you'll need to add more sweetener, or shape into balls and roll in some powdered sugar. It's more of an energy-ball type snack than fudge."
335855,410728,2012-12-13,5,"Wow, that was easy!  I used my cast iron skillet and melted butter instead of oil.  So tasty!"
93997,217263,2007-05-07,5,These were very good. I think 1 teaspoon of baking powder would have been fine and next time I'll add just a touch more butter. Very easy and quick to make. Great to serve with a meal when you don't have any dinner rolls or anything in the house. Thanks for the recipe. Will make again.
496999,82591,2009-09-23,5,"Delicioius! Made this for sub sandwiches tonight (on Crusty French Bread, Recipe #101476) and it was perfect! I loved it and it was definately a hit with DH who was worried it might be rationed for the guests coming this weekend."
85416,30951,2007-11-21,5,I have made these several times and we all love them.  They add a lot of color to the plate as well.
323186,357116,2009-04-15,5,"I'm not the greatest baker and these worked out well for me!   I was a little worried that I didn't have enough dough, but in fact it puffs out beautifully, with a delicious pesto surprise instead!    
I used an olive pesto, and took most of these to friends for Sunday lunch, but DH made sure he kept some aside for himself!
This is definitely a make again, a great snack and very nice for offering to guests!

Thank you, Catherine!

Made for PAC Spring 2009"
149295,103403,2013-08-28,0,"Thanks for this recipe!  I would take this over any restaurant French dip sandwich any day!  The au jus was right on target in terms of taste and consistency.  After cooking the meat it in the crockpot, I shredded it and let it sit in the juices so they would soak in a bit before we had dinner the result was fabulous."
131126,116443,2005-02-18,5,"My DHâs comment was âingenious!â  We both thought the flavors worked together well.  I will confess to scrambling the egg in the one for me.  I have a major fear of runny eggs and wasnât sure if they would cook up firm in 20 minutes.  It worked fine scrambled and DHâs egg was firm enough I could have eaten it.  My only suggestion might be to sprinkle a tiny bit of salt on the potato before layering on the spinach.  This is a recipe DH has already requested again!  Great job!
"
491337,143991,2008-04-06,0,I saw these in Woman's Day or Family Circle a couple of years ago. We made ours with the same ingredients but added red hots for feet and mini M&M's for eye. The kids loved them. The ingredients for this are pretty high but a good activity for about 30 minutes. My 2 1/2 year old needed help but my older kids did just fine.
474155,103762,2007-03-31,5,"Didn't try the brownie mix, but the frosting is wonderful!!"
35526,108522,2005-03-19,5,This works perfectly.  I made a turkey and cheese sandwich on whole wheat and made it this way and it was fantastic!!
1832505,152441,2011-02-21,5,"Though I had to substitute ground ginger for fresh grated, these were delicious! I'll be making them again!"
793153,207320,2008-03-25,5,Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!  Our nanny used to make  this for us and now I can make it too!
344231,218503,2007-09-15,5,"Really great slice.  I used fresh kumera and ""normal"" pesto...the final product was VERY tasty.  This was part of my daughter's 18th birthday brunch and it was very well received...not even enough crumbs to feed a mouse. (:  Thanks, Jubes.  Will make this again for sure."
173880,203762,2008-02-15,5,Nice blend of flavors...we especially enjoyed the flavor from the peanut butter! I didn't have a lime so I used lemon juice and I added thinly sliced carrots and celery and a roughly chopped onion instead of the zucchini and red pepper. The whole dish comes together quickly too!
144038,51997,2004-07-21,5,YUMMY! YUMMY! YUMMY! I used 1/3 a cup of applesauce and a little dash of oil in place of the oil and I added 1/4 cup of wheat germ with 1 1/4 cup of flour.  I am always on the lookout for healthy muffins for my kids to grab on the way to school.  I tried using whole wheat flour for 1/2 the flour a different time but they came out to heavy.  This time they turned out wonderful(very moist).  My kids keep asking for more! I will make these again soon.
394592,51924,2008-06-07,5,"This is a fantastic recipe!!!  I have had this saved in my Zaar cookbook since I first joined and finally took the opportunity to make it playing the 'Healthy Choices Tag Game'...SO GLAD...SO GOOOoooD!!!  :)  I Had some chick peas on hand and had about 2 cups  sprouting (I didn't use jar method...I like to do it in a colander..I find it easier and cleaner)  added another about 1/12 cups the next day...day/day+1/2 later to another colander batch {{ I liked the effect of the different degrees of ""growth"" and ""crunch""}} :)... I mixed all ingredients as suggested in the machine in batches, reserving some beans for munching and other stuff (**I only had sweet white miso on hand and can't buy more till that's gone**  {{$$$}}   -  it was FINE )...My processor can only handle so much so I mixed  the beans & the nut/seed mixtures together by hand after pureeing in batches...I left bits of bean & seed chunks and also added diced jalapeno and sweet red peppers while hand mixing because I like texture......for me this worked better then all ""Mush"" !  Fabulous flavor, fabulously different and fabulously filling stuff!! :)  You can eat this for days and re-invent it as many different snacks and meals...I have had it raw over spinach with my own salsa mix dressing...and my husband likes it as a dip with carrots etc * (we have eaten it right from the container with our fingers {{{YUM}}}  :) **   --- we have heated it for  burritos with tofu cheese and also topped it with grilled veggies for a huge dinner plate (I could go on and on like that guy on the bus in ""Forest Gump"" did about shrimp about these beans {{lol}} - but I will stop myself :)...TRY THIS IT IS DARN GOOD STUFF!!!  LOVE* LOVE* LOVE* THESE BEANS!! _----Thanks Missy Wombat :)  A new HUGE FAVORITE!!!"
2001442983,344319,2017-03-18,5,Very easy and flavorful! Gravy was easy as well! Definitely a keeper!
231054,159615,2006-09-30,2,"I hate giving this 2 stars -- but it really was just ""OK"" for us.  I think it was the cumin --  it just didn't seem to ""compliment"" the potatos and cheese.  My onion was large -- and I wished I had only used half of it.  I'm not sure I'll make it again.  I have a lot of your recipes, Kittencal -- and this is the first one that we've really not enjoyed to the fullest.

Thanks,

88099,385129,2012-10-13,0,I loved this salad and it was as stated just beautiful to look at.  I made as directed using recipe #368677 for the dressing.  Worked out just great.  A salad I'll made often.  Thanks.  Made for PAC Fall 2012
1628373,316263,2014-05-24,4,"HEALTHY &amp; EASY, Yes Please!  I am rating this recipe according to the variation that I made.  As others suggested, I added jalapeno&#039;s and chili powder.  Also, I added a few things that I had around: 1 bay leaf, a pinch of cumin, a pinch of salt, onion powder, chili flakes, and a dash of parm. cheese.  As other&#039;s suggested, I cut the meatballs up a bit.  I didn&#039;t cook it in the crock pot b/c of lack of time.  It was delicious on the stove top.  After cooking, I added sour cream and corn chips.  I believe that next time I will add some orzo (cooking it separately and adding it in near the end of the cooking time).  Thank you for such a versatile recipe!"
895132,322957,2010-09-02,5,"Mmmh, these were so good!! Used gluten free flour mix (1/4 coconut flour, 1/4 arrowroot starch, 1/4 sweet rice flour, 1/4 millet flour) and took it to a gathering - no one guessed they were gluten free and they disappeared completely and very quickly! Thanks for sharing this winner!<br/>Made for Ramadan Tag 2010."
86318,85852,2004-11-24,5,"This is a very good, moist and easy to make batter bread. I used currants, pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds, because that's what I had, and it turned out beautifully. I did use about 1/4 cup less bread flour than called for because stirring became too hard. This is lovely with cream cheese. Thank you very much for sharing the recipe with us. "
286566,226408,2013-08-08,5,"I scaled back for 2 eggs and used about a tablespoon of pesto, the only change I would make is to beat the eggs and pesto in a bowl together first and then cook cup in the fry pan but otherwise I very much enjoyed with a slice of wholemeal/wholegrain toast."
863930,411056,2012-01-05,5,"Wow!  Wintery comfort food delishousness!  I used chopped onions instead of frozen pearl; stewed tomatoes, and a nice cabernet wine.  It was out of this world!  Next time I will add a bit of corn starch to thicken the fabulous broth.  MMMMMM THANKS FOR A GREAT MEAL!!!"
223979,95893,2008-09-28,5,This is a great marinade.  We used it to make chicken wings.  I marinated the wings for about 8 hours and then baked them at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes.  I did broil them for about 1 minute just to get them extra brown.  I really like five-spice-powder!  I doubled this recipe and it was great!  Thanks ~Lainie~!  We will make this again!
186149,54854,2005-01-08,4,This recipe is simple and easy to make. It is also extremely tasty!!!
41503,91363,2004-07-11,5,Yum! I loved this Shaye! I love frozen drinks and I've had Fuzzy Navels in the past but never thought to make a frosty navel lol It's a perfect summertime drink. I'll be making this often ;-) Thanks brat!
27643,31147,2003-07-29,5,"Oh my!! This is wonderful! Such an easy recipe, and boy does it turn out a very classy salmon. Superb taste. That cream cheese and tomato mixture is yummy! A great change from the ordinary way I usually fix it. I will use this recipe a lot. Thanks Carol!!"

537578,107956,2008-03-09,5,"Very very very good!  Followed directions exactly, except I missed the part about mixing the cheese in with the dressing and chicken so I just sprinkled it on the tortilla.  I also used wheat tortillas.  Thanks for the great recipe!"
109110,151223,2007-04-23,5,I make this for company.  The dressing is a lovely pink.
142335,13087,2009-03-20,0,I won't rate this since I messed it up. I subbed splenda for the sugar out of habit. Well you know how there are just some times when you shouldn't sub it? I think was one of those times. Will make again soon and follow recipe. Just wanted to post a picture for you!
192332,181186,2006-10-27,4,"GREAT SOUP!!!  I agree with <a href=""/member/292812"">Chef #292812</a>'s comment about adding milk late in cooking to prevent curdling.  HOWEVER, that leaves the main cooking time without enough fluid.  I used just enough chicken broth to make sufficient fluid for cooking and it was good but would like to hear what others might have done about this problem."
4470,68955,2007-11-05,5,"What a wonderful sauce - loved the chicken!  I used skinless boneless thighs and I can only imagine how wonderful drumsticks with skin on would be.  The thighs came out moist and loaded with flavor.  Served over basmati rice, steamed fresh carrots & green beans.  Wonderful dinner thanks Jan"
2000067311,210247,2016-10-11,5,"I made this lasagna last night for my family and guests. I found it to be very easy to make. The un-cooked lasagna noodles caught me a little off guard, but they were perfect when the baking time was up. Everyone loved the flavor, texture, blend of shrimp, crab, and cheeses. My mother-in-law even asked me to email her the recipe. This one's a keeper and I will be making it again."
65573,230211,2008-12-03,5,This was fantastic! I made up the marinade the night before and just threw everything in a pan when I got home from work the next day. DH said this is his new favorite dish! I plan to make a few batches as OAMC to have on hand for a quick meal. Made for PRMR tag game.
418915,121053,2008-08-31,5,"Loved the rich and flavorful sauce that was created with the addition of garlic, white wine and tomatoes.  I tried two recipes with shrimp and feta, and I preferred this recipe over the other one."

989152,71537,2008-10-14,4,"I wanted a more cake like substance so I added a half cup of oil, another cup of flower, and two eggs. I baked it in a 9x13 glass pan so my cooking time was less than a hour maybe 35 minutes. I liked the spices and also added nuts. I made a cream cheese frosting made with 1/2 pack cream cheese, 2cups powdered sugar, a splash of milk, and a bit of butter. 
Thanks for the great recipe!"
583193,119767,2012-10-20,0,This was excellent.  I left out the sunflower seeds as I didn't have any but it was still really good.  Great sweetness for when you have a sugar craving!

For those who I know like it very hot, I use Habanero's and Jalapeno's, and for those who like it more mild, I use jalapeno's and a bell pepper (any color), but always the peppers are from my garden, and now I grow more each year, to keep up with the demand of this awesome Jelly."
465056,266170,2007-12-09,5,Looks like chocolate mousse - my DH wanted to know why I was serving chocolate mousse with french toast.
138429,115321,2006-11-02,5," These little treats are great.  I did  use the garlic and jalapeno puree. Whipped up in no time and an empty platter not long after. I did divide the cream cheese mixture and added more garic and jalapeno puree to half, and less to the other half. A real croud pleaser. Thanks Gerry!"
171084,15431,2008-12-10,5,"We love these cookies!  It must be a Midwestern thing as all the schools around my hometown fixed these at least once a month!!  During the Christmas holiday season, use green food coloring and shape into wreaths or trees and garnish with little red hot candies.  Thanks again for a blast from the past!"
854048,348492,2009-05-26,3,"I had high hopes for this one! I don't know what I did wrong but mine completely fell apart and it took a really long time for mine to brown on both sides. I halved the recipe exactly and even drained the onions. I ended up with about 9 patties. I even tried cooking on fry pan until brown on one side and then sticking in the oven for about 10 minutes at 450. They were a little bit better, but still fell apart. The taste was good. I used cilantro instead of parsley and 1 minced clove of garlic. I may attempt some other time. I also used my food processor to grate the carrot - maybe the chunks were too big?"
145637,13073,2005-01-30,2,"Good ingredients, but way too dry!  This can be easily fixed with some olive oil. And for garlic lovers, as with everything, increase the garlic amount.  Different sausage flavors are good too."
15572,28520,2002-09-29,3,Only so-so for us.  Sorry.
136997,256451,2011-10-21,5,Nice accompaniment to a hot bowl of soup on a cold fall day. Made for Pick A Chef Fall 2011. :)
1921136,536,2011-06-02,5,Super easy to make!! Great taste!  My boyfriend loved it so much it was all gone in 2 days!! We however didn't put in any of the vegetables and left out the sage. This is something we will definitely be making again soon!!!
38172,2886,2005-04-22,5,"yummy, yummy, I have made this banana bread twice in one week. It's sooo good, I keep telling my husband to try some but my kids and I eat it all before he gets a chance!"
519066,34452,2007-06-18,5,wonderful recipe made this yesturday however i made a couple of changes instead of milk i use 1/2 cup of peach juice from canned peaches and instead of 1/2cup of sugar to sprinkle over peaches i use 1/4 cup of sugar. i double the recipe and use a 9x13 glass baking dish turn out good nice and golden
788178,3954,2013-01-13,5,"Perfect. I usually substitute old-fashioned oats for the quick-cooking, and use a half cup of whole wheat flour, and have had no disappointments. I've also cut choc. chips to 1 cup and they are still extremely chocolatey (and yummy) cookies!!"
226887,168785,2006-09-26,4,"This dish is a great way to disguise leftovers.  I made this to using some leftover pork loin and veggies.  I did not add in the butter, and the sauce remained creamy and flavorful.  The flavors were mello, so I will add a little hot sauce to the dish next time.    "

I brought it to work for my dinner and placed it in the staff fridge.  Apparently there were people in the staff room arguing with each other, that I was going to share the salad with them.  Well I did shared it with them, only not the share they were looking for, printed a few copies of the recipe and 'shared' it around.  Thank you mummamills for quick to make and yummy salad"
1964159,132263,2011-07-22,4,used white flour & a bit of cinamon.half the amount of baking powder.my fussy & vegan (due 2 alergies) little eater is munching them !!yeyyy!!thanks for a great recipe.
2168699,116601,2012-02-01,4,"We used tilapia for our first attempt to fish tacos with this recipe. No cabbage for us. Just used cilantro, salsa, lemon juice, onions and the spices recommended in the recipe. We used the small whole wheat tortilla and it tasted great! We will do this one again (hubby told me: make sure you save this recipe!) :D the only bad part was that i didn't make enough to have left overs! :)<br/>we had it along with Mexican Casserole (http://www.recipematcher.com/index.php/recipe/match/Mexican-Casserole)"
17803,11493,2007-06-13,4,"This would be a 5 star recipe but there are a few problems with it.  So here it goes.  This recipe says to use a '15' ounce 'can' of tomato paste.  Well, tomato paste does not come in a can that size, at least not here in Iowa.  I'm wondering if she meant tomato sauce which does come in a 15 ounce can.  I felt that if you would add the paste and the soup together without any other liquid it would be to thick. This  would in turn cause the mixture to  be to thick and then you could not simmer the mixture for 15 minutes without  it burning.  Keeping all this in mind, I decided on using the 15 ounces of tomato sauce.  This mixture of sauce and soup simmered nicely for the stated 15 minutes.  Next I used 9 ounces of noodles, you could even use 12 ounces without any problems.  Which I was glad, as if I used the recommended 6 ounces it would not  been enough when it came to layering the hot diah.  The last thing, there was no baking temperature stated.  So I decided on 375 degrees.  And since everything was hot already (except the cheese) I bake it for 30 minutes covered then 15 minutes uncovered, 10 would have been enough.  The outcome with all the changes was a great tasting hot dish.  I hope all this information will help you if you decide to make this recipe.  Made this for My 3 Chefs game 2007... Theme: Recipes having these words in title 'Hot Dish'"
215014,31083,2008-07-16,4,I made this for a friend's birthday and it turned out great! Could not have asked for anything better! I always thought cheesecake was hard to make but turns out not to be. Thanks
340141,159073,2006-09-15,4,Very delicious and easy to put together.  Would not change a thing.
400708,159982,2015-06-28,5,"This was so good, made from cherries from our trees, and used SS chocolate chunks, so cream, and good.  Can&#039;t wait to make it again.  This is sure to be a favorite thanks so much for posting"
115054,28943,2009-06-26,5,"Karen, this is a fabulous pie crust.  I'd never been able to make such a flaky crust.  The flavour is perfect for savoury pies and sweet pies and tarts.  Thanks so much!"
173314,96204,2006-01-10,5,Soo good that is all I can say!
131674,38366,2008-08-19,5,This is my father's favorite recipe.  When I asked him what he wanted for his 79th birthday this was it.  He really enjoyed it.  Thank you for sharing.
659138,40727,2013-07-15,5,"SUPER EASY, SUPER GOOD.  I did add Tony Cachere&#039;s to my pot and if you&#039;re feeding more than 4, double the recipe!"
400708,203112,2008-03-13,4,"I followed the recipe exactly and really enjoyed it.  Was a little nervous about adding the carrots but found it to be rather nice.  While wheat spaghetti is not my favorite either - if not overcooked it's OK and we all know much healther.  As I'm alone most of the time, I divided this into 1 serving portions and froze so I can take out whenever I need a quick dinner - and only 5 points.  Thanks helluvawoman for a very nice recipe that was easy to put together."
172256,38996,2005-02-06,4,"Was looking for a good compfort food to make one night and picked this. I didn't add the herbs to the dumplings, for our taste. Overall it was very good, I especially liked the sauce, Will make this again in the future."

233829,116236,2013-08-07,5,"I really liked this as did my guests at a recent cookout.  Followed directions as written.  I didn&#039;t have a problem with it being runny until the next day, which is typical for this type of salad.  But it was still good to eat the next day.  Will make again.  Thanks."
212497,283311,2012-05-04,4,"I followed this recipe as written and I ran into a few problems. First, the mashed potatoes were like a giant, hard blob. I had to add another 2 Tbsp of butter and another half cup of milk (on top of the cream) to get them to resemble the texture of mashed potatoes. I also added the 2 egg yolks that were suggested. After this, they were very good. Second, there wasn't much taste to the meat mixture before I put it in the deep dish to bake it. I added some more tomato paste, garlic powder and seasoned salt and it was good. I also wish that I would have used beef stock instead of chicken. But the final result was tasty, nonetheless. I'll make it again with the beef broth because the rosemary and thyme were great, it just needed a little extra ""something."" Thanks for posting!"
1162654,100763,2009-02-13,5,Great recipe! I multiplied it by 15 to make enough for my desserts at work (I'm a pastry chef at a retirement community). It turns out perfect every time and the residents LOVE it!
476053,215919,2010-06-25,1,I very much wanted to like these but they were a major disaster at our party. I followed the recipe and didn't change anything but it came out tasting really weird and nasty (not like crab rangoon) so I probably won't be making these again.
137854,366087,2009-06-21,5,"Our toddlers found great joy in calling this duck ""yuck"" (they loved it, actually), but all I could groan was ""Wooow ... wow ... WOW!"" when eating the gorgeous greasy crispiness of the soy-gingery duck fat. It was AMAZING! I was dubious about steps 1 & 2, but you really could taste the star anise in the cooked meat, and it made an excellent gravy base. WORTHY SUBSTITUTIONS: ""Chilli"" Soy Sauce for plain soy sauce, Ginger Wine for sherry, 1 T. minced gingerroot for ginger juice. I also added 1 minced garlic clove to the LOVELY, zingy marinade. [[Now about that gravy -- duck giblets, 2"" gingerroot, 2 leeks, and veg. boullion cube boiled 1 hr in the duck stock. 1/3 c. flour fried in 2 T. duck fat; gradually add strained duck stock until it is a ""gravy"" consistency.  Add strained veggies/giblets(?), & puree.  Add 1/4+ of the duck marinade, and salt to taste!]] THANKS for posting a restaurant-worthy recipe!"
152393,70522,2005-03-20,3,"Since St. Patrick's Day was a work day I felt it was the perfect time to try this one out.  I had 2 corned beef, total weight about 6 lbs.  I used a few carrots, onions, both seasoning packets and put cabbage on top. (No room for potatoes so I boiled them on the stove).  Since I had so much beef, I took your suggestion and cooked it on high for the 8-9  hours I was at work.  The beef had a different flavor that both DH and I liked, but both DD's said they preferred it cooked without the beer.  None of us liked the cabbage very much.  I think all in all that we will leave out the beer and make it the traditional way in the future.  This was an interesting and easy way to cook it, though.  Thanks for submitting."
284904,91454,2007-08-20,4,"I agree with kittencal, this is a awesome recipe.. shared a loaf with friends they loved it also. All wanted the recipe.. will make often."
368410,108401,2007-04-18,5,What a crowd pleaser. I run a OAMC group and everyone just gave it great ratings. Plus a mother in my group has a picky eater who has declared salmon to be his new favorite food of all time! Now that's one great recipe! Thank you.
33159,109839,2005-07-23,5,"Although these are quite time-consuming (it took me a lot longer than 20 minutes to prepare & fill the berries), the end result is impressive in presentation & taste!"
81522,123993,2007-04-09,5,I made this for Easter.  I had doubled the recipe and used a 9x13-inch baking dish.  It was FANTASTIC!! I made it the night before and it was delicious cold the next day.  Guests were fighting over the last piece. I had no left overs.....Thanks for sharing!!

I changed the recipe I used real cabot butter and I didn't use butter flavored extract, because I used real butter.
I bake and cook with real butter all the time,because the flavor is better when you use real butter.
I will continue to make this recipe.
Thanks for sharing KC Cooker."
19540,138440,2005-10-21,5,"This is one of those old-fashioned dishes that brings picnics of days past to mind with one taste. For that alone, I love it. I made it with ground turkey instead of beef, which worked out fine. Next time, I'll cut the barbecue sauce just a bit so there's less liquid. I put cheese on top, but it's really not necessary. I'm sure this would be great without it."
632249,100362,2011-02-11,5,"I really, really like this soup! I made it yesterday and I tasted it and thought it was good.  After letting the flavours blend over night, it is even better.  I did increase the broth and tomatoes by about 1 cup because I like alot of broth. Served with freshly grated parmesan on top! Made for Soup Fest 2011 Event. Thx Paula!"

389660,49252,2009-06-14,4,"We used black forest ham, mushrooms, onion, and laid halved cherry tomatoes on top before baking.  Very tasty dish...even my husband loved it and he doesn't care for quiche.  I think 1 Tbls. of butter would be plenty for the pan.  Ours was a bit greasy.  But still a wonderful and easy recipe!"
47907,342892,2008-12-20,4,"What I like most about these cookies is that they are not as sweet as some other cookies.  Since I made them for Christmas cookies trays, I love having a cookies like that on the tray.  They are super easy to make, too.  I just drizzled mine with a fork dipped in the chocolate.  Thanks for posting!"

570804,160394,2008-09-29,5,Thanks JuliaTN for such a wonderful quiche recipe.  All the foods we love in one dish and I am sure our neighbours could smell the garlic.   The only adjustment I made was to saute the mushrooms and onions.  I use recipe (mine) number 302664 for all quiche or creamy based pies because it does not go soggy.
650758,33489,2009-01-08,5,This is Fantastic! I followed recipe exactly except I used the bag coleslaw mix. and I did not have buttermilk so i just omitted it all together. Very Yummy! Thanks
725368,87748,2008-05-03,5,"Fantastic!  I made stir-fry skirt steak.  I used mirin for the rice wine, beef broth, and about 1 Tbsp of Splenda.  It was very salty - but using low-sodium soy would probably solve that.  As is - made more than enough for my family with lots of extra sauce to pour over rice.  Yum yum yum!!!"
537188,170223,2007-10-09,4,Nice quick breakfast. I obviously didn't put enough yogurt in though because it completely dried out while it was standing for the 30 minutes. I added extra milk when i put the fruit in and it came out fine. Thanks for the recipe!
246482,86727,2010-10-12,5,"This was the first time I made a squash soup and this was easy and oh so good. My husband had never tasted Butternut squash soup and he loved it Easy to make and tastes great.Thanks for posting My husband said"" dont lose the recipe."""
678366,253310,2010-01-23,4,"Good recipe to have! I prefer it with less water, but that's my taste.Great when there's not a lot of time and I need a quick rice dish. I liked the addition of chicken broth.Thanks for sharing."
793440,97365,2008-09-04,5,"WOW!!!! This is a recipe worthy of 10 stars. It tastes like expensive truffles and has the texture of good mousse.  I didn't tell anyone what was in it until after they all were sighing in pleasure and nobody could believe it was tofu. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips since it didn't specify and it has a nice dark chocolate flavor. I wanted to use my new 4 in mini-tart pans, so I just baked regular pie dough in them and filled them with the chocolate filling. Since the filling is so rich I served them with whipped cream on top. This recipe is a definite keeper and I want to experiment with using different liqueurs next time. Maybe some Irish cream or some creme de menth? Mmmmmm.....I can't wait. This is easily my new favorite dessert."
710088,28984,2007-12-31,5,"This is very similar to the recipe from Rosie's Bakery All-Butter, Fresh Cream, Sugar-Packed, No-Holds-Barred Baking Book by Judy Rosenberg.  This recipe is the best!  I have served it plain, with a slight dusting of powdered sugar and with a tart Lemon Butter Mousse with Blueberries."
1230012,79004,2009-05-23,4,"The batter was extremely thick,even though i used 1 1/8 cup of flour.I added 1/4 -1/2 c. water to get it to my liking. With that change it made 8 six inch pancakes. Taste was good,but a tad dry."
95743,118241,2006-09-21,5,"This is an awesome marinade. I ended up marinating for 24+ hrs. I used minimal olive oil so my ""sauce"" was more like a salsa.  No matter-it's all good."
50509,212501,2007-03-11,4,"This turned out delicious, but the sauce was a little thick, not saucy the way I remember it. The Berghoff was the first restaurant I ate at in Chicago, as a preteen visiting for the summer. I have loved creamed spinach since then, and the Berghoff's version is the best. Next time I will add more cream. Be sure to use freshly grated nutmeg - it makes such a difference."
223979,31959,2008-10-21,5,Great little sandwiches!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Very easy and delicious!  Thanks!
126440,32317,2014-10-01,5,This is so yummy.  Loved the mix of flavors from all the ingredients.  Great anytime but served with Best ham sandwich.
65056,79566,2004-09-16,5,"Oh! This was *delicious*!!!  I let the cabbage mix sit in the fridge for a couple hours to let the flavors blend and grilled this on my George Foreman grill.  (I brushed the slices of bread with butter).  Terrific flavor combo- the ham and cabbage mix went fantastically together.  I think this would go well with other cheeses too like swiss or gouda.  The crisp, and tangy/spicy cabbage went wonderfully with the melted cheddar and sweet ham.  I used red cabbage, mango chutney, black forest ham and sourdough rye.  Served with Jamaican Golden Split Pea Soup (#25938), which was a lovely flavor combo.  Wonderful sandwich!  Would definitely make again."
895132,172830,2011-06-03,5,"Wonderful biscotti! I used gluten free flour (1/3 white rice flour, 1/3 sweet rice flour, 1/3 tapioca starch and 1 teaspoon xanthan gum) which worked great, just like the ""normal"" thing. Didn't change anything else and will definitely make them again! Thanks for posting!<br/>Made for ZWT 7 Italy for Count Dracula And His Hot Bites."
370215,90674,2007-06-25,5,"I love this recipe. My VERY picky stepson even ate them well. The mixture will cover much more than 6 pieces of bread generously, so you may want to try it as is before doubling the recipe. My favorite part of this recipe is that the bread didn't come out soggy as some others do."
28177,64376,2003-11-23,5,"Great tasting recipe, MrsEl!  We had two huge bags of fresh green beans from a friend's garden this summer & i collected several recipes to try out with them.  This was by far my favorite. I love raspberry vinegar anyway, but DH doesn't usually.  He did this time!
Thanks again, i'll be keeping this one handy!

2001352464,27208,2017-01-15,0,This is a weight watcher recipe I have been using for years. BEST roast ever!!! I have also substituted a package of Liptons Mushroom Onion dry soup packet for the brown gravy. That is yummy as well!!
1802364480,419935,2014-01-16,0,This soup is AWESOME!  Easy to make and a big hit New Year&#039;s Eve!!
302094,109669,2006-09-07,4,I found this same recipe in taste of home magazine. I made this for church and it was gone with in minutes. Everyone loved it. It is so easy to make and tastes great.
2041451,466455,2011-10-23,5,These are the best rice balls I've ever made. I tried to please my children by leaving out the peas.  It is a mistake peas are a must. I also like to cut up some jalapeÃ±o peppers to make it a little spicy for myself. Love this recipe!
222139,36283,2007-08-19,5,I made this for my DH.  He was iffy but glad I chose to make this for him.  I chose to make this at dinner time then put this in the freezer. To top it off I added some vanilla ice cream to top it off.  Excellant!
86520,66850,2003-11-19,0,I am sorry but these did not have the flaky shortbread that I expected. I thought 2 2/3 cup coconut seemed like a lot so I weighed out 7 oz and it came to just over 2 cups so I went with that. They came out quite hard and I only baked them for 20 min. I won't make them again. 
1914116,252395,2011-12-28,5,amazing recipe good job! just made it tonight and it is better than store bought
142559,107281,2012-09-22,5,"I always order this soup when at restaurants, but have never attempted to make it at home.  Until tonight.  BF had never even heard of it before, but loved it!

237330,217074,2009-07-29,4,When I started to make this dish I was sure I had a lemon in the fridge... no lemon! Still this spinach was wonderful. The sour cream adds a mild tang and one clove of garlic was perfect. Thanks for a great spinach recipe!
1802119886,148385,2014-01-09,0,"This came out moist, tender, nutty, chewy, and made great sandwich bread.  I used almond milk instead of dairy, and melted  coconut oil instead of butter to make this dairy free.  I used the  BASIC 1 1/2 lb setting with dark crust setting on my Hamilton Beach Bread Machine.  I added 1 tsp Vitamin C crystals to the lecithin for extra dough enhancer.  I will definitely make this again.  TASTEY!"
2000225933,85382,2016-04-02,4,Brown sugar is a great rub for pork I have found and the addition of all the herbs made my roast mouthwatering good!  My roast must have been too lean because it didn&#039;t produce drippings so no gravy which would have been better to serve the roast alongside the noodles I cooked..  I served with a Nero d&#039;Avola and the two went well together.
29782,123206,2006-10-24,4,"This was easy to make and turned out great. It reminded DH and I of those Hot Pockets you buy in the store. Great with <a href=""/42395"">Baked Potato Soup</a>  and I used <a href=""/73310"">Crazy John's spicy mustard</a> for the spicy mustard this recipe called for. 
Thanks so much for sharing the recipe. "
468627,175264,2012-06-29,5,This was the most awesome marinade I've ever used on pork chops.  The flavor was fantastic and they were very moist!!  I made the marinade exactly as directed...can't wait to use it on chicken breasts!!!

For the amount of work (much more than 10 minutes for all that washing/chopping) and cost that went into this salad (the basil alone was $3.50 this time of year!) it was not worth it. Again, for the quality of ingredients, the dressing (lemon juice, EVOO, salt, and pepper) is over-simplified and under-powered. The best part was the shaved parmigiano-reggiano cheese!

649322,81419,2008-10-22,5,If I could give it six I would.  This soup is easy to make and very tasty.  This is a new staple in my home.  I made a double batch and will make another this week to freeze.  Thanks for posting!
501654,245475,2008-03-03,4,This was great!  I substitute the Kitchen Bouquet for Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce.  Thanks!
179133,415103,2011-11-19,5,"Mmmmm Tasty is such a good up-and-coming chef! :) I had to use what I had available, which was wheat bread, peanut butter, and honey (in place of the agave). Fabulous sandwich! Thank you Tasty!"
3505,201,2001-06-19,4,"Delicious!  Somewhat of a surprise, as I was not sure how the citrus would react with the Halibut.  Try it with a wild rice recipe or rice pilaf."
39194,52406,2005-07-10,4,I made these as I was wanting nachos and this looked pretty good.  I used the precooked chicken and added some Texas Champagne Hot Sauce to it.  The results were great and I will be trying this with the beef as well.  Nice nacho recipe for something easy and great tasting. :)
250812,143845,2007-08-12,5,"this was sooo good. at first i didn't know if i liked the flavors, but then i couldn't stop eating the skin. then my husband tried it and couldn't believe how good it was. then next night i made more and put it on a whole chicken, and that was just as good. i'll also be using it on just chicken legs. thanks for a great one."
1186623,105141,2010-11-21,5,"I had never brined a chicken before and this was so quick and easy! We've done it several times, both grilling and oven roasting the chicken and it comes out great every time!. I did it per the recipe the first time but now I smash the garlic rather than slice it and I used 1/4 c of regular table salt rather than the kosher. I also only use 2 cups of water but then I added lots of ice to bring it up to 4 cups to cool it off faster. Next time I am going to sub 1 cup of apple juice. Thanks so much!"
182010,284428,2008-04-11,5,"We've had these twice -- once with portabellos and once with creminis.  Fabulous either way.  Thanks, Mandy!"
4470,339988,2009-02-05,5,"Very easy tasty recipe.  I skipped the first braising step, slipped in the broth and baked them for 20 minutes turning them once.  Just right -still had some texture.  Next time I will slice them into 1"" pieces before cooking."
96955,180034,2007-12-17,4,"Mmmm...I really liked this!  I followed the recipe as is except I had to use regular bacon and a 6.5""x10"" baking dish (it was full to the top!).  It was quite easy to make - I cooked the bacon and shredded the cheese the night before so I had less to do in the morning."
29956,25098,2003-01-16,5,"Nice subtle flavours that compliment ""white death"" as my daughter calls cauliflower. She ate it and enjoyed it. Nice and easy as well."
49516,28165,2002-07-18,0,"The recipe sounds great, however, I'm not a rice lover.  For those pasta lovers like myself, try using spaghetti instead of rice.  Jambalaya w/spagheti is great.  The meal is prepared the same, however you use spaghetti.  This dish (spaghetti jambalaya) is great and I would rate this particular dish 5 stars. Try it, I'm sure you'll like it, those in New Orleans do."
76695,42710,2004-06-15,5,"Such an easy and delectable vegetable dish!  It takes a few basic ingredients and makes them special -- and colorful too! We added 1 Tbsp of olive oil for dietary reasons, but it would stand alone just fine."
2176521,273114,2012-02-12,2,"I really, really wanted to rave about this recipe but I found it fairly bland.  I brought one serving to a party and it wasn't in anyway a hit.  I did not deviate from the recipe.  I couldn't help but think that a little white wine for the lighter colored mushrooms or balsamic vinegar for the darker mushrooms would've really pushed the recipe to the next level. Good basic recipe to build upon. Thanks for posting!"
1983265,167136,2011-08-15,5,"When I moved to Idaho I had to leave El Pollo Loco behind : ( I loved the Avacodo Sauce, loved it!!! I tried this recipe and it was JUST like the one they have. Thank you~"
2002246049,92994,2018-08-12,5,"I've made this recipe several times and the family and our friends always love it. It is always fabulous! Occasionally, I add a few other ingredients or substitute something when I'm out of one of the minor ingredients, and it is still excellent. However, the original recipe, unchanged, is always the best!!!"
732283,24378,2012-07-28,5,"We have had this recipe for years, it is one of our favorites, we usually make it like Shelby Jo, but this was just as good hopefully fewer calories, thank you for sharing!"
47892,490440,2013-08-13,5,"I used all the ingredients written but prepared the dish differently. The day before&lt;br/&gt;I cooked the garbanzo beans (and saved some of the liquid). Threw everything in the slow cooker and cooked on HIGH for 1-2 hours then LOW for about 2 more hours. Arranged baby spinach in soup bowls, added a portion of basmati rice, the garbanzo bean mixture, a scoop of&lt;br/&gt;cucumber raita and fresh cilantro for garnish. Yum! Made for Ramadan Tag."
2555346,332140,2012-12-24,0,"Absolutely amazing!!! My mom who is very picky loved it so I am making another one for her.  I added walnuts to it to add just a little bit of crunch, and it was awesome.  Love this recipe:-)"
2002004080,95466,2018-06-16,0,"What kind of onion are we talking about here? White onion, a yellow onion, a Vidalia onion?"
2000357065,63828,2015-07-23,5,"I was skeptical. I was wrong. This was AMAZING. I used a very simple rub, followed another reviewer and cut 1 inch holes over the loin that I stuffed with chopped garlic. Avocado oil drizzled on top, along with 21 spice blend and paprika and called it. Next time I&#039;m gonna try to  marinate the pork first for a few hours. Mind blown."
269521,330932,2008-11-04,3,"I made the recipe as written, using dried beans (soaked for approximately 10 hours).  Unfortunately, at the end of 8 hours the beans were still 'crunchy' and the barley was overcooked.   However, It did have good flavor so think that you're on the right track.   Would suggest making it clear in the description or title as to whether the recipe is intended as a soup or side dish."
140132,75202,2009-09-29,4,"I really liked this, as I am a blue cheese LOVER!!!  I never thought of adding it to veggies other then salads.  I really liked this so much , the kids were a little squeemish at first, since the cheese is so sharp but they came around and enjoyed it too.  I plan on making this sometime during the holidays while my family is home, they will LOVE it too."
21752,20077,2002-02-24,5,"I love this cake!  The house smelled wonderful while I was boiling the oranges!  It's very easy, has no flour (perfect for Passover), the only fat comes from the egg yolks and the almonds, and it's delicious.  I made this for dessert last night and it got rave reviews from family and guests.  I made my own simple icing from powdered sugar and orange juice.  There's only one piece left and guess what I'm having for breakfast tomorrow morning!"
1800054678,515466,2015-09-13,5,"This is such a good idea to decorate your house for holidays. I had fun making these. The candles really boost the fall and holiday atmosphere in my house. In addition to the citrus fruit, I used a few fake leaves to give the candles more content. Didn&#039;t have hot glue, but super glue worked fine for me. I will probably leave the candles around in the house for as long as possible. They are so pretty! Thank you Jolie for this amazing recipe!"
65197,102830,2005-09-23,5,"I didn't have crystalized ginger, I used fresh instead of the powdered...and chopped some fresh sage
OH my goodness the results are fabulous!
(I was cleaning out my Asian supplies and fried up a couple of left over egg roll wrappers to top off soup!
Thank you for the recipe!"
267125,81406,2005-11-24,4,"Very easy, very tasty.  I was out of ground ginger & substituted 2tbsp fresh grated ginger.  Also opted to use a mix of brown rice syrup & honey in place of molasses.  Chopped bits of candied ginger sprinkled on top made a great addition."
1009143,352781,2012-01-08,0,Just leave them on the cookie sheet to cool a bit and then you will have one deli-sh cookie!
2000130290,235402,2015-04-10,0,unbelievable salty!!! had to throw away
339025,344648,2009-12-26,3,"I made this with the chocolate chips, but think I will omit them next time. The ""dough"" was pretty wet and I would not recommend using a spoon to push the dough down as it tends to stick to the spoon. My advice would be to put a small amount of butter or oil on your fingertips and form the cookies that way."
791407,17962,2009-07-24,5,"This dish was great!  My 5 & 3 year olds loved it =) Hubby loved it too! They ate it right up.  I, like others, did the pocket in the breast instead of pounding it out worked out fine.  Did have to increase the time a bit.  Still turned out great!"
681167,105545,2007-12-09,5,Great balance of flakiness and sturdiness. This is the ONLY pie crust recipe that I like.
1320105,27999,2009-08-06,4,"You can't go too wrong with  peanut butter and chocolate so I was excited to try this recipe.  These were quite good and all five of my children liked them.  Somehow, I don't think of these as breakfast muffins but more like a dessert; although, they are quite filling.  I made 12 regular size muffins and baked for 20 minutes.  They came out perfect.  I also used regular size chocolate chips.  I think I will be packing some in lunchboxes soon."
852554,329774,2010-07-02,5,Yummy!  I like the pineapple juice with the creme de cassis... Also liked it with vodka! Made for ZWT #6!
611441,152170,2008-12-19,5,"Awesome recipe. Tasty, juicy and amazing! It was great on rice. Next time I make it I will go to the local store and pick up some roti shells to serve it on."
1802636976,514965,2014-04-02,5,Awesome!
313943,114392,2011-08-02,5,"I doubled the recipe for my large family, and I'm so glad I did. This was easy to make and made a perfect pizza!"
1663989,155021,2011-01-25,0,"Very similar to Alton Brown's wing recipe, except he steams the wings first instead of boiling.  It's my 'go to' recipe for gatherings!"
36944,139135,2006-04-04,5,I made it early in the day and it was very eaasy to prepare. I used a mixture of fat free milk and fat free half and half.  I also subbed the fontina cheese with provolone because that's what I had.   I added some more half and half before baking it.  The result was a nice creamy mac and cheese entree!  A great flavor with the added bonus of being low fat.  Thank you for sharing your recipe lovetacook!
676702,226968,2008-09-26,5,"I can't compare this to the original as I haven't tried it, but this recipe is VERY good! I cooked this using 6 ounces of olive oil with 2 tablespoons of butter. It turned out a bit more oily than I expected and will reduce it by a 1/4 cup. The overall flavor was wonderful and will be making this one again and again."
157080,65347,2010-02-21,5,"OMG! This recipe is wonderful! I've tried so many frozen coffee recipes and they never seem to suite my tastes, but this one is perfect! Its so versatile and you can even make it sugar-free and fat-free without losing the taste. I'm a nurse that works night shift and I am always looking for recipes to help keep myself and my co-workers awake on those long 12 hour shifts. This will definitely be a new addition to the unit to keep us awake and buzzed. Thank you soo much!"
122001,10478,2005-01-30,5,I too liked it.  I can stop looking for a bread recipe.  I used butter instead lard.  Lard is too expensive.  The only problem is it makes so much; however after the first taste I don't think it will be enough.
1706068,118361,2010-10-16,0,I found that the egg whites would not thicken
513305,142325,2008-01-29,5,"I think it's curious that the poster of this recipe describes it as Australian. To me, it seems it's influence is Thai. Anyway, I have made this following the recipe, which was very good as is, but I wound up altering it to suit my tastes the last couple times I made it. I must stress that the original recipe is delicious but I prefer more flavor. Heres what I have done if anyone's interested. I always use chicken broth instead of water. I also add 1 tablespoon of brown sugar (trust me on this) and a few squirts of fish sauce. At the end, I like to stir in a little torn fresh basil, which gives it a wonderful, bright flavor. Also, I have used chicken instead of shrimp, which is excellent as well."
223854,111661,2007-07-08,5,"I made this for *Zaar World Tour III* - I followed the recipe but had to substitute the dark corn syrup to honey because I couldn't find it in our region, the guys had this on there steaks tonight and I had mine on my chicken.  We all really enjoyed it.  Thank you Dreamgoddess (aka Naughty But Nice Gang Captian)"
170359,10404,2007-08-08,4,Very good and quick!
114027,313834,2008-08-01,4,"I cut the tomatoes into wedges and tossed them in with some angel hair pasta and served as a room temerature pasta salad. I used the marinade as the sauce, and it turned out great. I felt they were much better the first day because they got a little too mushy for me by the next day. But the flavor was wonderful and I will use them again."
283251,243205,2007-08-03,3,"This was good, but I think I overdid it on the shallots... Next time, more butter and less shallots!"
1943764,456,2011-06-28,5,my favorite dal recipe.  the best
804794,19101,2008-04-02,0,"I like the buttermilk in your recipe. it really makes a different. I spread nutella on them, then fold it, add fresh fruits, drizzle with chocolate syrup, sprinkle with powder sugar and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Delicious!"
122595,258754,2009-09-22,5,"Sooo good and its a no brainer kind of dessert.  I might just cut back a little tiny bit on the butter...but otherwise perfect.  My dh loved it, my ds who does not like sweets (can he be my son???) liked it, only my youngest didn't like it, but he won't eat anything with cooked fruit ever...so I don't even count that vote.  This is DELICIOUS...I only wish we had had some french vanilla ice cream to go with it...oh well next time...8 )   thanks so much for sharing"
169774,87782,2006-11-19,5,THese potatoes were a snap to make and were really super yummy - perfect for fall!
494068,186965,2009-05-01,5,"This bacon is just the thing to serve when you want something special for breakfast, or when you have company.  Goes great with just about any other breakfast item!  I loved the flavor of the bacon and I think you will too!"
416985,272045,2009-08-11,5,"We really enjoyed this. I doubled the italian seasoning and used shredded mozarella. If you rinse the pasta can out, be sure to cook the meat sauce down. I didn't, and that was my fiance's only complaint. But my EXTREMELY picky DD loved it! Thanks.."
115758,94670,2006-09-09,5,"Fantastic...I added lots of freshly ground black pepper and some sea salt flakes to the top of each Bruscetta. The addition of lemon juice was new to me and I loved it!
Thanks for sharing."
407207,10075,2009-08-31,5,"I loved this recipe!!  Easy and the smell was great in the kitchen.  My whole family loved it and requested it again!  My girls are 8 and 10!  We love garlic, so I added more!  Yummy!"
1562407,264506,2010-02-24,4,"This was very tasty!  I made it in a 10-inch springform pan and used the maximum amount of cooking time and it turned out nicely.  It probably needed several hours to cool, but I only had about 90 minutes so I put it in the refrigerator and that did the trick.  My can of pineapple yielded 1 cup of juice so I did not use the water, and I used unsweetened applesauce.  I would make this again when cooking for vegans or if I wanted a lower-fat cake!"
2002043605,52999,2018-03-11,3,"These were waaaay too salty. I made a batch and after cooking my test pancake (which I always do) nearly gagged. I made a new batch without salt and combined them and they were much better. For our family, the recipe should halve both the salt and the sugar. Otherwise, they were quite yummy. Even a 1/4 tsp of salt would probably be fine."
174096,89066,2009-02-10,5,Unique and delicious flavors!  Very easy to prepare and enjoyable.  Thanks for sharing!
2221308,111951,2014-11-09,5,Made this with Vanilla rum and served over vanilla ice cream. Simply wonderful.
130663,59668,2006-06-11,5,Lovely rice pudding.Hubbies favorite.Will make again.
433225,178075,2007-11-07,3,"I didn't get a crisp light batter, rather a thick doughy batter that never got crisp. Tasted a little ""Pancakey"". After adding Garlic Oregano, and more salt, the taste was ok, just not crispy. Fried it more, but not there."
895132,326682,2014-02-24,5,"OMG this was truly amazing! I can&#039;t believe I didn&#039;t make it before, I had it in my to try folder for ages. The only thing I changed was to omit the onion powder, otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. So easy and yummy. We both loved it. Will make it again often. Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for Healthy Choices Tag Game."
189674,83356,2009-01-03,5,"So my wife really didn't care for this dish, but I absolutely loved it... I guess it goes on the ""list to make when mom's away"".  The fruit and zip mixed just right and everything turned out great.  In the directions it talks about ""a good aroma comes from the pan"", you'll know when it's time - the aroma is awesome!"
579630,10785,2009-08-05,4,I made this for dinner last night and it was wonderful. I have never ate spaghetti squash before. I was amased at the interesting texture and how much it was like pasta. The sauce was perfect and I was thrilled with how many vegtables this added to my dayily count. Thanks for this keeper.
147095,101971,2004-11-10,5,"With a few alterations due to ingredient availability in my pantry, this soup was outstanding! I had no sun-dried tomatoes or jalapenos, so I used tomato paste and chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, which gave the soup a smoky, spicy, sneak-up-on-you kind of heat that the adults loved and the kids drank lots of milk with! I pureed about 2/3 of the soup, because I wanted a little bit of texture, and served with shredded cheddar and sour cream. It was a huge hit with my family and best friend who dropped by the next day! The spiciness dropped after overnight refrigeration, leaving a mellow, low heat--perfect! I tripled the recipe and froze some for a lazy day."
1699397,391984,2010-12-28,5,These were great! I wished I had made more!
428885,307917,2008-12-05,5,"Great dressing, loved the fact this was really chilled, because I had prepared this yesterday. I followed this exactly, except for the chili sauce, (thought I had some in fridge, but didn't, so made a mixture 1part ketchup to 1part creamy horseradish) in place of the chili sauce. I served on top of iceburg lettuce wedge and some cucumber. Very tasty, and so great I could of taken a spoon and eaten it right from the bowl. Thanks Lavender Lynn!"
597538,254778,2008-06-09,5,This is the best flavored steak I have ever had I think!  The marinade was just right for steak and the flavors in this steak were to simply die for!!!  I can't wait to have it again and my mom and dad and rest of the family ate until they were about ready to pop!  This is better than in a lot of the restaurants and especially good with the flavors that only the grill can give!  EXCELLENT!
58104,341581,2010-04-19,5,"I made this in a bean crock. Holding in more moisture seeing an other reviewer found it to dry out. I did use 3 cans of beans. Also used whole grain mustard didn`t have dry. Baked and tasted found it wsn`t sweet enough for DH added 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1/4 cup ketchup.  Used smoked chipotle for a smoky kick. No it isn`t the same baked beans the onions on top really make this tasty! Thanks."
1609858,259769,2014-02-04,4,"Easy and does taste like a Cakester.  The cookies are VERY soft though, which makes them a little challenging to frost, but yummy."
117438,92096,2004-06-18,5,"This was fabulously easy. I used 3 410g cans tomato puree and 2 400g cans diced italian tomatoes. I made a slight error, by adding too much sugar (woops) but it was wonderful nonetheless. Next time I will measure it out with a spoon..  "
1372737,305739,2009-09-02,0,"Wow, this was superb!  My man, my five and seven year old daughters and I loved this rice dish!!!  Thanks!!"
2001910310,216237,2018-01-03,5,Seriously tasty.Easy and healthy(ish).
340438,203925,2007-05-15,1,"Sorry, the garlic was WAY overpowering to us. My stomach hurt after this one."
76535,72506,2003-10-16,4,"This was very good. I left out the anchovies (I don't like them) and the red pepper flakes (because of my 2 year old), and it was still good."
400708,402866,2017-10-17,4,"Very good and good instructions, I do think next time I'd use cream as Papa D stated for added creaminess. This time I made as directed and it was thick and creamy and enjoyed by all."
39835,120300,2006-02-27,5,Very good and easy--these do make a lot of meatballs--we had these over pasta tonight and we're freezing some for meatball sandwiches later in the week. The changes I made was using ground beef (instead of the veal) and using oyster and regular mushrooms (instead of wild mushrooms). I also really liked the no-watch method of cooking these meatballs in the oven--super easy and almost no work! Thanks for sharing!
152995,100999,2006-07-04,5,Excellent! It was just my dad and me home for a whole week and he wanted something sweet. I didn't want to bake up a whole pan of brownies so made these instead! They were fantastic and just the right amount! Thankyou so much!
275926,15773,2008-06-16,5,"Delicious!!  My husband went to culinary arts school and  this recipe earned me the remark ""it is perfectly seasoned.""  I was craving teriyaki chicken last night but didn't have any sauce.  This was PERFECT for us!  I want to make it again tonight. :)"
67335,70605,2004-06-27,5,"I rated this 5 stars because I know it would've been better if I made with 1/2 margarine but didn't have any so I made them with all butter. Otherwise, I really liked their thickness and they taste very good! Thank you for sharing this great recipe!"
5060,35027,2002-09-05,4,"This was very good, cut the recipe in half for supper tonight, the previous review was right, I too had to cook it for about 25 minutes, it could have been the thickness of the fillet. Lovely taste, the only change I made was to leave out the green pepper,because I made a rice pilaf to go with the cod and it had green pepper in it.  The tomatoes, onions and basil complimented the cod. We will do it again, thanks for sharing!!"
107135,149514,2005-12-29,5,ive had these at parties to they are very good   a slice of orange is also nice dee
67899,124391,2005-06-25,5,"This is so refreshing! It's like a combination of lemonade and iced tea. I chose to use ginseng and peppermint teas, and the flavor turned out fantastic. I think I may take Evelyn's advice and reduce the sugar slightly next time, though, because it almost tastes a little sweeter than it needs to be. But there will definitely be many next times! I'm planning on making sure I have this on hand in my refrigerator this summer!"
95502,98197,2004-11-18,5,This is a great recipe - quick & easy to throw together and it really is something different from the norm.  I think it would be great with some jalepenos and onions thrown in too!  DH absolutely loved it and I plan to work it in to our regular menu.  Thanks for sharing!
1165778,31128,2009-02-14,5,"Mmm, fantastic!!

I made my own crust, with almond flour in it, and it went really well together.

The only thing I would change is I would leave off the pecans next time. They were too crunchy in my opinion, although I was the only one in my family who thought so.

Thank you for sharing your recipe, Wendy! I'll definitely be making it again!"
579760,23922,2008-03-11,5,I love this recipe.  I make it all the time. The only change I make is to use real garlic and I make it with red potatoes that I cut into quarters. Delish!
386849,22493,2007-01-30,5,Everyone loved this! I made it several times over the summer.  I used a graham cracker crust that I made from recipe #7537 by Pamela in Winnipeg.  Thanks a million for posting!
128473,184501,2006-11-20,5,Really nice soup Lainey6605. It was quick and easy to make. A real comfort soup. Perfect for our cold dreary day. I used red peppers and penne because thats what was in the pantry. The sausage blended perfectly with the herbs. Thanks for sharing this new family favourite.
2158358,11028,2012-01-25,4,"I made these last night. I followed the recipe except I popped them into a crock pot with spaghetti sauce instead of using broth.  I am a real meat lover and these were great compared to a ""real"" meatball! Texture wise they were awesome, they even LOOK like a meatball. HOWEVER....they were salty...a bit too salty. I think next time instead of a onion soup mix, I will try maybe onion powder and season the breadcrumbs myself. Maybe next time the kids will actually eat them!"
1071298,189955,2010-03-07,5,"I can not BELIEVE I found this recipe! I also lived in Squamish, B.C. and have since moved. I was sitting here talking to my husband about how much I missed this crazy good soup from this brewery. Thought I`d look for a recipe to try and duplicate it. Well you can imagine my pleasure and surprise to find THE recipe! THANK-YOU for saving and posting this recipe!"
678366,15553,2010-01-28,5,"I really enjoyed the clove in this. Never had tea with clove. Served it hot,cold,with and without milk.All Great! I used cinnamon pieces. Thanks for sharing !"
346221,53620,2010-01-11,5,"I like Puttanesca and when I saw this recipe for Garlic Lovers I just had to try it. I made the sauce as stated, but was very tempted to add tomato sauce or pasta sauce for a more gravy consistency. I am glad that I stuck with the recipe as written. I mixed my sauce with Cavatappi pasta and the next day the sauce flavors were wonderful with the pasta. Maybe next time I'll add some tomato sauce for a change up, then again maybe not..."
318711,27208,2012-07-09,5,This is a great receipe!  Tastes great and is so easy to make!  <br/>Thanks for sharing!!
524350,247096,2007-09-04,4,Easy dish to make and my entire family loved it.
1609326,110458,2013-07-06,5,"When I was looking for an enchilada recipe I originally skipped over this one because I&#039;m not a fan of cafeterias and the Luby&#039;s part was a turn off.  But, when I couldn&#039;t find anything that looked better I decided to try it and I&#039;m so glad I did!  I live in Tex-Mex heaven and expect a lot from my Mexican food.  This recipe did not disappoint.  The only change I made is I browned an extra half pound of hamburger meat and made one pan filled with beef and one with cheese.  Oh, and I also used half cheddar cheese and half shredded American because I love the creaminess of the American. My whole family enjoyed them!"
383346,188041,2008-02-18,5,"I used parmesan cheese, grated.  Maybe that's why I didn't have a crust on them.  But it's ok it was still delicious.  Delicious.  Thanks Kit :)  Made for 123 hit wonders"
845315,108248,2008-12-23,5,"Fantastic recipe. I couldn't bring myself to make another batch of cookies late one pre-Christmas night and found this recipe. I baked in a 9x13 glass pan, reduced the temp by 10 degrees and 25 minutes was just right. Another reviewer was correct, these are like Blondies! I had some leftover butterscotch chips so I tossed them in too. I let cool completely and they cut up beautifully for my cookie trays. A keeper for sure!
UPDATE: Gave these in a cookie tray to a favorite bartender, MISTAKE!! Now I am on my third batch for all the people she shared them with, lol.  Double the vanilla and bake on parchment paper to easily lift from the pan. Perfect Perfect Perfect!!"
14613,7645,2001-12-03,4,a good way to put a little extra kick into a broccoli side dish.  i added some cherry tomatoes to the mix.
126440,123526,2010-08-12,5,Made half a recipe for two chicken breast halves and worked out great.  I only had lemon juice but worked fine.  Used in Recipe #12701.
91392,45497,2006-09-04,4,"Great stuff with so few, and such cheap ingredients.  I did add a bit more water, which I then cooked off, to avoid sticking.  I served this with Chinese noodles, but it would also be good with regualr pasta and a green vegetable, or amybe even with mashed potatoes.  You need to like onions to like it, but it is a winner."
286566,68955,2007-01-11,5,"Thank you to Tomoko and her mum.  I doubled the recipe and didn't quite leave a enough time for cooking (we ate a little late), served with rice and steamed vegetables, delicious.  They are even good the next day cold - good for a picnic."
333017,16705,2010-05-30,4,"I sprinkled the ribs first with Recipe #62779 then added Bull's Eye BBQ sauce, diluted with some water..then let them cook on low for 8 hours.  We went over to a friends place for a pot luck dinner and they were enjoyed by all.  I would definately do this recipe again!!!  Thanks for an easy posting!!!"
1364452,44887,2011-12-10,5,"Thank you!  It was something that my stepson and I totally enjoyed for an easy dinner.  I've had a craving for nachos, and this helped.  Thank you!"
14987,164367,2007-11-22,5,"glad to see, try  with  wojapi fruit  berry sauce   use frozen  any mixture  on stove top or microwave.  leave space because will  expand when boiling   sugar, honey, maple syrup or no sweetner   may add cranberries in season or lemon juice  to give it tartness  pour over  i.f.b. otmeal or ice ream .   pronounced woe - cha pea   accent on second  syllable. thanks"
73836,64513,2004-11-03,5,"Made this today for our dinner and it was lovely.  I had bought a huge piece of Scottish Organic salmon and wanted to use a recipe that would do it justice. I certainly made the right choice with this one.  The sauce was gorgeous!  My husband had two helpings!  This is a real keeper, thanks!"
131126,211602,2007-03-18,5,"I had great luck with this recipe and liked the results. The flavor of the filling was pleasing and didn't scream of lentils or have a mushy texture. I did make a few changes to the recipe to use what I had on hand that day. I added: a bit of montreal seasoning, used canned tomatoes (drained), instant potatoes, and 1 cup frozen mixed veggies instead of carrots. After baking I am glad I used the frozen veggies for the additional color. I found the amount of jalapeno perfect... not too hot, but still gave a pleasant lift to the recipe. I made this in two loaf pans instead of the 9x13 pan so I could bake one & freeze one. Good luck in the contest!"
1892740,104022,2012-09-04,5,Yummy and perfectly moist! :)
537400,332873,2008-11-11,5,I quadrupled the recipe and used velveeta cheese and cheddar cheese.  I also used half and half and whipping cream instead of milk.  The soup was delicious.  I used four cups of broccoli but it could stand about another 1 or 2 cups since it is mashed before putting in the liquid.  Very easy recipe.  I will definitely make again.
530085,121648,2007-07-12,5,"Fantastic! I used dark molasses brown sugar, it came out great. As Lvs2Cook stated, I needed to double the recipe to make a quart, but all in all, I was surprised at the subtle flavors released.  Next time though, I think I will add the pecans to the bubble mixture to help release some more pecan flavor, strain it, then add them once again when the mixture hardens in the machine.  Thanks for the post."
471700,263336,2010-06-06,5,This cake was the very best I have tasted in a long time and really easy to make.  Thank you for the recipe.  I made one chage I use framboise liquer.
415204,9050,2007-03-21,5,Super..Just like we have at the Parke County Covered Bridge..will now be able to this recipe more than once a year..Thanks
302689,347977,2009-09-12,5,"This run was fantastically quick and easy, so much so that I thought it was going to be a bit 'dull'. I am very happy to report that I was wrong! I quartered the recipe and used it as a kind of 'shake and bake' for roasted root vegetables (Beetroot, Swede, Carrot and Parsnip) I used a combo of smoked and mild paprika and had plenty left over for another round of delicious roast veggies! Thanks for posting Nif. Made for PAC Fall '09"
671893,35805,2009-03-22,5,The bread was perfect! I did use rapid rise yeast tho because thats all i had. so I took the dough out 10 minutes earlier from the breadmaker so that it doest over-rise. The consistensy of the dough was perfect! thanks for a great recipe!
354465,178901,2007-03-27,5,These burgers were very good. I didn't add the Clubhouse Steakhouse Pepper Seasoning because I wasn't sure if you meant something like Montreal seasoning or some other type of seasoning so I just used black pepper but only about 1/4 tsp. I would definately make these again. I made four patties and added a slice of cheese to them just before I finished cooking them then topped with our favorite toppings. They were a little delicate so I had to be careful when flipping them but I liked that they had flavor without it being too overpowering. It was just right for us. Thank's!
1445088,141983,2012-01-17,5,This was absolutely delicious. Didn't have any parmesan & I added a few dashes of nutmeg & salt. It was so creamy and rich. This will now be my go to alfredo. Even my kids loved it. Thank you.
87023,31286,2004-08-03,5,"Loved this recipe, I actually used red potatoes and left skin on and chopped up 3 green onions.  I do think the cilantro makes this along with the garlic, and I love both.  I will do my potato salad this way in future, better than boiled potatoes anytime."
293946,327776,2009-04-17,5,"Well I made this recipe for the 2009 Spring PAC.  I made this with 1 cup of un-popped popcorn.  I did not measure it after it was popped.  I truthfully figured that it was close enough.  LOL  I made this and honestly, I was a little unsure about it.  I figured ""No way this is going to cover all this popcorn.""  Yet I have to say that it did.  I truly enjoyed it.  It had a Caramel taste to it.  It was extremely easy and had no problems with it.  I have to say this is a definite Movie Time Kudos Keeper!!  Two Thumbs Up!!"
394288,158440,2006-12-24,5,LOVED this recipe. Really hearty soup. The many textures makes this a quick treat. I now make this at least once a week. I ADORE it. Even started adding my own touches to it like some bacon for extra flavor and different variances of spagetti sauce. Thanks for posting this fab recipe!
1185672,26723,2009-02-27,5,I make this dish for my family at least once a month or more. This recipe is very similar to mine only I double the recipe and use a 9X13 pan. My picky children love it and ask for it over and over.
183098,158591,2016-02-08,5,"Wow, this was great.  Made it for Super Bowl, followed the recipe very closely, the only difference being I used roasted red peppers in place of the bell pepper, and slightly less brown sugar.  Very easy and tasty -- served on nice rolls with coleslaw.  Thank you for sharing!"
487641,101132,2007-04-22,3,"These were ok.  Not quite what I was looking for, but my daughter really liked them.  The batter is on the thin side, but the didn't stick at all and they cooked up with a nice golden color.  I think probably just not to my taste."
1244997,429569,2010-06-13,5,"This review is for the sauce only. I halved this recipe and kept the brown sugar (I used all light brown sugar with about 1/2 c molasses for a bit more depth) at the same amount of 2 cups. Used for my smoked ribs, this bbq recipe is Kick'n good...like can't wait to use it again good. Even though I only made half this recipe I still have about 1 1/2 c left to make some chicken with it this week.
Definitely a keeper!"
1862801,249147,2011-03-23,5,This recipe was easy and turned out great.  I browned the bratwurst first and left them whole then added the rest of the ingredients( including garlic). I used plain tomatoes and my own seasonings instead. The kids even ate it.
599450,503093,2013-08-11,5,"Made as directed in the rice cooker -- all the way! That made this so easy! Great comfort food! Thanks, Dienia! Made for ZWT9, team Gourmet Goddesses."
157425,68226,2005-12-15,5,I enjoyed this soup so much!! Have been sick and this tasted very good. I also added some garlic and a leek when frying the hamburger. So quick and easy but taste's like good old fashioned home made soup. 
2726970,302004,2013-03-08,0,Disappointed. I followed this recipe to a T and they came out dry and they werent very chocolatey. Needed more cocoa.
2725239,449809,2014-04-21,5,"I made a half-recipe and it was as good as to be expected.  However, it does take long to prepare.  I did make some substitutions; cream of mushroom, pre-seasoned (chicken flavor) stuffing, and beef broth.  Will make it again!"
2000057084,293243,2015-03-28,1,"I just don&#039;t understand why this websites gives out the worst recipes ever. you expect me to roll out pancake batter? I followed the recipe word from word and I got pancake batter, not a structured soft dough."
1623620,29301,2017-06-04,4,"Very good for homemade Indian food! It was just a tad spicy for our tastes, but the flavor was definitely there. I think I will only add half the cayenne next time. I also omitted the raisins-not a big fan. The yogurt complimented perfectly, however, I don't think the cilantro made a big difference, so I probably won't bother with it next time. Adding it to our Favorites Cookbook. :)"
128473,37187,2004-07-11,5,Thank you for sharing your recipe RB we really enjoyed the cookies. The were nice and crunchy on the outside and very chewy inside. The flavour of the maraschino cherry shone in this cookie.I will certainly be making these again.
576855,29210,2008-02-03,3,"It was good, but not quite as sweet as what I'm used to.  I think I'm going to experiment with the sauce, adding more sugar or maybe honey to get the sweet-hot taste I like.  
One word of caution, don't lean over the wok when adding the green onions!  I was coughing for half an hour from the chili steam I accidentally inhaled."
1161734,196167,2009-02-16,0,"I make make this all the time, but instead of cream of mushroom soup. I use cream of celery."
127971,146361,2005-11-27,5,I have been making this fudge for over 25 yrs. Still have the original recipe cut from a magazine. You can also put fudge in frig for a short time until starting to set. Line a large pie plate with buttered foil & mound fudge in wreath shape with spoon.  Refrigerate again til set. Very creamy. Everyone loves it.
23542,13699,2001-11-13,5,This is one of my families favorite treats and one of the easiest recipes I have ever made.  It is no fail.  I used to make it every christmas.  We moved about 5 years ago and I lost the recipe.  I have been looking for it ever since.  Thank you so much.
2707451,75302,2013-02-23,0,"This was terrific!  I used Angel Hair Pasta and mixed the soup with the pasta, it is really good-enjoy!"
173314,33869,2005-01-23,5,My family liked these. So easy to prepare...might use a 9 x 7 pan next time to make a little thicker.
95743,259786,2008-02-17,5,"Now this is one outstanding recipe.  27*, duonyte.  I roasted three 2"" beets and used 1/2 of the dressing recipe.  That glaze truly is divine.  Now I wish I had made the full recipe so that I could try it on sweet potatoes and chicken breasts.  I'll do it anyway.  Inspired combination."
303162,99103,2006-11-12,5,"Yum! Fabulous and easy, my favorite kind of recipe. :) I made it with 1/2 T of salt, all else as directed. Thank you for sharing!"
330545,306714,2008-06-10,5,"I agree, this is a very refreshing drink and one was sufficient for me!  Made for ZWT4."
47892,157674,2010-10-21,4,My husband and I both liked this salad. I used pom seeds and grapes and the apple of choice was honeycrisp. The nutmeg was a delicious addition to the dressing. Reviewed for Veg Tag October.
294255,139874,2010-03-19,5,"Loved the change from Brats with beer! The onions had a wonderful flavor. We used sweet onions instead of red, because thats what we had on hand. They turned out great with the marinade! Thanks so much for the recipe!"
1200752,344336,2014-04-05,5,"My son loves this!  We are both big fans, it is delicious!  The bouillon cubes really make the dish tasty, but not overpowering.  Very easy to cook, and plenty of leftovers, when you&#039;re only serving two.  It also reheats very well!"
145375,156586,2006-12-22,5,"This is the very first OAMC recipe I prepared and served. I used  great white beans instead of kidneys and bow ties instead of penne, because that is what I had on hand. My whole family enjoyed this, it was hearty and comforting on a cold winter night. Thanks for posting this."
308765,132052,2006-09-23,0,"I wanted to make a comment that Ziploc and Reynold's both do not recommend using their bags for boiling.  Hopefully there would be no ill effects but the bag will melt slightly in boiling water (even the freezer bags) and plastic could leech into your food causing potential carcinogens.

I found this article at sacbee.com that claims Rival Seal a Meal one-quart vacuum storage bags and Food Saver VacLoc Vacuum Packaging Bags are both safe for boiling, it will say so on the box.  These are a lot more expensive ($8-$10) but worth it for the fun!  Also worth it because I don't want to get stuck with cleanup!  I'm going to use this recipe when I go camping with 10 of my closest buddies."
236742,53643,2005-08-23,5,"I had this in the WINDWARD mall in Hawaii, probably not the best but they was good. I would say go with the pork for sure, this is very good, I did increase the garlic and mushroom. Thanks for the recipe"
1592590,307235,2010-04-17,4,the family says definitely make it again!  Thanks for posting...
286566,482400,2012-07-15,5,"I scaled this back for 1 serve and was only using 1 pan so I cooked up my zucchini first (left skin on) and then drained that on paper towel and cleaned out pan and then cooked up the onion and garlic amd then proceded as per recipe from step 4 for what was a delicious breakfast though I found the addition of lemon juice strange it was quite pleasant with the zucchini and onion and the herbs.  Thank you Baby Kato, made for Went To Market tag game."
339260,221705,2008-07-14,5,"Very good and easy pie recipe.  I made this to take to my in-laws.  My FIL says that he doesn't like cream cheese so I substituted the tsp of milk in the cream cheese with a dollop of whipped cream and added a Tbsp of sugar.  The pie turned out great.  My in-laws enjoyed it and my FIL never even noticed the cream cheese.  LOL  Thanks for sharing a great summer pie recipe.  Made for July, 2008 Bevy Tag."
14410,204124,2007-01-15,3,"Good flavor, but they stuck to the foil. I ended up wasting a lot trying to peel them off. If I make them again, I'll just spray the pan instead of using the foil."
2001290001,77585,2016-12-10,5,"I make this soup every week. My daughter loves it! I am a cajun, so I never measure anything except the spices. I use larger amounts of the vegetables. I usually triple the seasoning since I always make more than the original recipe due to the added vegetables. I don't usually put the pasta because we like to stay lower carb. I do always use 1/2 to 1 cup of Chinati wine which gives it a nice flavor. My daughters are soooo happy I found this recipe. A large pot never last more than a few days in my house."
857489,80931,2008-12-05,4,"Very good and easy. I added about 4 cloves minced garlic and 2 extra carrots to this.I used canned mushrooms because I didn't have any fresh and I used a white onion instead of the green.I followed the recipe the rest of the way, using the red wine(Burgundy), and added in some worcestershire sauce too.Served over buttered egg noodles and sprinkled with fresh minced parsley and sourdough rolls on the side. My husband liked it very much. Yummy meal on a chilly night. Thank you very much for sharing! I will make this again."
2002239789,240324,2018-08-05,5,Came out great! Thanks
482405,218410,2007-04-12,5,I found this recipe in the Taste of Home Magazine and made it for Easter....it was a huge hit and it wasn't that difficult to make.  It is definitely a keeper.
1800546044,17316,2013-12-08,0,"Absolutely delicious! I could not believe how yummy this was (and couldn&#039;t stop eating). For me, 2 peaches equalled roughly 1 cup. I used 10 peaches and 2 nectarines, because I ran out of peaches. Couldn&#039;t notice anything. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next time though, I would add less sugar. Plus ice-cream goes beautifully with it."
1295285,183334,2009-07-22,5,"I love this dish!  The only things I changed were to substitue some chopped mint leaves for the rosemary and new baby potatoes for the carrots.  

It was really good the first day but the leftovers were even better!!  A definite keeper.  Thanks for sharing."
383346,242319,2010-07-01,5,"I couldn't find garlic and cheese flavored croutons so I made this recipe with garlic flavored croutons.  I used low-fat mozzarella cheese.  I'm sure it would have been better with fresh mozzarella.  At the last minute, I decided to use balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  And I used fresh basil and put it in the oven until melted.  Thanks Lainey.  This is so tasty.  A great appetizer :)  Made for PRMR tag game"
710155,296692,2012-08-19,5,"Excellent as written.  I've reviewed this before but now I want to include these notations for my own later use.  I use boneless, skinless thighs, chunked and not flattened, or chicken breasts as directed, but I have also used pork tenderloin medallions and they are excellent also (my husband's favorite!).  I put this together differently because I want lots of sauce for angel hair pasta and I have been working on that and finally got it to my satisfaction, and in doing that I also modified the ingredients.    I used about 3 T of my homemade parsley pesto with a little roasted garlic olive oil and added about 3 T refrigerated minced garlic, and about 8 very large sliced mushrooms in a skillet, and sauteed until the mushrooms were tender.  Then I removed the mushroom mixture, putting about 2/3 of the mushroom mixture (reserving the remainder) in a saucepan and added to that a mixture or 1 C chicken broth and 1 tsp cornstarch, and 1/4 C Marsala and a sprinkle of smoked kosher salt and brought it to a boil until thickened and then added about 2 T heavy cream and 2 sliced green onions, heated well and turned off the burner.  Meanwhile I proceeded to follow this Skillet recipe pretty much as written, just adding back the already sauteed mushrooms where the fresh ones would be added.  To serve I put the cooked pasta in a pasta dish, topped with the sauce and then topped that with the Skillet Marsala Chicken mixture.  These changes gave me the additional sauce I wanted without sacrificing any of the yummy flavor of this dish."
1450029,52104,2012-03-02,2,"I love MizzNezz's recipes -- she's a great cook.  And I love sweet and rich.  But this cake is just too much (never thought I'd hear those words coming out of my mouth!!)  But think about it -- 3 cups of sugar, plus a pound of confectioners...a cup of butter...corn syrup...oil AND pineapple?  I actually felt a bit sick after eating a 2 x 2 inch piece.  I might try this without the buttermilk glaze and see how that goes."
1998389,15194,2011-09-03,5,"I just registered on the website just so I could leave this recipe a five-star review.  I've made a lot of pizza over the years and finally found a favorite standby, but this recipe just deposed it.  Delicious, like eating GOOD restaurant pizza, nice a crusty and, yes, chewy.  I substituted 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat, added pinches of basil, oregano, and rosemary, and a couple shakes each of garlic powder and parmesan cheese.  I was skeptical of the 500-degree oven temp because my previous recipe was low compared to that, but it came out perfect.  Thanks for sharing!"
393344,131018,2009-09-22,5,"I made my own pork rub, refrigerated overnight, then put in crock pot for 12 hours!  Yumm!! BTW, DH doesn't care for pork and he gobbled this down and asked for more!"
2044418,48162,2011-10-26,4,"Made this tonight to accompany a curry dish. Delicious!  I left out the thyme and used FRESH grated turmeric.  If you can get your hands on the fresh stuff, do it.  The flavor is so much better.  Just make sure don't turn your whole kitchen (or yourself) yellow in the process :)"
538545,58345,2008-04-20,3,"I would have liked the bottom of the crust to be crisper and for the crust itself to have been less eggy.  But as long as you put alot of stuff on it, overall, it really wasn't that bad.  For Passover, it is a good substitute though in place of the real thing.  I would make it again and will probably experiment with it."
839492,94520,2012-07-16,5,"Excellent, quick to make salad & very flavorful. I might consider using white balsamic vinegar the next time because I think it would give a more appetizing appearance. Really enjoyed the flavors and using all the fresh ingredients that won't spoil at a picnic or cookout in the summer heat. Thanks for sharing!"
37868,152087,2006-09-14,4,My Brother and I thought this recipe was good. I did not add the green pepper even though I LOVE green peppers. I used canned corn beef. I also added Pepper. It turned out very nice served with Bussel Sprouts. Very nice dinner..Thank You for the recipe that will be used again. Hugs
369363,110806,2006-11-21,5,"I like this because it's delish but also versatile. You can substitute asparagus, broccoli, broccoli rabe, swiss chard or any veg you like and it works! Thanks Paula"
199848,70022,2007-05-21,4,"Wonderful meatless dish!  This doesn't remind me of pierogies, since there is no potatoes or cheese, but it's great anyway. I had to guess at the sizes of packages, since none are given.  I used a 16-oz box of (rotini) noodles and a 16 oz jar of sauerkraut.  That seemed to work out well.  I added salt, pepper and some caraway seeds.  This is a keeper.  Thanx for sharing."
742029,87782,2009-03-04,5,"These are fantastic! I've always done a similar recipe, but without the water. The water makes a HUGE difference. We LOVE these@ Thank you so much for posting!!! They are so easy, and so delicious!!!!"
601528,325674,2008-10-25,3,The ease of preperation makes this a fun little cake to make but I just didn't like the end result very much.  I found the cake to be too dense and not really very cake like and the taste to be slightly rubbery as many foods can be when heated/cooked in the microwave.  It is a good fast  chocolate fix though!
1800054678,192661,2013-10-26,4,"This is a nice dessert recipe to keep on hand for making over and over again. I did tweak it a little bit by adding only 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 3/4 granulated sugar. After 2 and a half hours slow cooking, the rice absorbed all the liquid and turned sticky. I let it sit until cool down and served with vanilla ice cream. The texture and flavor was great! Will try to add more milk to cut back the thickness next time."
1118211,50022,2011-03-17,0,"This recipe was amazing - I substituted white chocolate chips for the regular chips and added some fresh cranberries.  It baked up moist and delicious.  I suggest (as prompted by other reviews) to bake in smaller loaves.  This does freeze well, although you probably won't have any left to freeze - it is that good."
1802829436,69051,2014-06-16,5,This recipe works great!  I substitute two cups whole wheat flour when I make it and it turns out great!
371096,62505,2006-12-10,4,"Fantastic! It even impressed our Portuguese friends. Bacon was an easy substitute for salt pork. I don't even like green beans, and I'd happily make this again and again, and again....."
283390,205569,2009-01-24,5,"We really loved this recipe! I made a few minor changes...I used a little less olive oil, added some chopped mushrooms along with the garlic, and used parsley instead of cilantro. I thought this was really flavorful and satisfying. Thanks so much for posting this...you helped me use up my French lentils!"
578636,90361,2009-09-01,5,"I love this recipe because not only is it quick/easy to make, its got so much flavor.  Its absolutely delicious.  I think the cream sauce is a must for this.  I did add just a little worsceshire to my meat.  This will definitely be a repeat meal for my house!!!"
283390,22908,2006-11-27,5,"This was super! I somehow managed to forget to buy mozzarella and I didn't realize it until too late; however, this was really good without it (I know you're saying ""Pizza without mozzarella? That's crazy!"" but it really was good). It was so nice to be able to put together such a speedy pizza crust - this was my first time using Bisquick, but I'll be using it again...for this recipe, at least. Thanks for sharing; it's a keeper!"
2001194700,374959,2016-10-04,5,"Made this dish 10/4/16 for my family of 4. Could have reduced, since the kids are little, but I love leftovers. I had to guess on the amount of time to fry the potatoes and cover and heat the sausage, so I suggest giving a suggested time. Otherwise, great recipe!"
591608,4627,2009-01-07,5,"Just made this soup - AMAZING exactly what I wanted.  It is every bit as great as the other reviewers say ... wish I had made a double batch.  The only changes I made was using tortilla chips instead of tortillas and adding a diced red pepper and a can of corn. Thank you so much for the recipe, I will be making this often."
83093,204551,2007-01-12,5,"Now that's good stuff!  I did tweak to accomodate my weight loss mission - used fake-cream (frozen, lowfat vanilla yogurt)  & my recipe #204135 in place of the chocolate syrup. Also added a little Splenda to up the sweetness & topped with a dollop of fat free Redi-Whip.  I did use an immersion blender & it worked great.  I drank some of it as an after dinner treat & stuck the rest in the freezer.  I figure I'll thaw it then beat it up again.  Will let you know if it works that way ;-)  Thanks, MP!"
2001700575,383868,2017-09-04,2,"I was looking for something similar to Dunkin Donuts plain cake donuts. While these were good, they did not have the consistency or flavor I was looking for. I do tend to augment recipes, but I made this one as directed. I don't want to slam this recipe, it just wasn't up to my expectations. I will say this is a easy recipe to make and work with."
1800243971,223073,2013-11-21,4,"I left out the cilantro and added cumin, but otherwise it was easy and tasty.  Steaming the tortillas in the microwave or oven with a cup of water is essential. Even my super picky eater ate one and said it was good."
2000586971,21201,2015-11-23,5,"Made this today.  It was very good... everyone loved it.  The first thing I did was in the morning, I coated the pecans in melted butter and let them sit.  They absorbed the butter and tasted great in the pie."
185146,132052,2005-12-11,4,"These tasted just like the ones we get when we go out for breakfast, the only alteration I made was to brown them in a little butter when they came out of the bag, it did make a difference, I forgot to put in the cheese but will put it in next time, I didn't fancy puting in the hash browns as I like them on the side with that crispy texture.  This recipe is a keeper, this will be great when the kids come over and I can have them prepared ahead of time.  Thanks for the recipe VA"
280271,456475,2012-06-04,5,"Those of us who tried this loved it...DH wouldn't taste it cuz he doesn't think fruit and salad greens go together...but the rest of us including my ""almost"" 3 year old grandson cared for it...he said ""I really care for the leafs, can I have more please?"" Thanks for posting it...:)"
2274260,380988,2012-05-25,5,"I am new to using a bread machine. I have tried several recipes that claim to be ""Soft"" and have been disappointed every time until I found this one. So easy, makes a beautiful loaf and is super soft and very tasty. I will be making this daily, my 18 year old son loves it."
461834,269771,2008-08-09,5,"Made this for DD and myself this morning, cutting the recipe in half.  I omitted the honey, I don't like real sweet, and it turned out wonderfully delicious!!!  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks Lavender Lynn.  Made for beverage tag."
424680,306878,2008-06-08,5,"I'm sure I would be said to have ruined this salsa when I reduced the amount of red chilies to just half a chili, but when I think 'salsa' I think really 'mild' & that's how I did this one! AND, I thought it was a great salsa, so there! Thanks for sharing your recipe! [Made & reviewed while on tour in Central America with the Zaar World Tour 4]"
167242,129345,2007-05-24,4,"This was VERY nice!  I made it especially for my husband, who is a lemon fiend, and he loved it.  I skimped on the oil, so it wasn't as crispy as it might have been, but it was still delicious.  Wonderful sauce.  Just a note-- I doubled the sauce, too."
482376,187184,2011-04-10,5,"I LOVE this method! Who would have thought you could put popcorn kernels into a paper bag and come out with perfect popcorn?! I have always loved microwave popcorn for the convenience, BUT hated the artificial ingredients and the amt. of salt in them. So, I usually air pop the popcorn or pop in a pot. This version gives me the quickness and convenience of microwave popcorn without the unwanted ingredients! I tried it with the parmesan garlic topping. The only thing I would change is to dump the popcorn in a bowl first, then add a little butter (instead of oil) and the rest of the toppings. I found that trying to mix it in the bag, the oil and toppings seemed to coat only the top layer. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!"
498271,214384,2012-03-19,5,"This is a very nice mocha treat!  I used lowfat milk and fat-free ice cream and enjoyed a drink that was not overly sweet and rich but tasted great.  The chocolate and coffee flavors are just right together, with neither one overpowering the other.  Perfect morning pick-me-up - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for Spring Pick-A-Chef 2012"
161953,9823,2005-09-15,4,"I'm surprised at the low rating this dish got.  I like it.  Next time I make it i'll make more sauce, though."
400708,45672,2011-02-28,5,"Let me add my 5 stars to this great recipe.  I love Pampered Chef's blend and followed this recipe and it taste just like it and sooo much cheaper.  It made TWO shakers full, enough for me and my DD.  I did throw it all in my magic bullet and blended for a few seconds to make sure all was mixed well and that worked great.  Thanks so much for posting - this is what I'll be using from now on!"
535633,292812,2009-01-18,5,These cookies are great!  I had a great time making these as I had help from a 2 year old.  I had a family gathering the other day and everyone enjoyed these.  Thanks for the great recipe.
64934,52358,2003-08-20,5,"This was delicious!  Since it was a hot, humid day I decided to use the crockpot and came across this recipe.  I followed it exactly except I found I didn't need to add the corn starch to thicken it at the end.  The sauce was delicious served over plain white rice.  This is definitely a keeper and I'll be making it again.  Thanks for sharing!"
30209,93886,2008-09-28,4,"This was my first time making apple butter.  As written, it is too sweet for me.  (And I like sweet stuff!)  Next time, I will cut the sugar to 3 cups.  The spices were PERFECT!  I had to cook mine for about 12 hours.  Then I put it in the blender to make it smooth.  Will make again with less sugar."
572152,84161,2008-03-31,4,Very good recipie.  I used tilapia.  I will make it again.
439731,122323,2008-01-04,3,"I tried 'veganizing' this recipe by using Earth Balance and EnergG Egg Replacers instead of eggs and butter.  While the end result was tasty, it was also very crumbly.  I had to serve it in the pan, because it just came apart when I tried to remove it.  I put a layer of custard between the flan and the fruit, which helped hold everything together.  Thankyou for providing the recipe!"
134289,119387,2008-07-18,5,Very good pizza dough.  I used this recipe with Kittencal's Cabbage-Beef Stuffed Bread Buns (Runza).  The dough was very easy to work with and tasted great.  Next time I am going to cut down on the salt a bit (personal preference).  I can't wait to make pizza with this dough recipe.
1981065,54257,2017-05-18,5,It was an excellent meatloaf. Very surprised it was as good with so few ingredients. Will be my go-to recipe from now on.....
242006,28148,2005-10-15,5,"I made these the other night and everyone really loved them!  I roasted chicken quarters in the oven with latin spices on it, and then shredded the meat for my chimichangas.  I got 8 out of all of the mixture.  I didn't used melted margarine for the tops, what I did was I sprayed the baking pan with Pam and then put the chimichangas on and sprayed them with ""I can't believe it's not butter"" spray. They turned out great, crunchy and delish!  Next time I will add a little salt to the mixture, but other than that they were great!  Thank You for a great Idea!"
1166952,135350,2010-04-04,5,this is thee best home-baked macaroni and cheese i have ever had.. and the only one that i was able to make lol...its great!!
2001495929,66148,2017-08-24,5,"I have made these tarts twice, once using the pastry crust in the recipe and this morning using filo. I like the pastry crust but I have to say, the crunch of the filo is fantastic! What a wonderful recipe this is. It couldn't be easier or more delicious! Thanks!"
2000295511,54351,2015-06-25,5,"Everyone who gave it 5 stars were telling the truth. If they had an oatmeal contest on master chef and you made these, chef Ramsey would say they were the best oatmeal cookies he&#039;s ever had in his life. WOW they were delicious. I can&#039;t believe I made these. LOL. I&#039;m keeping this recipe."
2001004779,80435,2016-05-08,5,"Once I discovered Barilla no-boil noodles, I won't make my lasagna the traditional way anymore. This is a terrific basic recipe, but you're gonna wanna tweak it to your personal tastes. I use 1b. sweet italian sausage, to which I add sliced mushrooms, sliced black olives and 14 oz. can Italian seasoned diced tomatoes. I then only use 24 oz. of marinara sauce, for a chunkier texture. I use 2 cups Italian blend cheese, but only 1 1/2 cups mixed with the Ricotta, saving 1/2 cup for the top with a sprinkling of Parmesan. Oh, and there's a layer of sliced Provolone in the middle. When I'm feeling vegetarian, I substitute zucchini, mushroom, onion, bell peppers, and/or spinach. Love the flexibility of this recipe!"
67728,119586,2005-12-08,5,"Yay, I finally found a recipe for these that works for me! I tried making conchas for DH a while back, but the recipe I used was way too vague for a not-so-good bread baker (it neglected to mention that only people baking conchas in a tropical rainforest would need to use the full amount of flour specified in the recipe). Those conchas, needless to say, came out suitable for use as doorstops. These, on the other hand, warranted an ""almost like mama's"" from my Mexican DH (a comment not often given when I try to recreate foods he misses from his childhood). I'll definitely be making these for him again. Thanks for posting!  "
954129,96843,2009-04-29,5,Excellent!
1802667521,197922,2014-04-14,4,"Very good. I don&#039;t like quite so much lemon juice, so I used one lemon and the zest of that lemon."
839492,21768,2013-12-11,5,"This one is a keeper, left out the pimento (didn&#039;t have it), subbed chipotle hot sauce for red pepper &amp; added 1/4 c. Chopped cilantro just before serving. Might add a squeeze of lime next time. Topped with shredded sharp cheddar.....kids kept saying how good it was &amp; went for seconds. Thanks for sharing!"
146047,57059,2004-08-23,5,"This was really tasty. I used a 2-pound eye round roast which was nice and tender after spending 8 hours on high in the crockpot.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so I used evaporated skim milk and 6 oz fresh mushrooms.  I also used white rather than red wine since that's what we had on hand.  When the meat was tender, I removed it from the pot, and pureed the remaining mushroom/onion/wine/broth mixture.  Just before serving over steamed rice, I added fresh basil, fresh parsley, a tsp of sugar, and some white balsamic vinegar, to give it a little extra oomph.  DH and I both enjoyed this...thanks for posting."
63098,53285,2010-05-09,4,I love this recipe too! I have the same one except mine calls for colby/ monterey jack cheese. But now days with all the varieties available I like to use a hot pepper cheese sometimes. Making it even hotter with hot mexican chili powder is a great way to turn up the heat.
93230,1746,2003-10-07,5,"I made this last night and my boyfriend loved it. I had never made applesauce before and this quick and simple recipe caught my eye. I used brown sugar instead of white though. It turned out rather brown, but delicious. "
713725,109264,2008-01-22,5,Very tasty. I used only 1# of ground meat and a smaller pan. Then I cut them into larger portions to fit onto regular sized hamburger buns.
2002248161,431399,2018-08-15,5,Wowie! They are so simple and easy! I make them so often I know how to make them by heart!
12200,10125,2001-07-11,0,One of the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made.
171303,151177,2006-10-25,5,"Very delish.  I did omit the oil from the marinade and only used a tsp to stir fry the chicken.  Added some snow peas right to the skillet after stir frying the chicken, served over steamed jasmine rice and it was a great meal. Thank you CoffeeMom for sharing the recipe."
288838,153694,2006-01-31,5,Great dish! Talk about yummy comfort food.
74558,59219,2006-04-25,5,"So similar, Audrey, to my dear mother's recipe I remember she served when I was a child.  The recipe is perfect as it is.... but, I did add fresh, chopped dill, to punctuate the ethnicity.... Delicious.

I scrubbed the potatoes well, left the skins on and sliced them paper thin; sliced the onion paper thin, as well,  then layered them alternately with the potatoes and dill.  The sour cream mixture is the crowning glory, Audrey, and creates a wonderful custard in which to cook the potatoes. I do appreciate your willingness to share this recipe with everyone in the world.  :-)"
153438,4897,2004-11-12,5,"I loved this recipe.  I added some ground beef as well, and it was amazing. and it is super easy.  TRY IT!!"

32411,172397,2009-10-07,5,"I was a chutney virgin before making this.  My English in-laws swore it was the best way to use up the end-of-summer tomatoes.  So, I found this recipe and boy am I glad!  I have already made a second batch.  Everyone who has tasted it has raved about it.  Thank you so much for sharing this!  (P.S. I did it with the balsamic vinegar.)"
308434,8251,2007-02-13,5,This is wonderful!  The only change I made was that I used chicken stock instead of the sherry.  The meat was tender and juicy.  Will make this again.  Thanks for sharing.
708506,272698,2013-10-06,5,So good! Wanted to do something simple (and quick) with some sea scallops from the freezer. My husband was quite impressed.
252514,419782,2011-10-25,5,"Thank you so much for sharing your family's recipe with us. The Italian side of my family too hails from Calabria and I was so happy to try your dish. This is true comfort food, and absolutely delicious! I wasn't sure and so left the sausages partially whole instead of slicing them in this dish. Also I used tsp's on the spices as I only had dried herbs and assumed the recipe was to be made with fresh herbs. Served over angel hair pasta. This was so good, I know I will make it often! Thank you, Cooks4_6 [Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag]"
502147,169620,2008-01-04,5,"I made this over the Christmas holidays and loved it!  I had planned to share some with friends, but couldn't talk myself into parting with any!  Maybe next time, and there will definitely be a next time!  Thanks for a great sweet and a little spicy recipe!"
2894200,71109,2013-07-14,5,Yummy! I was looking for a way to use the extra blueberries in the fridge before they went bad. This was amazing! Quick and easy to make too!
1967465,163343,2011-07-26,1,very bland
279912,243419,2009-01-18,4,Great flavors. I love the cream cheese in place of the typical tomato sauce - wish I hadn't deseeded the jalapenos because it lacked the spice I was hoping for ... Boyfriend gobbled it up! Thanks for a keeper!
2000437018,82830,2015-08-29,5,"I found this recipe because I had a big box of Bisquick and wanted to use it up. It&#039;s not very cornbread like, (only 3 Tbsp of corn meal) but it&#039;s VERY POPULAR! Everyone loves it! It&#039;s like sweet corn cake. I usually cut the milk to 1/3 cup and add a can of corn and a jalape&ntilde;o or two: blended. 

Preparation notes: Preheat oven to 350&ordm;F. Melt butter in saucepan on low.   In the meantime, in a large work bowl: 3 eggs and 1/3 cup milk, beat eggs and milk. Add remaining wet ingredients except butter. In a separate bowl, combine all dry ingredients. As soon as butter is melted, remove from heat. Grease pyrex pan with a couple pats of butter, room temp. Whisk melted butter from saucepan with wet ingredients. Add dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir until combined. Pour into pan and straight into preheated oven for 35 minutes."
9869,28530,2005-06-27,5,"Great tasting mushroom sauce, I made this to serve with mock filet mignon and it was a great accompaniment.
Thanks Jen."
382203,112578,2012-10-13,5,"OMG i loved the flavor in this recipe.  I did change it around a bit.  I was having a crowd up to the lake so I made it into a casserole instead of french toast.  I spread the cheese mixture on the bread and then cut them up into cubes and put them into a casserole, added the egg mixer,dolloped some lemon curd on top and put it in the fridge until morning.  I baked it at 350 for about 45 min.  it was wonderful. thanks"
481092,225761,2007-12-02,5,Excellent breakfast casserole.  I made up the night before so I just popped in the oven for breakfast. Served with poached eggs and fruit.  I used Jimmy Dean hot sausage and coursely chopped swiss. Received rave reviews.
2523340,44299,2012-11-23,5,"Oops - in addition to my raving review I forgot to mention that I did make two minor tweaks to the recipe.  I used a little more chicken broth (2 cups versus the called for 1 1/2 cups).  The extra broth in my opinion was perfect, we like moist (but not soggy) stuffing.  I also used a couple tablespoons of natural butter flavored EVOO to saute the veggies instead of the 1/2 cup of butter it called for.  Other than that, I followed recipe exactly and oh my goodness was it delicious!!"
244146,130084,2006-08-12,5,"VERY VERY VERY GOOD! I used one huge zucchini from my garden instead of 4 regular sized and scooped the pulp from that, real good flavor. Had two nights worth of dinner for my husband, son and I. (btw, my 2 year old son loved this meal!!) Thanks for sharing"
1814491,41703,2013-01-19,5,"This recipe was FABULOUS!  Did add 2 cloves minced garlic and one stalk of celery, thinly sliced.  Added 1/2 cup chicken broth last hour as I thought just a little thick.  Served with buttered noodles and glazed baby carrots.  May try other options next time:  Add 1/2 red wine at the start, or, add 1/2 cup sour cream stirred in before serving, or, add cubed potatoes and carrots last hour of cooking (another viewer suggested this), or, use Lipton onion gravy mix or country gravy mix.  So very simple and delicious!!!!   My and my guests loved it and asked for your recipe."
136997,129438,2007-03-19,5,"Wow Karen, these are loaded!! I have to agree with the other posters and say only a small piece at a time, except if I know my husband, he won't want just a small one. lol! I added an extra cup of crispies 'cause I love crispies. :)"

145489,250284,2007-09-17,5,This was lovely!  I also added a bit of seltzer to add some fizzle. Thanks!
2000915451,145580,2016-03-12,5,"This recipe saved me. All my local stores stopped carrying the English Toffee Cappuccino mix that I had become addicted too. I came across this recipe and it&#039;s even better than the one I used to buy. It tastes wonderful and it stays mixed once I stir it into hot water. Plus, I know what is in it!"
27783,53909,2004-04-23,5,"Delicious!  I finally got around to making this very easy, yet very tasty recipe.  I also used Chef Paul's Blackened Seasoning for this.  The fish came out so tender and very attractive.  My husband added a sprinkling of cayenne to his porton to give it more kick."
55143,17727,2002-10-02,5,My friend made this for dessert tonight. It was delicious!! She used French Vanilla ice cream instead of the recommended flavor. It was great!!
56087,32204,2007-05-23,5,"I've resisted trying this one for so long, but how can so many people be wrong???  THEY CAN'T.. 
This is my new go to Brownie recipe.  Loved the ease of throwing them together.  This is the recipe I've been looking for.
I made a double batch, hoping for the best.  I ""sprinkled"" PB chips on half and macadamia nuts on the other half to appease both Hubby and the Grandson.  ENTIRE batch was gone in 2 days.
Thanks for sharing this recipe."
527886,309586,2009-12-06,4,"An easy ginger bread for very ripe plantains. The bread soaks around the plantain layer, so it's not very distinct. There is a strong ""dark"" taste, from the molasses and ginger. This might be nice drizzled with a light rum icing."
47892,311749,2008-11-04,5,"We love this, but Mr. Cookgirl loved this especially.  I cheated and used Tabasco Chipotle Sauce instead of opening up a can of chipotles in adobo. This was a nice change of pace from the usual Mexican rice. White cheddar cheese is near and dear to my clogged arteries! Thanks, Impera. cg ;)"
47559,49929,2003-01-15,5,"This combination of spices was just right!  A delicious mushroom recipe.  With the herbs providing so much flavor, I believe the butter and olive oil could be reduced for a lower fat version of the recipe - another bonus."
352885,292396,2009-01-13,5,"Shazzie, I made this for a dinner party we had before Christmas.  In a word:  winner!  I served it with the sherried cream sauce and my guests loved the taste.  I loved that I could freeze ahead and have an elegant and tasty dinner for 10 without the last minute stress.  My only change:  a little less tarragon because I am not a huge fan and I chopped the ham instead of leaving in strips.  I love the cream cheese pastry.  Thanks for posting!"

47892,373374,2012-02-02,0,"Very unusual way to prepare beets. *Fresh* golden beets subbed for red and I made<br/>a small batch. The beets were partially roasted, cooled, sliced then followed the recipe as indicated. I don't know if I would like the recipe as well using canned beets although CG does have a secret love for canned beets. Thanks for posting. I probably would never have tried this recipe if it hadn't been for the Best of 2011 tag game."
177135,38552,2006-06-09,5,I made this last night and I quite enjoyed it....but hubby didn't care for it....but since I'm writing the review I'll give it the 5 stars it deserves !
104103,26911,2003-12-02,5,"Total comfort food and great way to use up some of those holiday left overs. Simple, subtle, and delicious. Even my picky SO loved this one. I'll be making this again!"
489818,221779,2007-05-16,3,very cute but more work then I would go to unless I had a very creative husband (and I don't) or some kids that I wanted to keep busy.
904480,162319,2008-08-07,5,"I've made this bread four times now. It's excellent. The flavor is really delicious. My husband says, ""This is the best bread ever!"" It's now our everyday bread. We love it!"
580295,607,2007-10-23,5,My parents are from the St. Louis area and this is the French Onion Soup that my mom makes. We always had this as part of our Christmas Dinner. This is a great recipe!
761589,281472,2008-04-20,5,"I made this yesterday and it was so good! My husband even liked it, and he is a very picky eater. I didn't add bay leaves or peppercorns because I didn't have any, and I also only added one teaspoon of salt. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it made a very nice sauce. Thank you for this recipe!"
564101,312076,2008-07-25,5,"This was great!  I left out the kiwi, used a few more strawberries and used a whole apple.  My boyfriend and mom loved it and I just adore my grandma's apple butter so this was a total A+ in my book.  This will undoubtly be made again.  Thanks for sharing!!"
761979,28240,2009-05-15,4,"This had nice flavor but no indication of how much to use.  I ended up using 3 teaspoons with a half pound of hamburger.  To bring out the flavors a bit more, I added about 1/4 teaspoon salt, but that was mainly because I wasn't sure how much seasoning to use.  I also ended up adding 1 teaspoon corn starch to 1/3 cup water to have a bit of sauce to simmer in.   The moisture did simmer completely off."
1802711505,74275,2015-09-17,5,I checked out this recipe and I think it has to be one of the easiest ones I&#039;ve seen on the internet.  The similarity to my Mom&#039;s is unbelievable!  The only difference is she uses evaporated milk instead of half and half.  I always keep evaporated milk in my cupboard just for potato soup and my grandkids ask me to make it instead for lunch of any other soup.  If you have nothing to thicken it with and happen to save leftover mashed potatoes (I do) use those.  They also increase the flavor of the potatoes in the soup.  This soup is a winner!
47907,111783,2005-10-09,5,I made this for a delicious snack today and we loved it!  I love crab anything and this is one we will be making alot.  We served with crackers.  Thanks for the great recipe!
906665,284640,2012-01-22,5,"I wasn't so sure about these cookies last night when I made them, as I felt something was missing. However, this morning, I couldn't stop eating them! Very chewy and addictive. The extra day really made a big difference to the taste."
227607,98035,2007-10-04,5,This was one of those rare recipes that everyone(picky husband and 5 kids) loved and said to make again.  I doubled the recipe and added some garlic while it was cooking.  I cooked the potatoes just a touch too long and will shorten the cooking time next time.  I also added a good tablespoon of butter after draining the juice off.  I made biscuits to go with it.
710496,200673,2008-01-09,5,"This was fantastic and easy to make.  The roasted red peppers gave the stromboli a nice flavor.  Next time, I think I might put some mushrooms inside, or perhaps some sauteed onions.  The possibilities are endless!"
424680,370046,2010-03-19,5,"I cut this recipe in half but did use 2 medium size oranges & pretty much followed the recipe! We really enjoyed the combo of flavors here, what with the orange, almond AND cranberries (definitely these, & I actually used a 1/4 cup of them)! I look forward to making this with blood oranges as others have done with supurb results! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Made & reviewed in NA*ME tag]"
373020,201918,2011-10-21,5,"I have been making this for years, I like to top mine with cheese.  Delicious and fabulous. I"
220348,210059,2008-05-20,4,"I liked this very much, especially since I was using mild curry. But I did think the orange flavour was a little to overpowering. I guess I was expecting the orange flavour, but I Thought it would also blend in more with the other flavours too."
1072593,339780,2011-07-13,5,Made especially for sandwiches but forgot my husband's point of a sandwich is covering every inch of bread with meat so that you forget you're eating bread.
215765,41893,2005-11-17,5,"Very, very good!!  Excellent toasted with honey!!"
150281,139227,2007-06-06,5,"I love riace dished and this was really nice, I loved all the ingredients, the colors were outstanding, I dont know if I like the Avocado or the black olives better. I followed the directions comepletely, except I added some wild rice, because I could. Will make again! Thank you.
ZWT3"
302283,64680,2006-03-16,5,oh you are the best!  thanks for the head's up on this!!
156460,96098,2004-08-09,5,"I photographed the complete product, I hope it will be posted here.  It was EXCELLENT, the crusty edges while baking are very good.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs although quite salty, next time I will use less salt.  Thank you for this great recipe."
2117138,57177,2011-12-22,5,"I have been making this appetizer for over 30 years; it has always been enjoyed by everyone. I use rye and pumpernickel cocktail breads, and slice the cucumber paper thin. I have always used an entire packet of the dry dressing mix and a brick of cream cheese--easy and delicious! This is especially good for a summer party."
766964,116536,2009-05-19,5,OMG these are soooo good! I don't think I will ever want to eat shrimp another way! They are sooo easy to make too!  The Lime Cayenne Mayonnaise is a must with these.  I put about 2 tbl of the chiles and just a little more honey just so that there was more for them to marinate in.
107135,425747,2010-05-25,5,"ok i used beef and celery stalks cause no celery root 
 
 is a really good variation on pot roast 
 1 also froze part of this  varies the  rotation  i cooked meat awhile before i added veggies i swear the meat is tough now days lol zaar tour 6"
37868,11615,2002-05-13,5,"Here we go southren cooking you got it.
Hope you all see all of my postings.
This is some good eating.

Thank You"
862801,190639,2009-12-29,3,"I followed the recipe and I don't know where I went wrong, but the cherry section never hardened it was just very gooey.  The taste was good, but I would have to try again before making for a party."
103876,65131,2012-07-22,5,Tasty and easy way to use this healthy grain.  I served it cold and it was even better the next day on a salad with some balsamic dressing.
27643,14433,2003-08-19,5,"Boy, this is the best way to have corn. This tastes SO fresh. I ended up making a bigger batch of it the next day and freezing it for this winter. Can't wait to have this when everyone else is eating that old canned stuff! The only work to it is cutting the corn off the ears, after that it's a cinch. Thanks Gay! Good!!"
327600,18597,2010-01-21,5,"AWESOME!  LOVED the texture of this rice dish ~ and the flavour, too, of course!"
231198,59289,2007-11-26,5,"Yum!  I had made some meatballs for OAMC, and was tired of eating them with spaghetti.  Both DS loved this!  I used lowfat cream cheese, and it still tasted great.  Thanks for posting, Jamie Renee!"
444132,381195,2009-10-04,5,"These muffins are absolutely delicious! I added double the spices, as suggested by previous reviewers, and am I ever glad I did! I also mixed up 1 1/2 tbsp sugar and 1/4 tsp cinnamon and sprinkled the tops with this to make a lovely crunchy and sweet top.  These were super yummy! This recipe halves nicely, and made a perfect dozen. Thanks for sharing this recipe - I'll make it regularly! Made for PAC Fall 2009 - you were adopted!"
344494,37413,2007-04-24,5,this meal is awesome!!  my kids loved it almost as much as my husband.  my husband couldn't believe we weren't putting these burgers on buns and after his first bite he knew why!! very very good meat and potatoes meal.
69838,56653,2004-05-29,5,"YUM! This rice is fabulous! I served this with Geema's Pan Fried Fish Bombay.  I thoroughly enjoyed this rice and the huge amount of leftovers that are still in my fridge (Im eating the leftovers for like..every meal LOL).  Thanks for this recipe! :) I WILL be making this again, for sure ;)"
2002101455,434863,2018-04-07,0,"Can I substitute stevia for the Splenda? And if so, any idea the ratio?"
666723,7537,2009-07-15,4,I used this crust but used smashed up Ginger Snaps.  It was really really tasty but the only thing that bothered me was that the crust stuck really bad to the pie plate.  I guess I should have sprayed it with cooking spray first.  Will try again.  Nice and easy though.
1948596,25534,2011-07-04,5,I love this recipe...I am on a low carb diet so I dont add the flour...still fantastic!
188744,59662,2005-06-09,5,"My first try at Potato Salad is a huge success! What a great recipe. Delicious and versatile. Skipped the pimento, celery salt & seeds, used spicy mustard and more oinion powder ant it was *exactly* the taste I was after. Couldn't wait to have again with lunch today. Thanks for the recipe!!!"
61569,35629,2010-02-20,4,"I really thought I would like this but had problems with the lentil puree.  Perhaps  I did not cook this long enough but after adding water little by little, my blender struggled to puree this.  The taste was little bland which surprised me and had to add more lemon juice.  It's somewhat similar to hummus but we thought hummus made with garbanzo beans taste better and smoother.  I liked the concept of grilling fish and putting it on puree like this though.  The taste was more like 3 1/2 and concept 4 1/2.  Thank you for posting this recipe."
422893,306373,2008-06-24,5,I took the idea of this & ran with it to make a non alcoholic coffe treat. I used irish cream & chocolate flavoured coffee syrups and added some coconut milk powder for the hint of coconut. All combined to make a delicous coffee this afternoon. Made for ZWT 4.
482376,139227,2008-12-30,5,"This recipe made it into book#234156! 
OUTSTANDING! What an excellent rice dish. I made it as a side, but could quite contentedly eat this as my main course. It is almost silky in texture..perfection. Plus, the combination of avocadoes, tomato and black olives is to die for. Fantastic recipe. Thank you!!"
366781,171421,2008-11-24,4,My DH is diabetic so I am always looking for something different as a side dish especially.  This was very good.  I didn't have vanilla yogurt so I used plain and added a hit of vanilla to the yogurt.  It was enjoyed by all.
2839749,227127,2013-05-25,0,Stay away - entirely to salty - I&#039;m puckered up
1292935,53508,2010-04-24,5,"My family loved this recipe!  My husband, who doesn't usually like things he considers to be ""fru-fru"" really enjoyed this.  My 2 yr old is not always crazy about chicken but I think the addition of grapes made it appealing to her.  Oh, and I was short on worcestershire sauce but it was still delicious.  Thanks!"
212585,205873,2007-11-26,5,This is easy and delicious.  My whole family loved it.
1666812,15865,2010-08-22,5,"These were DELICIOUS! I personally don't like the sauce because I hate vinegar but my husband loved it. They were really easy to make. I didn't use red chili paste or spicy mustard because I didn't want spice in it since my kids were eating them. The recipe doesn't make much, I doubled everything and next time I will have to triple them as there were no leftovers and we were short one person. But definitely something that will be a regular dinner in our house!! YUM"
157102,37638,2009-11-11,0,"Yum. I used jasmine rice, so reduced the water to 1 1/2 cups and only had to simmer 25 minutes. Upon other reviewers' suggestions, I upped the chili powder, and added 1/2 teaspoon cumin and 1 teaspoon oregano. Also, I used corn rather than diced green pepper-- that's what I had on hand, and it worked just fine. This was really delicious and I am so happy to have found a good Spanish rice recipe! Will definitely make again."
911978,148058,2011-11-19,5,"A keeper! Great flavor, beautiful colors. I used turkey instead of chicken and fried the pepper as other reviewers suggested. Served with jasmine rice. Thanks for posting."
500476,134924,2010-08-20,5,This is a great way to eat brown rice.  I loved that it tasted so different from many rice dishes.  I made it on the stovetop as I didn't want to heat up my kitchen with the oven.  I doubled the rice and water but not the seasonings.  That seemed just right for us.  I also stirred in some chopped chicken and cooked peas at the end for a one pot meal.  Great recipe!  This will definitely go into my regular rotation.
317809,97389,2008-08-19,5,Great fun to make and tasty too.  We used all fresh berries and the combo made it a decadent dark burgundy color. Its a hit with us.
339260,121987,2007-09-23,5,"It doesn't get any easier than this.  Very good roast recipe.  I couldn't find a bolar roast at the market, so the man in the meat department showed me a roast that would be comparable.  I made this in a cooking bag in my crock pot.  The roast turned out very tender and the gravy that I made from the drippings was very good.  I can't wait to have roast beef sandwiches tomorrow for lunch.  Thanks for sharing such an easy and tasty recipe, Stardustannie."
173314,120519,2008-09-18,5,Turned out great.... used regular size...not jumbo. ...bagels.... turned out excellent. omitted butter. thanks pamela!
353579,178337,2006-10-15,4,Really easy and very good.  Makes lots of dip; I could probably have managed with half the amount.  Thanks for posting!
51047,12654,2004-12-14,0,"Hi,  Wish that this recipe had sizes of salted nut jars and packages of chocolate chips.  8, 12 or 16 oz. jars?  6, 12 or 24 oz. packages of chocolate chips?    "
67899,54899,2004-05-19,5,"This is so delicious! It's light and tasty and perfect for a warm Spring night. I used reduced fat Bisquick and Egg Beaters to make it a little healthier and used soy milk and soy parmesan. Other than that I followed the directions exactly and it was very easy to make. There are only 3 of us in my family and we polished off all but a sliver. I'll definitely be making this again soon. Thanks, Fluffy!"
284180,344032,2009-04-01,5,"Delicious and easy.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, and served with Granny Smith apple slices.  Yummy!"
756031,118112,2009-08-06,5,"Gayla this is a 10 star recipe!  Honestly, I served the grilled marinaded asparagus along side our ""normal"" lightly steamed asparagus topped with hollandaise sauce for our side dish one evening.  To say the least ALL the grilled asparagus was gone and the family was looking for more (the steamed asparagus plate was  barely touched).  I am ashamed that I haven't reviewed this until now as we have been enjoying this for months now.   Thank you for a family regular!!!!!!!!"
44383,45070,2004-12-29,5,Excellent. Even DH liked it a lot and he's not a big meat pie lover.  I cut down the potato to only one but it still came out perfect for us. Thanks for a great turkey leftover recipe!
207478,102015,2009-05-11,5,This worked out exactly the way it should. I think the slow cooking is really what makes it come out. The chicken was tender and moist - didn't really need a knife to cut it - and the rice was nicely done. Really good flavor and couldn't be easier to put together!! Thanks!
679953,259423,2011-01-29,5,"GREAT TASTING RECIPE!!  Other than using canned tomatoes, maade as posted.  Marinade was super !!, and this was a fantastic meal.  Thanks for posting.  Made for PRMR.."
22995,13704,2001-11-06,5,"If Elvis loved it, it has to be good.  Seriously it sounds just like what I make, it's very good."
2001975677,521550,2018-02-05,0,"TKS stopped selling this salad, so I am so grateful for this recipe!!!!"
1802849661,295726,2017-04-03,5,How have I never had okra until now?! This was phenomenal! So tasty and simple to make; loved all the flavours in there too. My fianc&eacute; loved it too; keeping this recipe to hand for future reference!
557649,453403,2011-04-11,5,"This is one of my favorite dips.  I add other ingredients to it though sometimes.  I always use fresh spinach, julienned, instead of frozen or canned.  Not as mushy then, to me.  I sometimes add bacon bits, and whipped cream cheese to make it a little more solid.  I have added chicken bouillon powder, just a little, to it too.  Finely diced celery, finely diced onions, garlic powder, finely diced peppers, I have also added.  Sometimes just to use up some things I have in the frig, so they don't go bad.  But it is really good just made up from the package directions."
424680,358997,2009-10-16,5,"I often do crock pot chicken with whole berry cranberry sauce so this recipe was a nice change of pace from that! Easy to put together, as well as making a very tasty main dish when served over a combo of brown rice & peas! [Made & reviewed for one of my adopted orphans in the current Pick A Chef]"
2000498330,255486,2018-09-01,5,Scrumptious grilled sandwich. The chopped apple salad melded into the melty cheese and then there is the ham. A wonderful comfort food experience. Very happy.
346874,256294,2008-12-08,5,"Delicious!  I made one triple-batch with pecans and walnuts and one with just pecans, and I preferred the just pecans one.  This was SO easy to make!  Definitely does NOT make clusters, just nice crunchy granola for cereal or for topping things (also a delicious snack).  Will definitely make again!  We're giving these batches away as gifts."
644191,321710,2011-02-22,5,"Very nice.  I actually didn't use the apple cider, and it still came out lovely."
1072593,466949,2013-02-19,5,And the winner.....(drumroll please).....for the recipe with the lemonyest lemon pepper.....and best balanced flavor.....the one that edged out all other competitors.....though just by a hair.....it's....it's.....recipe #466949.
465647,12373,2007-11-24,4,"i love this, i add some chocolate chips too, usually a bit of white and dark.  My kids eat them faster than i can make them."
21752,107996,2006-07-20,5,"Hey chia!  Last time I made one of your asparagus dishes I got a marriage proposal.  No proposal this time, actually it probably warrants a divorce since he hogged the whole thing for himself and hardly let me have any!  If I ever want some I'm going to have to wait until Sushiman goes off on a business trip.  Another winner, thanks!"
464080,428770,2010-06-08,5,"Nice, flavorful couscous!  Would be great with some chicken or shrimp.  Came together quite quickly and is very inexpensive!!!  Made for the ZWT6 Couscous Challenge for Team SSaSSy.  THANKS!"
2002046003,59319,2018-03-12,5,"So yummy! Replaced spinach with Swiss chard fresh from the garden and used all four herbs suggested -perfect! Mustard sauce was delicious, but would have been just as good without it. Definitely sprinkle the chives on top of the sauce -pretty and adds a nice little pop! This fed four of us. I donât think our family could have stretched it to six servings! Sides were fresh from the garden steamed sweet potatoes and baby broccoli. Will be making this again for sure!"
1072593,70117,2011-09-29,5,You smell that?  It's a blue cheese smell.  One that's been aging for 3 months.  Don't resist it; go ahead and lick your monitor.
353579,285538,2008-03-20,5,"Okay, I have a great apple pie recipe, and I still stand by it, but I believe the consensus of my family was that this one is ""amazing.""  The crust is fantastic and I really like the use of brown sugar and I love spicy fruit desserts.  We tried it with cheese and ice cream (not together).  The cheese was a new experience and quite nice.  I don't think it will displace ice cream as an accompaniment but I'm glad we tried it after hearing about it many times.  Thanks for posting!"
1060667,338900,2016-11-13,5,"5 stars for easy and quickness, taste good too! Topped with crumbled bacon :)"
573325,384750,2010-05-23,5,"Kat, this topping mix is FANTASTIC!!!! What an easy way to sneak some halthy fats into your body and so tasty, too! YUM!
I used garlic powder in place of the flakes (as I couldnt locate flakes anywhere) and instead of plain onion flakes I decided to use a blend of shallot, green onion and chili flakes, which added a really nice heat to the mix. I sprinkled this on top of loof's Recipe #267069, which was such a great addition!
The only thing I would be careful with next time is the salt. I thought it might have been just a tad too much. Next  time Ill just use a little less.
THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this outstanding recipe with us, Kat!
Made and reviewed for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders May 2010."
167277,195729,2007-11-07,4,This was such a nice change of pace! I didn't have dried chipotle powder on hand so I used ancho chili powder and a pinch of cayenne. I served this with pork chops and beets.  I will definately make this again!
618332,113817,2007-12-05,5,"This was hands down, the best fish I've ever had! I halved the recipe, since there were only two of us, and made up the dill sauce from Recipe #262920. I served the fish and sauce over rice and made a lemon-butter dipping sauce for the asparagus. Quick, easy, and scrumptious!"
870705,36041,2012-02-24,5,Love this recipe!  I've made this many times and everyone raves about it.  The only change I make is to eliminate the almond extract and use 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  I can't recommend it highly enough!
765012,438883,2012-04-27,5,Definatly a keeper! Made exactly as stated except used fat free half and half and it turned out rich and creamy and my kids gobbled it up. Great recipe:)
96177,51235,2008-08-15,5,Ah... yes!!! one of my most favorite things to eat when in Italy.
362734,43023,2007-04-26,5,I made this dish to go with a roasted chicken. I decided to double the sauce as has been suggested. The taste was fabulous! Much healthier that alfredo but it still had a great garlic and cheese flavor with plenty of creaminess. Very satisfying side dish!
1692440,130916,2012-12-19,5,I have made this rice a few times and it turns out great.I usually always fixed red rice but now my husband always ask for this rice now. Thank You for posting it.
2001289780,238994,2016-12-09,5,Absolutely superb. 25 minutes worked perfectly. The shells were nice and crisp. Making it easy to snap and pull the luscious meat right out. I will never steam again.
55966,140050,2008-05-01,5,"AWESOME! I made this with orange essence Craisins as it is the only dried fruit my oldest son likes. Wasn't sure how the flavors would play together, but it is really wonderful!"
130219,47702,2008-01-17,5,"First, I must admit the only reason I made this is because I had a can of diced rutabagas in the pantry that I didn't know what to do with! I'm so glad I found this recipe to use them in because it is absolutely wonderful. The tang from the cranberries mixed with the sweetness of the apples & rutabaga makes this just great. This would be a wonderful side to pork, chicken, ham or turkey. For me it was a great snack dessert. I did omit the butter, just to save fat and calories. Now I'll have to buy more rutabaga just so I can make this. Thank you Jenny, this is wonderful."
12657,20437,2002-05-23,4,"Very interesting! :) This was my first experience making crepes, and I must say I think they turned out pretty well. They did get a little scrunched up while flipping them over, but it wasn't as difficult as I'd expected. I used melted butter, and white sugar. I had these with pure maple syrup for a sweet snack!"
2000953256,128098,2016-04-02,5,"Have tried many mini muffin recipes and none were quite right. Made these this morning. I substituted butter for shortening as I didn&#039;t have shortening. I softened the butter (not melted), and creamed with the sugar. These muffins came out perfect!  They were slightly crisp on the top and soft and chocolaty in the middle. All that you want in a muffin, bitesize!"
383346,148484,2012-02-06,5,It's the easiest way to do mashed potatoes.  It was perfect.  Thanks foodtvfan :) Made for the best of 2011 tag game
373020,23480,2013-08-06,5,The kids loved this - I think any colour Jelly would work great.  Thanks for posting!
350812,272309,2011-01-02,4,"These were really good! I used 1C frozen peaches, 1t of cinnamon, 1/2t of nutmeg & skipped the ginger.  I subbed applesauce for the oil and used the white whole wheat flour. Oh and I added 1/3c of white chocolate chips ~grin~.  They did overflow the muffin tins a bit....I think I could have easily gotten 15 muffins out of this recipe.  I'll freeze these for the kids to grab on their way out the door in the mornings. Thanks for sharing!"
185466,222184,2007-06-22,4,This was delicious and easy. Definitely will make again.
1678694,359279,2017-08-25,0,"I need to try again.. didn't work in NutraBullet, need to use food processor instead. Also, I substituted dark cocoa powder (used only half the amount called for), and it was too dark."
450004,426510,2011-09-07,5,"I made these for my kids as a side dish last night, and they loved them!  I tasted a little bit (very naughty of me, as I am supposed to be dieting! lol) and I also thought they were very good! They were a little salty, but I think that was more user error than anything to do with your recipe.  A definate hit with the kids, and very economical! Thanks for sharing!"
211457,32503,2006-04-06,5,My husband and I made this tonight and we were pleasantly surprised! Excellent recipe! We love this just as much as we love the lemon grilled salmon recipe. I am also going to try this marinade with whole chicken breast and bake it to see how that is (so that I can make this during days when I am too busy to fire up the grill) since the marinade is very good. My husband says this is to die for. Thanks for posting.
46660,109577,2005-10-04,5,"This recipe gets 5 stars for a few reasons.  Number one being ease of preparation...this was quicker than a lot of '30 minute meals' I've been making lately.  Another reason this is a 5 star recipe is because BOTH of my sons LOVED it, and I can't tell you how rarely it happens that they both love the same thing! Thanks for a great recipe that I'll definitely be adding to my 'favorites' cookbook!"
573090,272671,2008-01-04,4,this will be a great addition to anyones quick fix meals.  everyone in the house loved it and i will definitely be making this again.
35106,133435,2007-07-03,4,"Great recipe! I added a mix of chicken and shrimp. Good idea to cook the meats in the sauce before mixing it with the noodles, so that they get to absorb the fabulous flavors! Too bad the family ate everything up before I could take a picture :)"
2831470,107868,2013-06-05,4,Tasted really good. Easy to make in a bread machine. My family like it a lot.
725849,345212,2008-12-27,5,delicious
892967,399826,2009-11-24,2,"It seems like some of the proportions are off.  Two pounds of mushrooms were way too many.  If I did this again I'd use one pound or less.  Also four cups of broth didn't even come close to making soup.  I tripled the broth and it only just covered the mixture. It really needs sixteen cups of broth or more. The butter, flour and milk mixture did nothing for the overall recipe and should be omitted.  The meatballs were good.  Unfortunately I can only give this recipe two stars because no one went back for seconds and it just wasn't that good."
206789,55294,2005-03-31,5,great recipe That ll compliment any meal try it with onion rings too
2001641903,83828,2017-07-25,5,"Delicious! Used thin cut chicken breasts, made chicken even more favorable. Added extra garlic, since our family loves it. Otherwise, stuck to the recipe and served it with penne pasta and broccoli - family loved it! This is a recipe I will use over and over. Thank you for posting it!"
186071,56459,2006-06-08,5,Rich and comforting with a delicate aroma of vanilla. I made it as is except I went very heavy handed with the vanilla syrup. I had some left over hot cocoa so I stuck it in the fridge blended it up with some ice and vanilla syrup and we were in for a treat. Thank you Charlotte for sharing.
305531,131042,2006-11-13,4,"These are simple, easy to make, and taste good. I was going to let my grandkids help me make these, but I couldn't wait. I'm glad I did them myself - they are soooo sticky to make into balls! Fun recipe. Thanks for sharing."
58104,177651,2006-10-21,5,Nice not to sweet banana bread. I`m not a fan of banana bread BUT my DD is the expert and she enjoyed it! I did make it in a 9X13 inch pan.
2002130595,170581,2018-04-26,3,"IMHO: Definately 1 Tbls chicken base (or even less - tends to mask seafood flavors), halve the parsely, only a tiny pinch of crushed chili (also masks flavor of seafood) half an onion chopped fine would be enough (a shallot would be even better). Also, used 8 oz of each type of seafood. Ciao!"
98919,162736,2008-04-24,5,Very good!!  I make fresh asparagus and green beans like this too! Thanks for sharing a great recipe.
4470,102524,2004-11-13,5,"Man this is a perfect recipe to put on my Saturday night burger - I was in Hamburger Heaven.  I carmelized the onions before adding the mushrooms and the rest of the ingredients. I was a bit heavy on the garlic MMm Thanks Hey Jude this combination will be excellent with a steak, a chop, Brunch eggs or as I used it with a hamburger. Will be seen again on my burgers!"
1250220,39509,2009-09-18,5,"These were absolutely delicious! I plan to use them for a tiramisu recipe, but by themselves they are wonderful. Spongey and springy, but soft..MMmmm. I added a bit of almond extract in place of 1/4 a tsp of vanilla just to enhance the flavor a bit more. I will use this recipe again and again! Thanks for posting :)"
42720,14325,2004-03-14,5,"In an attempt to lower the fat, just a little, I made this recipe using 1/4 cup canola oil and 1/4 cup applesauce in place of the 1/2 cup butter.  I also decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup. The muffins still rose beautifully and they tasted so orangey delicious. This will be a keeper in our home!
"
513039,183769,2008-11-28,4,"This is similar to what I remember eating growing up served on a piece of lettuce. I made this last year and forgot to review. It was way too sweet for our tastes. I decided to make it again this year but reduced the sugar by 1/2cup. Also I used a 12oz. bag of cranberries (could not find 1 lb.) so that probably made a difference. It is good, but my family barely touches it- just too sweet I guess. That sounds funny when you have 5 kids eating it, though! I give it 4 stars because it was what I was looking for, but my family was not thrilled with it."
346576,24054,2007-04-18,4,This was on the menu for dinner tonight and we all loved it!!  The sauce had perfect sweetness.  We really enjoyed this recipe!  Thanks!
465829,226115,2008-11-24,5,"A very good stuffing indeed. I always used the gizzards without knowing what I was doing anyways. I so wanted to, but held myself back from adding thyme and rosemary. I did however, add it to the turkey after stuffing it ;) I normally do not like to stuff a bird because of my fears of contamination, but I am alive today to make the report, so I think it was fine. I loved adding the bacon to it, it added such a great flavor to the whole thing and a richness to the gravy as the drippings made their way to the pan. I will make this again, but I can't promise to hold myself back again from throwing some garlic and pepper in there! Made and Enjoyed for Please Review My Recipe tag - Thanks! :)"
141012,95531,2006-12-30,5,"Dec 29 2006 : I use this recipe often, but bake it for several hours as described in Mean Chef's pulled pork recipe. I don't let it get to the shredded pork stage. As soon as I think it is easy to slice and tender, I remove from oven. Thanks for sharing your recipe."
2001678737,97496,2017-08-19,0,"Hi everyone, I am going to attempt this today. I am wondering is using a hand mixer necessary or am I able to just mix everything together with a mixing spoon? Also, I have read so many reviews stating you can substitute the cream of tartar and baking soda with just baking powder, will this at all change the way the cookies will come out? I am making this as a gift so I want them to come out perfect, thanks for the help!"
44589,65886,2007-06-04,5,very good!! I used this with my grilled chicken.  I made extra and stored it in a tight container to use as a quick sauce/glaze and it kept for several weeks!
187373,262510,2012-06-30,3,"Sorry, but this was not very tasty.  Made as is except used a can of Campbell's with a can of water.  Turned out to be a glutinous mess that didn't have much taste. Maybe parbroiling the rice as I've seen with other recipes would help? But definitely needs more seasoning too."
336058,386623,2009-12-11,4,"This was quite good and healthy.  Just the right amount of sweet/tang.  I had a small squash, so used 2 apples.  The only hard thing about this is peeling that darn squash. Grrrr.  Made for Everyday is a Holiday."
226863,85089,2009-06-02,5,"Very light and fluffy fried seafood beignets.  They were like tempura...very light and fluffy.  I chose this because I have way too many eggplants from the garden, and this was a very unique way to use them.  A bonus...my DS ate eggplant and enjoyed it for the first time!  I used Virginia Cherry Blossom's Recipe #373985 373985 because I really like capers in my remoulade sauce, plus she is a Senorita!!  Made for ZWT5."
837451,69173,2009-07-18,5,These are fantastic!!!
204024,384132,2009-09-12,5,"Quick, easy, filling, and tasty, this is convenient comfort food, not a gourmet specialty.  We made it with Recipe#198485 instead of the canned Manwich. With two of us working different hours and one in the high school band, this was thrown together by DS at home and ready for all when needed.  Leftovers were packaged for portable lunch. Made for Pick A Chef."
340776,70165,2009-01-19,5,"This is a great basic crust recipe. It definitely does need some extra flavor. I used some garlic powder, but probably should have used more. Still, the crust was thin and crispy and we really enjoyed it, which is enough to earn 5 stars from me! Thank you!"
38513,12660,2009-07-12,5,"Made this for breakfast today and it was awesome!  I used what I had handy - some coppa, tomatoes, mushrooms, parsley, green onions, chevre and five eggs - was making this for more than one person!  It was all gone pretty quickly."
13593,33362,2003-12-08,5,Fantastic dish.  Easy to prepare and delicious too.  The flavor and texture of this dish is wonderful.  
200728,10780,2006-02-08,5,Yummy!
381180,387835,2010-03-05,5,"A GREAT blend of flavors!  I only had five small tomatoes, used 8 ounces feta cheese, 1/2 cup sliced green onions, and a 15 1/2 ounce can of chickpeas, then made as per the recipe.  Made for Cool Beans! recipe tag in the Photo Forum, March 2010."
41809,52689,2003-11-06,5,"I have to tell you, Girl, this is some kinda sauce.  I used it in Sweet and Sour Skillet Chicken, and it's the best I've ever turned out.  Bottled chili sauce pales in comparison.  It's easy and fast to mix up with stuff I keep on hand anyway.
Thanks for sharing, PB...I'll be using your recipe often."
91867,72303,2004-02-29,5,"Oh my goodness!  These were incredible!  I added White Chocolate chips in for a little contrast and flavor.  They were perfect!!!  My DD and I gobbled them up faster then we probably should have, but my DH wasn't as thrilled to be having chocolate for breakfast.  That just means more for the girls!  :-)
I did have some batter left over - can you beleive it?? - and I made them into rectangle pancakes so I could make ice cream sandwiches with them.  I have no doubts that my DH will eat them that way.  
The recipe was a little more time consuming than my regular pancake recipe, but certainly well worth it.  This will be great for special occasions...like breakfast.  My one problem with the recipe was that I didn't know when to add the milk.  When I got to step 9, I added the rest of the ingredients except the milk - so I thought that it had been accidently left out.  I didn't see that it was hidden in step 11.  As you can tell though, the pancakes turned out great even though I added the milk in the wrong place.  
Thank you for this recipe - it was so good!"
1287831,56925,2010-02-10,5,"We went to a great restaurant(Pumpernickel's) in Lake George, NY area over the summer.  When we went back home, we were craving the goulash.  Thanks for satisfying our craving."
8688,132535,2006-05-20,5,"This made a fabulous addition to our filet mignon.  The lemon and parsley was wonderfully flavorful and an excellent compliment to our filets.  We grill filet mignon often and I know we will be having this recipe again.This is super easy to whip up quickly having all the ingredients always on hand.  Thanks so much, NimrodCook!"
873985,36172,2008-06-26,5,YUM!!! I didn't have hominy or chicken broth...but substituted with cream of chicken soup and nixed the sour cream. I added Paprika and Ginger....this is delicious! My husbands had 3 bowls!!
1149293,8972,2009-02-11,5,I used real butter and made cupcakes with the batter and they were great. The frosting was perfect! Almost like a whipped cream but a thicker.
67899,56287,2003-08-07,5,"This is a delicious and healthy snack! I've eaten bananas in milk for years, but never thought to try it with peaches. As a peach lover, this was a great revelation! I actually had to use vanilla soy milk, because even lactose-free milk bothers me sometimes, and as a result I used slightly less sugar. I ended up pouring in almost all the peach juice, and it really hit the spot! Thanks for a great snack, Angela!"
542673,139170,2009-04-05,5,Awesome chicken salad.  Substituted diced jalapenos for the jalapeno relish.  Otherwise made as listed.  Will be making this on a regular basis.
80778,113097,2005-04-12,5,"Definitely easy and definitely tasty.  I've never tried kahlua before, so I wasn't sure what to expect; but I like to try different things.  I'm very glad I tried this, and I'll be making it again when I need a speedy dinner.  I thickened the sauce at the end, and it made a nice gravy for the chicken and a baked potato.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
174096,481041,2013-01-21,5,"This is great!  Loved the little bite, the smokiness, and the sweet-salty balance.  Thanks for sharing!  Veggie Swap"
444132,1600,2009-06-07,5,"These were fantastic!  The recipe is really easy, and I'll definately make it again.

**Updated** ~ Made these again, using 1 cup frozen blueberries and 1/2 cup frozen raspberries - delish!!!

Thanks AGAIN!"
286566,248008,2009-07-25,5,"Made this for the DH to take to work for morning and afternoon teas (does 12 hour shifts) and he declared it definately closer to a 5 than a 4 - high praise from him.  He does not like his cakes iced and they also have to freeze well as I bake slice and freeze and he chooses what he want s to take and this passed all the tests - definately a OAMC recipe.  In the preparation I put the butter, sugar and milk in a 4 cup microwave proof jug and put on full (900W) for 2 minutes, removed and then stirred to mix everything and melt the last of the butter and proceeded as per recipe using the jug, though it was only as I put it in the oven that I realized I had not added the rum essence, so stirred it in and into the oven at 170C fan forced for 45 minutes (could possibly have done with a couple of minutes less - will check at 40 minutes next time, I baked the cake in a 8x8 square pan but the smell as it was cooking was wonderful and when cutting it was moist but with a rich denseness about it.  Thank you katew for the best chocolate cake recipe yet to pass the DH's tests, made for Everyday a Holiday."
226066,261263,2007-11-11,4,"Made 9 muffins out of the mix.  Used margarine instead of shortening and did add more orange juice (as Boomette suggested) as the batter was very thick.  Added some dried cranberries to the mix.  Nice breakfast muffins, not to sweet!  Thanks Lavender Lynn! :)"
239758,312573,2012-02-09,5,"Fantastic salad with a wonderful combination of flavours and textures. I used 500 grams of fresh beets that I chopped and roasted in the oven with a few cloves of garlic. After draining the lentils, I gave them a quick rinse which got rid of the dingy colour left by the cooking water. I served this as a side dish and there was more than enough for six people. Thanks for posting. I was tickled to notice that my bag of French lentils had the same recipe on the back. In future, I'll pay more attention to recipes on packaging."
119466,155480,2007-02-17,5,"These are attractive, delicious, and fairly simple to make. Rolling and cutting out cookies is not one of my favorite things, but the dough was easy to work with, and decorating them as described was a relatively easy way to make them look pretty. It got difficult to dip them as directed when I got to the last few, so I just drizzled the white chocolate over those. I ended up with 19 cookies using a 3-inch cookie cutter. Thanks for posting the recipe!"
247780,30813,2008-04-19,5,"Beautiful bread. Totally worth the effort. I used fresh dill, b/c i grow it. I divided the dough in half, and with one I made a braided loaf (stunning) and with the other I made 6 mini loaves (for picnic sandwiches! stunning with ham :)) cut up like the recipe describes. I'm going to try to add a picture. Thanks! Might cut the sugar next time...and I will be making again with wheat flour...maybe a bit of garlic? ACE Recipe though, well worth your trouble!

Sorry about the pic quality, did it with my camera phone...doesn't do justice!"
629158,3094,2008-07-10,5,This has been my favorite sugar cookie recipe for a while now.  There was a time when i would use Earth Balance butter for this recipe instead of butter and the dough was always really dry so the cookies would hold there shape perfectly.   When i used real butter the dough was  very soft and didn't hold a crisp shape in the oven.  They still taste great and are soft.  Still a favorite.
2002061790,27208,2018-03-19,3,"I made this recipe as written but substituted the ranch seasoning for onion soup per other reviews about it being too salty. My family did not like this recipe at all. Iâm thinking it was maybe the wine in this recipe that threw it off (I used red cooking wine so maybe thatâs why?). I thought the reheated leftovers had a much better taste than the original meal. Over all, I think it was an okay meal to try, but we will not be making this one again."
422893,181857,2008-02-12,4,"Nice combo, I also added a bit of red onion for a little bite & used baby spinach leaves instead of lettuce, would be good with strawbs added too. Thanks for posting!"
212417,55673,2006-06-14,5,"This was the juiciest chicken I have had in a while!! The flavor was GREAT too! Even my DH, who is not a big balsamic vinegar fan, really loved this chicken! So easy and so good....my kind of recipe! Thank you so much for posting!!"
1962,117646,2005-04-19,5,This sounded so good and it was wonderful!  It is rather zippy so if you don't like hot stuff this isn't for you.  Tried to get my 7 YO to eat it but no go for him but the rest of us just loved it.  I could only find a 750 mL jar of pepperoncini peppers so I used half of that and since I didn't have an au jus mix I used  half a green peppercorn sauce mix (38 g) envelope.  I think using a whole envelope would have made it too salty since it was about right for our taste.  As soon as I saw this recipe I just had to try it and am soooo glad I did.  Thanks for posting!
37449,424775,2012-05-14,5,"Yum, love spinach and this was a nice and easy way to eat it. Thanks! Made for the Greens game in the Diabetic forum. :D"
152393,77476,2004-12-21,4,"I also used rum extract with mine and next time I think I may use a little more.  Also they did seem a little on the dry side but after rolling them in sugar they are easy, pretty addition to my Christmas cookie tray.  Thanks for submitting them, Rita."

126418,65986,2004-02-29,5,Ironically as I read this recipe I'm sipping on some fresh-brewed iced tea to which a packet of strawberry kool-aid and a cup of sugar were added. I actually got the recipe from another recipe site. Just thought I'd drop a line to tell all how dee-lish and refreshing! 
216058,99272,2008-12-14,5,"I have made this 3 times now and they never last more then a day.  Be careful not to play too much with the dough when rolling out.  It seemed to get tough this last time. Also, it is fabulous with the cream cheese icing....stepping it up a notch."
117438,8798,2004-06-02,5,"These were wonderful! I halved the recipe, and used fresh herbs. It was so easy to pull together, it was fantastic for a weeknight. I used instant lasagne and soaked them briefly in boiled water to soften. We will definitely make again, I am always looking for tasty, healthy recipes. "
179133,310967,2012-05-08,5,Yummy! I had recipe #290736 on hand so used that and no tomato slices since the sauce has some chunks in it. Used cheese I had on hand also which was Monterey jack and provolone. Thanks for sharing!
1677099,153067,2012-02-11,0,I never would have thought to put Dijon or any mustard on pasta.  This combination is really tasty.  I only had yellow and green peppers.  Quick an easy.  I started the pasta and then the rest.  They were done together.
604782,159780,2008-05-07,5,delicious!!!!i love chocolate!!
317696,57919,2007-02-09,5,This was very tasty and very quick to throw together.  I didn't make any changes and I won't be making any in the future.  Why mess with perfection?
290578,45963,2007-05-18,5,"I made these cookies for the second time recently, and made a few changes.  I used about 2 3/4 cups flour, just 1 cup of brown sugar, and  for the eggs (I didn't have any) I used 1/2 cup oil.  I used an eletric mixer, which made the texture quite delicate and almost shortbread-y!  My mom said they were the best cookies she's ever had :D  They turned out soft and chewy and had a nice round shape!  next time I'll take photos.  thanks for the great recipe!"
562865,139518,2009-01-28,3,"I found the cake to be very dry, although it had a nice flavour."
452355,234885,2010-10-29,4,This was a nice side dish to the chicken fajitas recipe that I made tonight.  I used fresh tomato from the garden and I followed the ingredient list as posted.  It has just the right amount of heat.  I thought it needed salt.  I used a combination of beef and veal stock.  Thanks for posting!
1377630,82486,2009-10-26,5,"Wow. I cannot believe how incredibly easy this banana bread is to make, and the result was super moist, perfectly sweet, and full of banana flavor!! I also used sour milk. Thank you for the post."
120108,239333,2009-05-18,5,Very good. Thank you for posting
647389,255852,2008-01-06,4,Very nice! Even the day after.
200862,462021,2012-10-09,5,"Made for PAC 2012. We love shrimp (or prawns, as we call it -- to us ""shrimps"" are those tiny cocktail ones!). This was great. I made the sauce first, then mixed the spices. I thought it might not be quite enough even for the 500 g (just over 1lb) large shrimps I used, so I made a little more than specified. I had to use my oven grill, as it was raining again here ... (yikes). Thanks for a great recipe!"
1513099,136829,2010-01-13,2,I used a dark Belgian ale with the beef steak and for some reason the end result ended up tasting bitter and gamey. Might have been better with a slightly sweeter beer.  After making it I can't understand purpose of flouring the beef. The sauce had a nice consistency.
95743,81419,2004-05-24,5,Excellent minestrone and sooo easy.  My kind of recipe.  Hard to believe you can have so much flavor in just 40 minutes but it's true.  Used broth instead of water but otherwise didn't change a thing.   
29956,33147,2003-05-21,5,"I love chickpeas and this salad was
delicious, quick and using foods that I always have on hand. Not a thing to change."
51652,34108,2009-10-08,4,"Easy and pretty good.  I did make a few changes and will make another next time.  This time I used chili-ready tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes.  I used a can of chili beans, juice and all, in place of the kidney beans.  At first I cut down a little on the chili powder since there was extra flavor in the tomatoes and beans, but after simmering a few minutes I decided that it needed the full amount of chili powder after all.  I also added a bit of cumin since I read others had done that.  The flavor was great.  The one thing my family complained about was the pasta.  I put in more than called for, but next time I will add even more.  Even so, they ate it all.  No leftovers.  I'll make again."
64667,316463,2008-12-02,5,"Made this for a church fellowship potluck when we moved our new vicar & family into their home; had TONS of compliments and requests for the recipe!   The extra casserole comes out of the freezer & into the oven very beautifully, too.   I used a quart of home-made tomato sauce--jazzed it up with dried herbs (in place of the 25 oz jar of spaghetti sauce.    Snip the pepperoni with a kitchen shears--quick work!  *KEEPER!*"

60231,113006,2005-11-04,5,"Oh,YUM. What else can I say? It it easy and has such a great flavor. We all loved it and I will definitely be making this again.(and again...)Thanks for a quick,tasty dinner treat."
128473,24085,2010-07-31,2,"I am so sorry, I so wanted to love these, as I was making them as a special gift for a close friend that was moving.  These are her favorite cookies.  The flavor was there, but the recipe didn't work for me at all.  I made these cookies twice, the first time I cooked at 325 for 20 minutes and they weren't edible.  The second batch I cooked at 300 for 10 minutes and most of them weren't edible.  The six cookies that didn't turn dark brown, were good, the flavor was lovely.  The icing and cherry really complimented the cookie.  I used a seedless strawberry jam as the filling. I took 3 stars away, because, one they burned, two they were difficult to work with, rolling out the dough was difficult and three because I believe that they need more flour and a little less butter or maybe some chilling time is required. I will certainly try these again, but will experiment with the ingredients.  Thank you for sharing."
311926,118828,2009-12-23,2,I'm not a fan of radishes so I'm sure that's why I didn't care for this recipe. I think I ran out of rice vinegar and ended up using half rice vinegar and half regular. I'll give this a try again if I get more radishes from my CSA but it's not something I'll crave : )
5060,7944,2002-02-11,5,"This brushetta was just excellent!! I cut the recipe in half for 2 of us, used French bread cut diagonally, added two garlic cloves, smashed, to the onions and I know it's supposed to be low cal, but I couldn't resist, I drizzled olive oil over the toasted bread, heaped the mix on and sprinkled with asiago cheese and under the broiler it went. It will be done again and again!!! Thanks Recipezaar!!!"
245653,138296,2005-10-10,5,I loved this easy recipe! I was able to come home from work and put it together in like 10 minutes!!! The taste was excellent.
179133,234168,2012-03-31,5,Yummy treat for Saturday breakfast! I used light margarine spread instead of butter. It didn't get as browned as I expected but that could be my oven or because I used margarine instead of melted butter. It tasted great anyway though! I've never made cinnamon-sugar with brown sugar and I liked the change. Thanks for sharing! :)
461834,401451,2012-01-02,5,These are fantastic!!!  Dh and I grilled out steaks last night for our News Years Day dinner and this really made the steaks extra special!!!  I made 1/2 of the recipe for the 2 of us.  These onions reminded me of a steak that was made with brown sugar and spices (which made a crisp outside coating) at the Hyde Park Restaurant.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for your win in the 12 Days of Christmas Surprise Event.
724516,353990,2009-02-20,5,"I didn't get much time to make a lot of the recipes for RSC #13 but this one was so quick and easy and made fantastic cookies, just like carrot cake but I think keep much better. the kids loved them and my grandson is very picky. I gave it 5 stars because we liked them a lot and I wouldn't change a thing. Actually the longer you keep them the better they are."
283483,63812,2007-01-21,5,"I love the flavor of this mix. I sprinkled it over our homemade pizza before baking and it was great. I also made some Italian breadsticks and sprinkled this on top. Can't wait to make it into a salad dressing. 
Updated: I mixed this into a dressing and it was delicious. I used olive oil. My husband prefers this over store bought."
103759,19344,2003-09-12,5,Excellent!  I made this dish for a pot luck at work and everyone raved about it!  There wasn't any left!
2727256,83008,2016-12-30,0,"I cooked this 10 hours on low, and it came out perfectly! I used a ham bone with plenty of meat, so it was more like a stew consistency. I added some half and half to make it creamy. My husband will want this one again soon!"
1421140,266939,2011-02-07,5,Served this for super bowl and everyone raved about it. I followed the recipe as it was printed. Reviews said it made delicious sandwiches but I didn't have any left over to test that!  Will definitely make this again
887204,23429,2008-07-29,5,I love looking for older recipes. This one was wonderful. It tastes a lot like a fruit sherbet type ice cream. Not a bite left over.
3775,5158,2000-12-11,3,Ok
1124480,311788,2009-01-11,5,I saw this on Diners Dive and Drive Ins too and started searching the web for ideas.  I made this pretty much the same way you did but with Challah (egg) bread.  It was AMAZING.  One of the few times you try something and it's just as good as you'd imagined it to be.  Thanks!
32772,62567,2003-08-22,5,"Lubie, this recipe is one of the best recipes I have made on zaar (and I have made many, LOL). The recipe was easy to follow and produced the best BBQ chicken I have ever eaten. I only made one change to the recipe. I didn't cook the onions in water. Instead, I placed it in the skillet with chicken so that the flavor from the onion would infuse more in the chicken. This is a recipe that you can make on the nights you don't have a lot of time to cook or just don't feel up to cooking. Next tme, I will make it in the crockpot and cook it for 4-6 hours on low.  Thanks so much for this recipe."
163112,429759,2010-06-21,5,i didn't have asmall onion but I did have a large shallot so I used that.  we loved this - will double next time.  1/2c cream would have been sufficient.  made for zwt6.  thank you!
284897,223679,2010-04-01,5,"This is one great recipe, I can vouch for it as it was my mother's recipe originaly and  Polly Waffle has poached it from me. I made this recipe today for a Good Friday dinner but substituted the Salmon for Tuna. I also baked these in the oven. These turned out perfectly!
Thanks for posting a great family recipe Polly Waffle"
708130,53328,2008-07-21,0,I added chick peas and kidney beans.  Used rice wine vinegar and walnuts instead.  This salad is amazing...quick and easy and DELICIOUS.
38182,31632,2003-06-15,5,"Kimke! So glad I gave this a try, it was just what I was hungry for. The seasings were perfect and it was an easy recipe! I had to cut down on onions because I'm allergic to them but they added such a nice flavor.  I'm going to make this again today! Thanks for sharing."
58104,231135,2007-09-08,5,"Bev, When I saw the Cuban mojitos meet Hawaii I just had to try! 
 I made for one using only 1 Tablespoon sugar, juice from 1 whole lime, 1/4 cup mint leaves, and for the rum I used 1/2 of a cup which is 4 liquid ounces!!!!!!! That is what this recipe calls for per person! I muddled the lime, mint and sugar topped with as much ice I can fit into my mojito glass. Then! A MUST top with seltzer which is not called for in this recipe. This is a great refreshing buzz and I rated according to my makings!  Bev I love the twist of using coconut rum. Thanks."
204024,476656,2013-07-08,5,Really delicious and flavorful!!   This made a great dinner for us tonight!!  Made for PRMR.
93095,89819,2004-05-17,4,"This was a very good slow-cooked meal.  I didn't use the hominy, collard greens, or spinach because I don't care for them.  I sliced some baby carrots and added them.  The cajun seasoning really adds a nice ""kick"".  Thanks for this recipe!    "
145352,188958,2009-02-02,4,Good and went together very quickly. Thanks!
1461159,367439,2009-12-27,0,SO good - I tweaked it so I could do it in the crockpot for a day-after-Thanksgiving game night .  Everyone loved it.
47892,33454,2008-10-25,4,"I also played around with ingredients according to what I had on hand: an extra-zingy gorgonzola for feta (threw in some Parmesan, too), Brandywine toms for the cherry toms, heavy cream for the creme fraiche. I didn't wilt the spinach but rather chopped up in thin ribbons, placed in pie pan and drizzled olive oil on top. Also, sliced up part of a Walla Walla onion and placed on top of the toms. The Brandywines, which I bought today out at the farm, are a good tomato choice for this recipe because they hold their shape well. Fresh chives from the garden were added after quiche was done so that the color was retained. Easy to make and very delicious. Served with plain saffron rice and steamed corn. Lastly, made my own pie crust. Thank you!"
1150951,89204,2009-03-04,5,"Delicious recipe, and possibly the easiest one ever!

I had this with Spanish Rice (Uncle Ben's) and it went perfectly with this meal, I recommend the rice for a side dish.

I used fresh chicken instead of frozen.

I modified the cooking time slightly because I was away all day and didn't want to the cooking to finish by noon. I set my crockpot to low heat for 6 hours and then left it on warm for 6 hours - this timing worked out perfectly for me.

Will definitely make this again. I am also planning to make burritos out of the leftover chicken and sauce."
461834,381269,2009-07-28,5,"OMG this is awesome!!!  I just loved creamsicles when I was young and still do!!  This was a perfect treat for this afternoon!!  I didn't add any sugar as I felt with the ice creams and juice it was sweet enough for me!!  I could have this everyday, well except for the calories, but a great treat!! My 17 yo DS was out golfing and missed this and now wants me to make it again!!  Thanks for posting this recipe Lainey!!  I only made it for one and didn't really measure, but it worked out great!!  Made for Photo Tag!!!"
4470,302751,2009-05-28,5,"5 star all the way - Great tasting, attractive potato recipe.  I used little new white potatoes, no olive oil - just a spray of ""No Oil"" and they browned  beautifully  Thanks Jo for a keeper"
469831,261382,2007-12-08,5,"This couldn't have been easier! I mixed it exactly as directed, but it seemed a tad bit dry so I added another 1/4 cup milk. Super yummy! Even my picky 12-year old daughter came in asking what that yummy smell was! LOL Will definately make again and again! Thanks for posting! :)"
313705,189571,2007-01-16,5,"This is the yummiest thing ever, even better than the local socca previously sold at Socca Oven in Berkeley. Love the onion and rosemary  addition- I couldn't have it without it now! I top it with hummus, olives, or whatever I have on hand. YUM YUM YUM!"
305531,305026,2008-06-16,5,Yummy! This was so simple and so tasty. Thanks Sue. Made for ZWT4.
234062,32511,2007-03-11,5,This lovely recipe adds so much to a Sunday afternoon lunch! It brings much needed colour to the plate and leaves you feeling healthy after all the stodge of the potatoes and parsnips! Recommended and will definitely make again!
368222,62700,2007-03-02,5,"This was incredible bread.  With the ingredient at home I had to substitute a few.  I used organic brown sugar, 1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 cup organic vanilla yogurt, and unbleached white flour.  I also put the walnuts on the bottom of a greased loaf tin so they would bake into the top.  I omitted the lemon rind since I did not have any.  When it was finished I inverted the bread so the walnuts were on the top and made a topping of 1/4 cup of melted butter and some organic sugar to drizzle over the top.  It formed a yummy crusty top.  I will probably always use this recipe from now on.  Thanks SOOOO much!"
174096,336622,2008-12-22,5,Refreshing and simple!  This was a very fresh and delicious salad.  I omitted the salt (personal preference).  Great the next day too.  Thanks for sharing!
63128,101619,2004-12-09,5,"Wonderful texture and taste! More creamy than eggy, which is my husband's preference. I didn't pre-bake the frozen crust.  Just layered the bottom with extra sharp cheddar, four diced slices of ham, and poured the egg mixture on top. It cooked in the same amount of time (40 minutes). Next time I'll use an extra half cup of cheese since we like things super cheesy!"
384041,282997,2008-02-22,3,"I loved the generous portions that made this a REAL meal. A doubled recipe fed 2 adults, 2 teens, and a toddler. The use of both regular and sundried tomatoes made it nice and rich too. But it didn't quite live up to its potential because the flavor was rather one-dimensional. IMO, it needs garlic and another herb, perhaps oregano, to add depth and complexity. Additionally, DH complained that the cayenne on top was like finding landmines -- it might have been better added along with the basil so that the flavors would meld. It would have been a 4-star though except that the author messed up the fresh-to-dried basil conversion. Even using the regular conversion of 1 tsp dried basil for each tbs fresh the flavor was overpowering. If I'd used 6 tablespoons of dried basil in the doubled batch it would have been like eating pesto out of the jar with a spoon. In a regular review I'd just have noted the error and given it the 4 stars but since its a contest entry I can't rate it as highly as I'd rate a recipe that written correctly. Sorry. :-("
2001378820,56748,2018-02-15,0,How about this recipe in microwave
166642,278914,2008-09-16,5,This is great and easy to make! IT was wonderful to have to snack on during the football games this past weekend. Made for Pick A Chef Fall 2008.
176706,12369,2008-09-23,5,"WOW!  We loved this.  I used 1 can cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom, added some black pepper and parsley to the ""sauce"".  That was the only change I made and it came out perfect!  I was told ""you can make this any time you want! Mmm!"".  Thank you for a great recipe :)"
265375,362486,2009-11-02,5,I followed this recipe but ran out of oil. I used some applesauce instead and I'm sure there wasn't a difference as the cake was a hit. I whipped up heavy cream with some sugar and vanilla for the frosting. Easy to make and delicious to eat.
846280,181106,2010-09-22,5,Love it!  Best Whole Wheat Bread ever!
224170,48913,2008-05-29,3,"I made this exactly as written except for soaking the beans overnight and cooking in a crockpot for 8 hours on high.  The gravy consistancy was wonderful, the beans were perfectly cooked, and the meat fell off the ham hocks.  That said, I was put-off having to fish out the bones, cartilage, and other ham hock detritus from the beans.  My boys were grossed out when each bit into a bone chunk that I had missed.

We did not find it spicy enough, even with my liberal measurments of cayenne pepper and hot pepper sauce.

If I were to make it again, I would definatly use cut up pieces of cooked ham or sausuage instead of the ham hock.  I would also double or triple the spices."
28636,197203,2009-04-24,5,Sooooo good and sooooo healthy!!  We really enjoyed this.  I cooked the spaghetti squash according to the instructions in Recipe#77554 and then used Recipe#106631 rather than sauce from a jar.  Wonderful!!  This recipe makes eating healthy delicous!  Thanks hummingbird garden :)
17803,310687,2011-07-31,4,"This recipe was easy to make and had just the right amount of spices. It was finished off on top of the stove, not the oven. Sprinkled with cheese put the lid on the pan and cooked about 5 minutes longer to melt the cheese. One could substitute a 8 ounces of tomato sauce for the 1/4 cup water if you'd like a little more color. I think we will continue making the recipe as written. Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup"
766288,79944,2009-09-18,5,"Great recipe.  So easy, quick, and only three ingredients...how much better does it get.  I make it just like the directions and only added a few spices/seasonsings.  I sprinkled with the Provence seasoning.  The cream cheese along with the bacon kept the chicken moist.  My Frenchman husband enjoyed the chicken also.  It's a keeper :)"
143318,305900,2008-06-28,5,"Savory, salty, lip-smacking good! If all meatless meals were like this, there'd be a lot more vegetarians! This is one amazing sandwich. It's some work, but the relish and pesto can be prepared in advance. I grilled the veggies on the panini grill and pressed the entire sandwich in the panini maker at the end. You don't need to slice the portabella but do take the cap off. For four sandwiches, I needed four portabella caps, 1/2 eggplant, 1 zucchini and two red peppers. Made for the Italy stop on the Zaar World Tour."
1203830,69372,2009-08-24,5,"Making these for a bridal shower, and even though we haven't officially tried them yet, I can tell they are going to be awesome!! My mom and I were licking the bowl and spoon it was so good! It was so quick and easy to throw together, I think this is going to be one of my favorite new appetizers to make! Thank you so much for sharing.  OK I had to come back to add my input after the shower.  These are officially my favorite appetizer ever!  I had some leftover and I had to give them to a co-worker so I would stop eating them, they were THAT good.  Thank you so much for your fabulous recipe!"
224921,199326,2011-01-02,5,"I had to make a few modifications, but I followed the basic recipe, and it turned out exceptionally well!  I had some questions regarding the recipe, so I sent an Fmail (is that what it's called now?) to Uncle Bill and he was gracious enough to respond quickly, with just the answers that I needed.  I have made several of Uncle Bill's recipes and they are always top quality!"
55729,226802,2009-07-10,0,"I found as I was making these that I had no cream of tartar so I substituted an equal amount of baking soda (since I really had no idea how to fix it). I also decided to mix the dough up in the food processor since I am basically lazy. Made improperly, the flavor was pretty good but they were far too crumbly. I think they might be really good as the base for a breakfast cheese biscuit sandwich (heated with melted cheddar in the middle)."
213067,63031,2006-04-15,5,This is a great way to use rhubarb.The family loves it.I could eat it all 
337246,110507,2010-02-14,5,"This potato soup is easy and delicious!  Didn't have any ham so used bacon bits, they work great!  I shared with neighbors and they loved it!  We'll be making this every week as it's now one of my husbands favorite meals.  Made using 12 serves, shared with neighbor and still had plenty to freeze for quick meals.  It freezes great! Thanks for an awesome meal!"

828241,293694,2008-04-28,1,"Well, I tried your recipe.  I used olive oil instead of veg. oil, and it stuck like crazy to my pan!  I think I am going to try to bake this and see if it does any better!  Any suggestions anyone?"
523615,217753,2007-06-24,5,"used this as the salad at a Fraternal Organization dinner with Honey Glazed Pork Loin. Very easy, everyone wanted to know how I cooked the brocolli,told them you don't. Many wonderful comments. Big hit with the Ladies. Several recipe requests. Thanks"
651269,98034,2008-03-30,5,"OMG...this is an awesome recipe.  My supermarket did not have the french bread so I used the pizza dough as someone suggested.  My boys don't like reubens so I made the reuben for my husband and me.  For my boys I used roast beef, swiss and honey mustard.  They loved it!  Thanks!"
121985,50395,2004-09-28,5,I made these last night.  I bought a jar of sliced cherries and did as the recipe said.  Then i heated them up a tad in the microwave and drizzled some chocolate syrup on them and had them on top of ice cream.  Heavenly!
573325,256970,2011-11-09,5,"I made these nuts for my dad to nibble on at work or while watching tv and he really loved them. The sweet and spicy contrast is perfect in these and they're really crunchy with all that delish caramel. :) I loved how easy these were to prepare and how no fuss the recipe was. THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing a real keeper with us, Hanka. Ill make this again for sure!<br/>Made and reviewed for Aussie/NZ Recipe Swap #58 November 2011."

37449,74453,2004-10-09,5,I picked this recipe to try from the game Make Recipes in Your Cookbook and I'm so glad I did! This was very good on a mixed greens salad. Thanks Shawn!
242729,368707,2010-01-20,5,"Made EXACTLY as posted and VERY much enjoyed! Sorry, the one exception was the American cheese, which I subbed with Cheddar! In order to get around the wet spinach, you MUST drain it well and mix it WELL with the eggy bread and cheese mixture! Enjoyed as a light supper meal last night. Made for Veggie swap as a recipe-nap by me, the VIP chef of the month! Merci! FT:-)"
340503,38413,2007-03-17,5,"I gave this 5 stars since my girlfriends really liked it. I liked it except I didn't really care for the ginger, so I will try it next time with less of it or without it next time. I took the suggestion and sprinkled coconut on it, and that is a must! Thanks!"
480195,424536,2010-06-02,5,We liked that this dish has some zip to it. The blend of flavors is very good. It was quick and easy to make. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Made for ZWT6.
359220,43509,2008-10-31,4,"Doubled the recipe (had a lot of brown bananas to use up) and only got 21 muffins out of it by filling 3/4 full.  I too had the problem that the topping melted down and on the first batch, even started to burn until I covered them with some foil for the rest of the baking.  The topping formed more of a sweet crust rather than the crumbly type that I was looking for, so I'll need to play around with that, but otherwise, very easy and super moist.  Thanks for posting!"
740483,8574,2009-01-11,5,I grew up on these and LOVE them!
231507,338442,2010-01-06,5,"This is the way I like my rice!! DH and I both love this, my great aunt used to make it with evaporated milk, which only makes it richer. A wonderful recipe, thanks for posting!!"
104295,144148,2009-10-20,5,"I kept looking at this recipe thinking, how could a recipe with this much health have this many wonderful reviews?  Well, these bars are awesome!  I used frozen zuchinni from my garden (which I defrosted and then attempted to get as much water out of as possible), white wheat flour, and salted roasted cashews.  I also used regular peanut butter instead of natural since it was all I had.  These have a wonderful texture and bite.  Great taste, even my picky child loved them.  I'll be making these again.  Thanks!!"
106635,73704,2003-10-28,5,"YUMMY YUMMY MUFFINS!  I love sweet and gooey butter tarts and making butter tarts into muffins takes the guilt out of having this with my breakfast coffee... excellent recipe, everyone should try this at least once.  I had no problems with the syrup mixture, whenever cooking eggs over heat, the heat source needs to be kept low and steady.  Otherwise, add the eggs in after tempering.  "
399156,195908,2007-02-15,4,The whole family loved this.  Especially the kids.  Dead simple to make and tastes great.
62086,56969,2007-06-06,4,"Very good beans!  I made the recipe as directed, including the brand of beans.  The only thing I would change as some others have said is to cut down on the brown sugar, as it was just a bit too sweet for me.  My Favorite BBQ sauce is Sweet Baby Rays, and being that the sauce is sweet and adding the sugar it was just a bit over the top for me.  I like my beans both sweet and spicy, so I added a few shakes of tabasco sauce and it gave a nice kick to it.  Will make again with the sugar change."
452355,233651,2010-12-30,4,This was a really easy to make sauce to go over my leftover roasted pork tenderloin.  I used baby bella mushrooms which lent a nice flavor.  The roux makes for a thick sauce. Thanks!
1172513,102631,2018-05-04,5,"My family really likes the way this bread turned out. It has a great taste, crust and &quot;chew&quot;. The only change I made was substituting 2 Tbsp of Swerve for the 2 Tbsp of Splenda. One question though, what size bread machine is this recipe made for? My machine makes a 2 pound loaf and the resulting loaf that I got with this recipe didn't quite fill up the pan."
129333,261772,2008-08-15,5,it was good I did not have any Kidney beans so I used gonzo beans which was fine but it might be better with kidney.  I did not use the pepper either.  I also used canned tomatoes.
375329,201452,2012-07-26,5,"This is yummy!!! I was pleased that the texture was very much like Olive Garden's. Actually I think the texture was better! It stayed smooth and soft was a long time. At OG it sets up after awhile. Part of this could be because we used Smoked Gouda, Provolone, Mozzarella, and Parmesan. <br/><br/>We could not find smoked provolone or mozzarella but the Gouda was great! I love how you can do this in a casserole dish or individual. We threw in sun-dried tomatoes! Wonderful addition! <br/><br/>Makes a ton!"
305740,150863,2009-06-03,5,This is a great soup.  The only thing I do differently is I add some bacon.  To me Potato Soup just isn't complete without bacon.
591307,95068,2008-09-04,5,Great alternative to those high carb potatoes.  We really enjoyed these knowing they weren't going to add inches to the hips :) I used turkey bacon to make them healthier too.  I can't wait to tell my friends about this one. Thanks for sharing!
932620,155148,2010-06-01,5,These were a great way to eat up the broccoli!  I omitted the oil and added 2 more Tbsp. milk.  I think next time I will add in some powdered ranch mix and sprinkle a bit of shredded cheddar on top.  De-lish!
469903,347701,2010-09-23,5,Get out those BIG martini glasses - it's a biggie and a goodie! Love chambord and the vodka and cranberry juice accent the sweet liquor perfectly! Thanks for sharing :)
308961,175976,2007-06-24,5,"A great, tasty, easy recipe.  I used peeled prawns (just born lazy!) and put the whole thing together in no time.  Served with rice and salad it was a real winner.  Thanks for posting!"
1010338,80079,2010-01-09,5,"Made for Comfort Cafe - Winter Snow Queen Round 1/10.  This was a nice tea and mixed well with the apple cider.  The cider, honey and orange made for a nice mix of flavors and aroma.  I enjoyed hot.
Thanks for sharing such a pleasant tea, simple, yet flavorful tea."
1603535,223688,2015-12-14,5,I used boneless pork chops and cooked the potatoes and carrots separate.  I cooked the onions with the pork chops in the pressure cooker.  I also used olive oil instead of butter and it was delicious!
254614,136760,2006-01-07,5,"I chopped the cooked celery,carrots and onion into very tiny  pieces and added to the broth. I cooked the peppers in chicken broth before adding roux.Very good.You must stir/wisk constantly or it will burn as the roux thickens the bisque. It is filling, satisfying - pure comfort food and very easy to make."
256411,363571,2009-11-18,4,"let me begin by saying that I did not make this recipe exactly as written...1st I used a 24 oz. 5 serv. pouch of Perdue's Perfect Portions, Italian...2nd I used the lower sodium chicken flavored Stove Top...3rd I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom...4th I used leftover fat free chicken broth instead of the water...5th I added 1 tb. lime juice and 1 tb. minced garlic from a jar...I followed the basic prep, but cooked it on HI in a 6 qt. Farberware crockpot for 3 hrs, at which point it was beginning to brown around the edges & the chicken was completely cooked...It was very yummy, I had 2 servings, LOL...this recipe was a great starting point...next time I'll add vegetables b4 I add the stuffing...thanks for sharing!"
1946802,30081,2011-07-18,1,Didn't like it all! Sorry
168462,147296,2005-12-13,5,These are a very good easy bar to make. I made them exactly as written and loved them. Thanks for the recipe.
135870,117319,2005-04-16,5,I was the one who requested this recipe on the recipezaar community boards.  Roxygirl was kind enough to look in her magazines and post the recipe.  This is just too good.  I've made this recipe twice and these loaves do not last long in my house.  They didn't last long enough for me to put up any in the freezer.  I wish I could give it higher than a five star rating!
1188561,141983,2011-12-30,5,"This sauce is simple and classy. You can amp it up to your liking,  I can not imagine anyone who would not like this classic white sauce. I will say it takes a lot of stirring but worthwhile things take time.<br/><br/>If you decide to make this after work it is a good idea to pull up a chair next to the stove for stirring duty. It's worth the buy cost wise because a little goes a very long way. It's so thick and rich you will not be able to eat much of it (due to the great taste you will probably try to anyway). Yet it is so versatile you can make many different meals with it. If it thickens (left overs) you can add a little milk to thin it out - it will not change the taste just consistency."
208755,155018,2014-02-21,5,"Very delicious! I&#039;ve roasted broccoli in the oven before, and this has a similar flavor, but I liked this better. Next time I may add some garlic to roast as others suggested. Thank you for sharing this!"
50969,341097,2011-10-07,4,"I made this recipe for the 2011 Fall PAC Event. I made it as it was written and used apple pie filling for the topping. After tasting the pie part, I think that the next time that this is made I will add another 1/4 cup of sugar. I bet this would be really good using Peach Pie filling.Thanks for posting and "" Keep Smiling :) """
665614,88625,2008-03-13,5,"Really decadent!  I was worried at the amounts of alcohol, but it tastes wonderful.  However, I would not feed it to kids."
917282,69630,2009-01-25,5,this was a fantastic recipe!  i made this with kittencal's buttercream frosting and with some fondant recipes i found online...i got SO MANY compliments on this cake.  it is so moist and holds together so nicely. thank you so much for posting this!
95114,100404,2004-12-16,0,"My DH loved this recipe.  He is trying to each low fat.  I used whole wheat tortillas. Yum and Thank you!
"
364863,605,2012-08-14,5,I made the yorkshire pudding base for chicken pot pie and it was absolutely deliscious.  Very versatile recipe.  This will definitely go into my rotation.  I would love to make it the way it is posted but my husband doesn't like kidney. Nonethe less it's a 5 star recipe !!!
323186,306090,2012-07-02,5,"A very nice dish, quick and easy.  Rather than fresh tomatoes I used a can of tomatoes,  avoided salt,  and enjoyed :)   Lovely recipe, made for Alphabet tag.  Thanks for sharing,  dear prudence :)"
59064,75130,2004-01-01,3,"These rolls did not expand as much as I felt they should have but that may have been due to some uncharacteristically humid and cool weather.
I used this recipe to make hamburger buns and DH really liked them. I felt they were a touch sweet.
Check the colour after 15 minutes. Mine were looking a tad dark at 20 minutes."
1800125853,52757,2013-10-14,4,Really good recipe! My first time making ratatouille and both my wife
559021,173573,2007-08-12,2,"I might not of prepared this correctly, but the cheese left quite a bit of oil at the bottom of this dish.  It was ""ok"" but certainly not something I would serve again.

I follow each recipe the first time exact.  I am not sure if I even like Yukon Gold Potatoes as this was my first experience with them.  The recipe instructions were clear and the recipe over-all was VERY easy to prepare."
380547,126623,2006-12-13,3,"made as instructed except to halve recipe and add diced onion to sauage in pan. Easy to make and quick. Hubby, who doesn't like anything I make ate the whole pot. So he'd probably give it a 4. I thought the cheese was a bit overwhelming. After a serving, the cheese and potato seemed too thick. maybe next time I'll try a bit less cheese. But overall I would make again"
865653,286624,2010-02-11,4,"These turned out pretty despite the vague directions and misleading name...I used 12 ounces of white chocolate to the 2 tbsps of crisco, this ratio seemed to work well.  I also added a few drops of cherry flavoring to the red food coloring.  The chocolate set pretty quickly, but the darker and thicker (and prettier) swirls of red color took much longer to dry.  I did not attempt to cut out hearts, but instead broke the candy up into slabs.  I like that this was easy, fairly quick and looked like Valentines candy."
2001127734,18185,2016-08-14,5,"Love it! Easy to make. Initially had some problems rolling it out in the pie pan, but about 2 min with a roller or a glass and problem was solved. Thanks for a simple and tasty recipe!"
220348,403182,2010-01-01,4,"I like how this was easy to make and put together, and also quick and not time consuming. I did find that 8 cups of pretzels were too much, although the pretzels did very well in this recipe."
95743,82972,2005-10-25,0,I skipped the mushrooms but don't recommend doing that.  The resulting cauliflower had too much paprika without the mushrooms to temper it all.
63526,23143,2003-01-12,5,"Started to rate it a 4*.  But after adding 4 chicken bouillon cubes it was a 5*.  HERE's WHY: My stock was made by adding (while boiling the chicken) some wine, chicken, worchestershire, veggies, spices, garlic and a few other things.  So afer the first bowl we then added the cubes (mixed with 1/2 cup of water) to the soup pot and it was great!  Next time I think we will just use the CANS of broth instead.  Anyway, after the cubes it was perfect!  (I HAD PROBABLY LEFT SOMETHING OUT OF THE STOCK)"
407007,385611,2012-12-03,5,Classic yumminess! My kiddo loved this and so did I. I loved the cheese; that was a new addition for us! Thanks for sharing.
58104,351304,2009-02-04,5,"Lovely, Refreshing! I made this using white wine for the grape juice. Delish! Thanks Sharon."
22015,49590,2005-11-01,4,I made this as directed.   It seems to me to have a more oatmeal and walnut taste than apple.   
1172588,356040,2009-02-17,5,"very good, i added strawberries too :)"
85018,109603,2005-07-09,5,"What a wonderful sauce!!!!!  I used a Dundee's Honey Brown beer, wildflower honey and honey mustard and added the sauteed onions to the sauce!  Delicious!  Served this with a garlic buttered rice and a salad of sliced tomatoes, cukes, shallots and raw mushrooms.  A great meal-thank you for this delightful recipe."
2148336,287112,2012-01-30,5,"I made this recipe tonight with chocolate cake mix and diet cake, but I used a sugar free cake mix. Delicious and I'm sure this lowers the calories too!"
325816,168117,2008-09-18,4,I loved these cookies and kept on eating them. Unfortunately no one was helping me out which is very bad for two reasons 1) What is wrong with everyone ? 2) I hate dieting. I think my kids are perhaps used to a lighter rainbow cake and these were pretty dense and very moist. I can't explain it otherwise since they were so beautiful and yummy. Made for PAC Fall '08.
160974,67660,2005-10-12,5,"This was a tasty and assertive dressing for our spinach salad. Next time I might put in a hair less soy, since I felt it overpowered the maple flavor the bit (I like a sweet dressing). Roxygirl  â"
58836,88304,2006-05-10,5,Made these last night but I used pillsbury crescent rolls.  They tasted really good.  DH liked them so that's a plus.  Thanks!
37449,279941,2008-12-03,5,"Yum! I loved this cheesey casserole!  I did make some changes, some for my husband ,some for me. I left out the chicken and in place of it added peas, broccoli, grated carrots and more onion. I also left out the cumin, and  jalapeno. This was still delicious! Thanks Teresa."
289437,117372,2006-02-14,5,I doubled up on the ingredients for the sauce and it came out great.   It really did taste like The Cheesecake Factory's Miso Salmon. I highly recommend it!
27702,203028,2010-02-07,5,Delicious.  I even read the recipe wrong so used half a teaspoon Nutella and they were still wonderful (I'll do it right next time). This was the only way I could get DH to try Nutella - he fears trying new things : ) He asked me to make a double batch next time. Thanks!
587114,201195,2008-09-01,4,"Not being Jewish, I really can't vouch for the authenticity of this recipe, we were just looking for something different, but gluten and dairy free.  I made the first 8 or so jelly, and we weren't too thrilled with them actually.  However, I made the rest of them doughnut holes rolled in cinnamon and sugar, and they were sooooo good!  We'll certainly make these guys again!"
259532,13388,2008-05-15,5,"Excellent recipe!! I didn't follow it exactly- I didn't have any honey, and used two layers of cinnamon raisin bread.  Either way, it was fantastic, and very easy to throw together the night before a brunch.  One guest described it as similar to a maple bread pudding, and it got rave reviews from everyone! Thanks!!"
1641724,187731,2010-06-27,5,"Awesome!  I made this last night and put the finished product in a small tortilla like the tacos.  It was amazing!  I used more of the chili sauces to make it more consistent with Bone Fish's. My wife and I thought it tasted just like the Bone Fish Grill's Bang Bang Shrimp, and we just went there the other day.  The left overs are even more dead on, because the shrimp isn't as ""crunchy"" like they are when they first come out of the deep fryer. Plus, I think everything kinda like marinates together.  Two thumbs up on this one."
1545249,9533,2010-02-07,5,"Lots of work - not a ton, but it definitely takes the full 3 3/4 hours to finalize. I'm sure it gets easier as you make them more often. I'm not a from scratch baker except for cookies, so for pros these will be a breeze, I'm sure; but any amateur (like me) can also have great results! Had I realized these were monster rolls, I would have cut them much smaller to share with a large group such as a Sunday Small Group or a book club, because we will never be able to eat all of these! I think they'd be good with some cream cheese icing or some apple filling. (I know, I know - they must already be about 1000 calories a roll, but just some ideas to try) But, they are wonderful as is! I used a roasting pan instead of two pans, and it took just a couple of extra minutes to cook."
327989,217179,2007-12-03,5,Added 1 cup of blueberries and it came out perfect. Make sure you save the juice if your using frozen for the blueberry syrup! Make sure to use your mixer to get the fruit inside the pancakes to mix in and give up that wonderful blueberry taste.
1317887,15411,2010-03-14,5,INCREDIBLE!!!  The work-to-yumminess ratio is wonderful!
286566,131447,2009-01-09,5,Made a 1/4 batch as we cannot buy Ranch Dressing Mix in the supermarkets in Australia so I could make Shelby Jo recipe #317230 for Potluck Tag.  Thank you so much wildheart.
2357570,16169,2012-09-17,4,"I loved this recipe but I used lime instead of lemons. Really lovely, would make it again!"
441443,33919,2007-02-13,4,"This was good and I will definitely make it again. I as many others substituted the cream of mushroom soup with cream of chicken. I added salsa in between the layers. I chopped up lettuce, tomatoes, olives, green onions for toppings once it came out of the oven."
396157,76138,2010-05-04,5,This was so quick and flavorful.  A comfort food type of recipe.  Only change I will make next time is to completely omit the salt.  I only added a pinch and found it to be a little salty already.
527886,16702,2007-06-30,5,"Really good, and just about foolproof. With so much eggs, to my taste I can leave out the olive oil, and still have a nice moist, airy texture. I'm also using a nonstick pan, with no butter rub. Those two changes really drop the fat and calories. I use closer to 3 cups of zucchini, moisture removed. (Shred, sprinkle with salt, drain in a colander 10-15, then squeeze well.) I also decide 1/2 tsp of sugar couldn't possibly make a difference, so I leave that out, too."
216999,428026,2010-06-22,5,"Very easy to make and delicious, a new family favorite!  I used a roasted red pepper and a whole 14 oz. can of chicken broth.  Made for ZWT6 Family Picks."
227831,98636,2008-12-27,5,"I have made other copy cat recipes and my son and husband have been somewhat receptive but these were the most enthusiastically received. It's in the cookbook now.

12/2008 update.  I originally reviewed this in 2006 and it's a solid go-to recipe.  However, over time, I have reduced the sugar to 1 tsp and the other day I made them with buttermilk because I had it and that really gives them a delectable texture.  Nice to know you can do it either way.  These go together fast and are great with soup."
59473,100009,2004-09-22,5,I made this tonight for supper and it was excellent. The salsa and montery jack cheese really added lots of flavour. I did cook it for 10 min. longer than stated. Thanks for a great recipe.
149396,26049,2005-05-14,5,WOW How exciting!!  I have loved these sandwiches since I was a young girl.  These are really close to the ones you can get at Bennigan's.  I think the ones at the restaurant are more crispy.  I used smoked turkey (which I don't recommend) and Black Forest Ham (which was great).  I had to get my hands in the batter to smear it onto the sandwich.  It was very messy but very effective.  I also doubled the meat and cheese (or you could get it from the deli sliced thick) after making one sandwich and tasting it.  The flavor of the bread overwhelmed the meat and cheese using just one slice.  My husband and daughter ate the sandwich with grape jelly instead of raspberry and thought it was great that way too.  This is definitely a keeper!!  Thanks a million!!
308434,428860,2010-06-16,5,"Oh Suzanna....this is rich, creamy and soooo cheesy!  I did have to sub the gruyere for smoked gouda and the parm with grana padano.  Also added a wee bit of freshly grated nutmeg.  This is absolutely what I needed.  Says it serves 12...well....Dh and ate half for our dinner....lol  This will be my guilty pleasure once in awhile...as it satisfies my yen for good cheeses in one fell swoop!  Thank you for sharing!"
89831,215760,2007-09-17,5,"What an easy simple yet delicious recipe to use yellow squash, I did some amount adjustments and added in some cayenne pepper and fresh garlic, we loved this, thanks Killer!....Kitten:)"
607376,314702,2008-08-07,5,So Good!  My family LOVED this! YUMMY!
124416,138315,2005-09-22,5,"Wow!  Give your husband a hug from me.  A GREAT idea!  My apple pie has always been semi-famous locally BUT...this adds a real plus.  I admit that I didn't want to go downstairs to get the whisky so I used the brandy which was right at hand.  My, my, my.  Absolutely delicious!   (But NO nutmeg; I don't care for it._"
96177,311466,2008-12-13,5,"Great recipe for making holiday dipping healthy. Next time I will cut back on the cinnamon, I think it overpowered the honey. Will certainly make again. Tagged in Everyday's a holiday."
160974,222399,2007-11-18,5,"This was a hit with my daughter. Thanks Lvs2Cook, for posting.
Roxygirl"
50509,19177,2008-01-15,4,"This was well received. I was shocked to find I had no potatoes - not one - but I did have a rutabaga, which worked quite nicely and added color. I also used edademe instead of peas. Used bone-in chicken thighs and drumsticks and closer to a tbl. of curry powder. I would have liked the sauce to be a bit thicker, and next time I may try reducing it a bit in a saucepan. Mine was done after about 4 hours, I would say. I generally time chicken dishes for between 4 to 6 hours in the crock, as I think they can get overdone otherwise."
461834,53876,2007-04-05,5,"I made this for my son, as he loves Carrabba's bread and their dip.  This was great, he just loves this and now wants homemade bread and dip everyday.  Thanks for the recipe."
266635,433477,2015-07-06,5,These shortcake cups are so easy to make and really delish.  I took the advice of another reviewer and docked the pastry.  I cheated a bit and used refrigerated real whipped cream. : )  Will definitely make these tasty treats again soon.
464080,420677,2010-06-28,5,"WOW did I love this!  I subbed out Splenda for the sugar and halved the amount of oil (next time I will use even less oil).  I didn't have any honeydew, but it was fabulous even without.  Thanks so much for sharing this tasty lunch!  Made for Veg*n Swap July 2010."
51257,179371,2007-09-17,4,"i made this yesterday for a candle party I was hosting, and I didn't have enough dough/batter to drop onto the top.  I had a little left but found i needed more of it just to fill the bottom of my pan.  Mine set ok was kinda messy and very dry on the bottom I wasn't sure if it was done so I might have over cooked it.  It was still a hit and got eaten right up, I am just not sure if I would make it again."
107583,270178,2011-12-31,4,"These are very easy and really good.  I wasn't sure how the pecans should be prepared, so I ground them in my mini-processor.  Dough was easy to handle and liked the texture from the oats."
220403,66686,2007-04-09,5,"Decadently delicious and easy, too!!  I used Nestle Tollhouse cookies, & they come in squares rather than in a roll, and there are 24 to a pack.  They are thicker, so I baked them for a full 20 minutes in the first step, and also an additional 5 in the second (cream cheese) step.  Since I had 24 cookies, I made two batches.  I loved the chocolate/cream cheese flavors so much, that I melted 2 oz. of chocolate chips & 1/4 cup cream together and drizzled  it over the tops of the second batch instead of the cherries.  Both were tasty!  I made these as a thank you for some people and later overheard someone say they were ""a taste of heaven"", so they were a big hit, I think!  :)  Thank you so much, DiB's!!"
993604,115886,2009-07-19,5,"A nice, easy dessert. The hardest part is waiting 8 hours to eat it. I made two changes: I used 2 Sarah Lee poundcakes in place of the angel food cake (personal preference); increased the lemon yogurt to 12 ounces to make the cream mixture more lemony. Thank you for the recipe. Made for Summer Comfort Cafe 2009."
174096,392060,2010-04-13,5,"Delicious!  And quick and simple to prepare.  I love the sage sausage, and it worked quite well here.  Nice little zip, and the garlic was a great touch.  Thanks for sharing!  ~PAC Spring '10~"
60101,161909,2009-04-13,4,"I made this for my sis-in-law's birthday and frosted it with recipe #89207.  I didn't actually eat it myself (I don't like chocolate), but the in-laws said it was great - very moist.  I might add a touch of cinnamon to the batter next time, or maybe mix a little instant coffee in with the milk.

My only complaint was that the batter overflowed from my cake pan once it started to rise - even though I used a bundt pan of the stated size.  Next time I'll fill the pan less and make cupcakes out of the extra batter."
107583,82188,2010-03-21,5,"Delicious!  I cut the amount of soy sauce to 2/3 cup and replaced it with water, but may cut it to half next time and add more sherry.  Salmon cooked perfectly in the stated time (my fillets were skinless)."
379195,88430,2007-12-06,5,"My 1/2 German mom always made ""goulash"" growing up, which consisted of ground beef, shell noodles, Rotel and lemon pepper. Imagine my surprise when, as a young adult, I was served ""goulash"" at a dinner party only to find out that my mother's goulash in no way resembled the actual dish! Although I can appreciate the other ingredients now, I still get nostalgic when I hear the word ""goulash."" Thanks for posting!"
111291,72467,2008-05-07,0,"This is a true caramel lover's dessert! RICH and delicious! I used the fat free condensed milk and it worked fine. Made homemade graham cracker crust. Because I knew this pie would be sweet, I didn't add any sugar to the crust. I added some pecans on the top (about 1/4 c.), they complemented the sweet so well that next time will add more. I used the MICROWAVE to make the caramel and followed these DIRECTIONS: Pour 1 can sweetened condensed milk into a 2 qt. glass measure (use a bigger glass if doing 2 cans at a time OR WATCH CLOSELY - it may boil over; stirring frequently will help avoid this). Cook on medium (50% power) for 4 mins., stirring briskly every 2 mins until smooth. Cook on med-low (30% power) 18 - 25 mins. or until very thick and caramel colored, stirring briskly every two minutes until smooth."
4986575,407907,2014-05-20,4,"I have made this recipe since my kids were little (25 years or so).  I have to say that kids love this casserole! It is good if you like the taste of Campbell&#039;s Chicken Noodle Soup, as that is the brand of canned soup I purchase for this recipe. Instead of topping with croutons I slice the crusts off of buttered bread, cut the bread in fourths, and place the pieces butter side up on top of the casserole, fitting the pieces together like a puzzle to cover the whole surface.  Makes a great kid friendly casserole!"
60231,45244,2006-02-02,5,"Very good. We ate it all up, although next time I think I'll use spaghetti sauce, since the pizza sauce wasn't as well-received as I thought it would be.I did make one change. In addition to the Parmesan sprinkled on top, I added a slice of mozzarella to each one shortly before I took it out of the oven. Yum! This will be repeated.
 "
58104,211499,2007-03-18,3,This is like eating a carrot cake salad! I like the cinnamon (taking over in flavor) the sweet crunchy and tangy salad. The fennel did get lost in this. Needs to be seasoned with a generous amount of salt and some fresh cracked pepper.
51011,44007,2006-01-28,5,"I had this at a BUNCO party last night- It was so flavorful and good!  Only change was that they used flour tortillias (everyone here does that here in Tennessee, which is a bit odd to me being a Texan) and she added refried beans to stretch the meat layer since it was for so many people (13).  It was sooooooooo good! Thanks for sharing :)"
391467,217263,2007-03-24,5,"These were amazing! I cooked  for 15min, but should have only left them in for 13-15mins. Thanks for the easy and wonderful recipe!"
8377,288345,2010-03-07,5,"I adore onions so this recipe was calling my name. Very easy to make and so delicious. I did not deep fry them, instead I fried them in a fry pan in one-inch of veg oil. I love the warm color that turmeric imparts to dishes. The taste of the chickpea flour is wonderful. All in all, these onion bhajis were perfect. Thanks so much! Made for ""More Than Just Curries"" tag game."
444132,349731,2009-04-23,4,"This was really good, although both DH and I didn't find it cheesy.  For ease of prep, I threw it all in the breadmaker and set it to dough, which worked excellent.  It was like a crackerbread that would be awesome with dips (which is what I have in mind for it for tomorrow.)  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for Newest Tag."
455970,66976,2008-03-20,4,"I made this for myself one night and it was something I had never tried before. Good flavor, quick, and easy! I served it over white rice (not a big pasta fan). It was a bit bland, not sure what to add to flavor it up a bit?"
176615,29679,2005-04-11,5,"Really easy treat that everyone loves! This would be a great yet easy dish to bring to a pot luck or other function. I used a glass 13 x 9 dish, chilled well and didn't have any trouble getting them out. Thanks, Karen!"
430117,19710,2009-09-09,5,Served this on Labor Day with our BBQ and thought it was pretty darn good!
259154,26036,2006-07-28,4,"This was good. Made it ahead for a weekend camping. Couldn't find cream of coconut so I think I used flake coconut.  Turned out fine, but maybe a bit sweet.  You always have good recipes!  Thanks and God Bless."
310109,259920,2009-02-06,5,"The cake held up really well!!  I only decorate a couple of cakes a year so I'm far from a pro.  My mom made a bundt cake so we'd have extra - I ended up using the bundt cake and setting this cake ontop - it worked perfectly!!!  She had a bit of extra height to her.  I also took the legs off the barbie.  Just a note - if there are going to be little boys around - don't cut the cake from the back....Barie's bum hangs out if you do this, lol."
2000216260,502536,2015-05-21,0,"Thank you, this looks fantastic. I have found a nice trick for the base to keep it crispy and to really get the flavours of the tomato sauce out. Simplest, spread a little olive oil onto the crust before adding the sauce. Another good way, add a little sauce, let it soak in, spread a little olive oil over that and then add the rest of the sauce."
1803076805,138782,2015-01-09,4,"Received a beef kidney in my CSA and this was definitely a step above the Steak &amp; Kidney Pie I had in a pub in York many years ago.  Kidney will likely never be on my favorites list, but in my  Nose to Tail approach to food this is a great recipe.  I used some bacon drippings for the fat, added about a heads worth of garlic cloves (halved and added at the  end of the onion carrot saute), and some pork stock that was left from a pulled pork recipe, tomato paste for the puree and 1 T of low sodium Worcestershire.  If making again I would bake off the puff pastry separately and lay on top of the hot pie filling or substitute a standard pastry crust."
773381,100761,2008-05-13,5,This is my favorite marinade!  I've used it for lamb chops twice and for steaks two times now.  I love it and my kids can't get enough of the meat (steak or lamb!) whenever I use it. :) I've typically used balsamic vinegar as that's what I've had on hand and a touch less pepper so my young children don't turn their noses up.  Thanks for sharing!
755869,62564,2008-05-19,5,"I completely skipped the critter thing (my 13yo isn't really into that anymore) but wanted a yogurt dip.  This stuff was fantastic!  It was unfortunately a little on the runny side which made it difficult to stick to the fruit, so I think I might drain the yogurt before I make it again.  and I will definitely make it again! It tasted sort of like a peanut butter milkshake... yummm..."
90086,38085,2007-09-30,5,This is an excellent bread recipe!!
2000448376,459011,2015-09-02,5,"i loved this recipe! my bf and friends at them right up 
And then that night we warmed them up in the oven (just for a few minutes) and had some vanilla ice cream over them, it was absolute PERFECTION!"
148715,174022,2006-10-17,5,Made this for my PAC 2006.  The flavor was amazing.  I love the spicy zing you get after the sweetness of the melon.  Great salad to serve with a BBQ chicken.
227586,89523,2008-02-10,5,"Baby Kato, these brownie like gems were oh, so good! They were moist and I loved the pretty marbled effect that it had!  I made these in a square 8X8 pyrex dish, (baking time was longer, about 15 min. more, due to the pan size) and they came out taller than probably was supposed to, but what the heck, more to eat with a tall glass of milk!  The ribbon of cheesecake filling ran throughout the brownie which was so moist!  Loved the flavors!  Made this for photo tag.  Thank you Baby Kato for a great recipe!  (It made a great night time snack for my husband last night!"
204705,157068,2008-11-09,5,"I forgot to add the lime zest, but this was still really good. We used it to make our own copy cat Chipotle burrito bowls."
533300,41671,2008-10-20,5,"The best chocolate pudding I have ever eaten!  Thick, creamy, intense chocolate flavor.  Very easy to make and forgiving with substitute ingredients and preparation.  I accidently added all the ingredients  (except vanilla) to the pan, so  I went ahead and cooked the mixture.  Rather than whole milk I used 3/4 Cup 1% milk and 1/4 C heavy cream and substituted 1/2 oz unsweetened chocolate and 1 tbs sugar for the bittersweet/semisweet chocolate.  Thanks, Bev!"
1384072,217989,2009-09-14,5,I loved it! I also added 1 Tablespoon of vanilla extract.
74281,68118,2007-09-02,5,"I made this for a friend and made an extra jar for our house as well. I made it even easier by using canned jalapenos. For my twin granddaughter's 1st birthday today I served it over a block of cream cheese with wheat thins on the side and everyone declare it ""delicious""! I agree....easy and delicious are both high on my list too! I used a 4-oz can of chopped jalapenos, rinsed and chopped even more, with two 18 oz jars of apple jelly. For me, it was not hot enough, my mistake though. Next time I'll use a can for each jar. I LOVE this recipe and plan on adding jars of this to my holiday baskets."
128473,472170,2013-04-13,5,"What a delicious way to serve shrimp.  I used jumbo shrimps in this dish and am really happy that I did.  What a taste treat, great flavor and textures.  We really enjoyed the shrimps prepared this way, they were hot and spicy but not overly, you could still taste the sweet shrimp.  Served with recipe #493322 for a very special meal.  I will definitely be preparing these quick and easy to make shrimp again, thanks so much for sharing your treasure.  Made for Pac Spring Safari 2013."
766490,83203,2013-05-09,5,"I&#039;m making this right now.  Followed the recipe to a T except that I did use heaping measurements.  Tasted wonderful before adding to the chicken.  It is all siting in a gallon zip lock bag &quot;melding&quot;!  This is going to be so good!  The liquid measurements were spot on but the garlic and onion and pepper/ginger where all a little over per the recipe.  Can&#039;t wait to see the final result.  I&#039;ll let y&#039;all know how it turns out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back!  This was very tasty, I didn&#039;t find the sesame oil overpowering at all.  The recipe is spot on IMHO."
399576,190410,2007-07-11,4,"We liked this. I'm always looking for new ways to prepare fish, and DH loves olives. Very nice mediterrean flavor."
507233,152441,2007-06-01,5,Best carrots I have EVER had.  PERIOD!
28995,9114,2002-06-27,5,Turned out great- might have cooked it too long - but still came out yummy!  The creamy sauce is perfect!  The potatoes and the ham made a wonderful meal!  Thanks!
176615,163739,2007-11-04,5,Wonderful and a much healthier alternative. I usually avoid recipes with Bisquick and now I don't have to! Scaled the recipe down to 2 3/4 cups and used butter for shortening in recipe #200705. Will use this again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!
481092,95376,2009-02-24,5,5+ stars.  This has made it into my best of 2009 cookbook.  The lemon rind with heat and sweet truly makes this fish spectacular.  The fish was PERFECTLY moist baked as directed and the brown sugar made a splendid glazed crust.  Served with Recipe #318746 since they had similarities.
383346,229506,2012-01-09,5,Great pancakes.  I added more milk to have the right consistency.  The taste was very good.  Thanks Molly :)  Made for Bargain Basement tag game
1326313,137370,2010-04-19,5,"I was looking around Youtube and came across a Korean Banana Milk commercial. I looked up ""Banana Milk"" and this page came up so I decided to try it and I LOVED it. This along with frozen banana ice cream is my current favorite snack. :) If you love bananas, you'll love banana milk."
446143,102422,2007-03-19,4,"Good recipe!  I marinated all day, and baked at 375 for about 25 minutes.  This was a nice change from the basic lemon fish we always do.  Next time I'll probably add more cayenne and less black pepper.  Thanks!"
764068,45354,2010-04-06,5,"Wow! Like many other I was skeptical about the recipe being bland. What a wonderful easy recipe. I did a bit of salt to the pork chops and when I added the onions and garlic to the pan; I browned them a bit and then added a few tablespoons of flour before I added the water. Covered and let this simmer for about 20 minutes; then added about 1/2 teaspoon of Kitchen Bouquet to the Onion Gravy. Delicious!!! Served with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Broccoli.
Thanks for posting!!!!"
447165,121875,2008-09-04,5,"I used a sugar cookie dough for the crust (saw it used in a similar recipe, but liked the look of your filling recipe better).  Did everything else as you have written, then drizzled melted chocolate (thinned with a little shortening) over the top of the whole thing.  It got lots of oohs and ahhs at dessert time.  Thanks!"
61660,186849,2007-06-14,5,"Oh Wow!!!!!  I was craving something sweet, and this was just deliciously perfect!  I've got a new snack!!  You must try this!!"
133174,132764,2007-05-25,5,This is a quick and delicious salad.  It was easily made with things I had on hand.  The dressing is light and makes for a pleasing flavor combination.  This recipe is easily scaled to smaller servings.  Made for ZWTIII.
88099,331991,2008-11-21,5,"OMG Lainey, you have really produced a winner in this Mac and Cheese.  As you mentioned you do have to ignore conventional wisdom about cooking pasta, but I followed this recipe to the T, with the exception of making half of it.  The end result was a beautiful creamy dish with a wonderful flavor of the three cheeses and the addition of a crunchy top.  Warning, as with all broiling, watch closely that last minute.  I had a couple of places get a little toasted, but no matter, it was good anyway.  I broiled mine on low broil for 7 minutes, should have been 6 for my oven.  Thanks Lainey.  Made for PRMR"
58104,147596,2006-01-03,4,"This is so different then any drink I`m used to. I used pandan essence which is almond or hazelnut in scent and taste. Very nice. I do wish this recipe was more accurate with amounts of lime juice & water. Also the amount for water is missing for the syrup. It was guess work for me. I must say I do make a big many of foods from all over the world BUT I don`t know many things. Like as in this recipe it is a first to make anything with pandan and I did enjoy it. The leaves are not available here but the essence is. A good substitute would be almond or hazelnut extract.
This reminds me of Bubble Tea in texture. Drinking with pieces of jello. Be sure to finely grate the agar agar mixture or it will end up sitting on the bottom of the glass. "
311003,315107,2008-08-28,4,I made this ice cream using fresh peaches and it came out wonderfully.  I put the ice cream in the freezer overnight and it came out with a smooth and creamy consistency.  The only change I'll make next time is to use only half of the brown sugar because I think that will bring out the flavor of the peaches even more.  Thanks for posting this delicious and low-cholesterol recipe!
280271,350722,2009-08-26,5,"OK, OK, I know it says chocolate chip but I had some white chocolate, some semisweet chocolate and a few more butterscotch chips leftover begging me to do something with them. So I tagged this because they all totaled (6 oz). Oh! these are so yummy, they melt in your mouth. My DD has an awesome recipe (which she won't share) this is so close to hers. I cut the recipe in half and froze the other 1/2 of the dough because I didn't want to make a pig of myself. Thanks for posting. :)"
347873,94532,2013-03-27,5,"I baked this in an 8 inch square pan at 375 F. for 25 min - it looked done but there were actually large pockets of batter that was still semi-raw. Part of it, however, did bake fully. Maybe it&#039;s the fault of the oven - next time I will test it for doneness in several places or make muffins.  BUT ... the flavor was AWESOME and the texture of the baked part was pretty awesome too.  So it still gets 5 stars from me!  Thanks for posting!"
183524,117061,2009-06-06,5,I made this for lunch for my work crew of 6 men and one woman. There were no leftovers.  I substituted swiss cheese for the mozarella and used a poblano pepper.  I had quite a bit of dressing left after smearing it on the bread so I dribbled it over both layers of lettuce. I also used less than the full 1/2 pound of capicola because it was sliced so thinly.  I guess next time I will make two layer of it.
472042,79766,2008-08-05,5,"This was a smashing hit at my last gathering.  Everyone loved it and it was gone in no time.  Easy to make and store in the fridge before hand, so then you just snap it in the oven and then ready to serve.  I didn't change a thing, and it was absolutely perfectly perfect!!!  Give it a try!!!!"
250920,35185,2005-12-16,5,This is just like my recipe exactly except I double it and often serve it with scones (a recipe I hope to add eventually).  When doubling I use half of the can of frozen orange concentrate and somewhere between 1/4-1/2 cup of sugar.  Simply delicious!
674022,385221,2009-09-23,5,Good meal for a cool night. Here is CA it is warm out but it is still a nice to have a warm meal. DH enjoyed this & said it was flavorful. We couldn't find new potatoes at the two stores in our area so we used baby dutch yellow potatoes. They were terrific and tiny so no need to cut up.  Otherwise it was as written. The slow cooker I used has bottom and side elements and it cooked for  8 hours but wasn't completely tender. I think different slow cookers cook differently so watch it as it gets to the end. Thanks for sharing Sarabeth. Enjoy. ChefDLH
306897,108105,2011-10-15,4,This was okay. I just think there is too much vinegar in the sauce; two hours later I could still feel the taste of vinegar in my mouth (and that after dessert too).
628779,25885,2007-11-18,5,"I know you dont need anymore stars, but, this was awsome. My husband and I ate half of it already and its only been out of the oven an hour."
214633,107868,2005-05-09,5,"this is the best bread ever!! nice and light compared to the others i have tried. you won't regret it if you try it. i have also tried it with half whole wheat and it was great:)
now if i could only find a great banana bread recipe i'll be set!"
17222,8661,2001-10-15,4,Great to find a real French recipe for salad dressing have been looking for one for years after living in France
29014,80413,2009-07-16,5,"As my husband said ""don't do anything different""!  All I did do differently is to use plain old AP flour because that's what I had on hand.  This recipe is a life-saver.  We were so sick and tired of the store-bought buns.  First of all, they aren't even any good around here, and second ~ too many in a package for just the two of us.  These buns freeze well (unlike store-bought) so we can just fill up a big freezer bag and take out what we need.  Next time, I am going to make half hamburger shaped and half for hot dogs or sausages.  These are SO good.  Thank you so much for posting, Marie!!"
494867,97425,2008-12-17,5,"Yum!  This is a great recipe for a kinda healthy muffin! I used Total cereal, I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup (because I like sweet muffins), and needed 2 extra tablespoons of soymilk. But otherwise I followed the recipe.  I have to say the batter didn't look all that good with soggy cereal in it, but the final result was terrific!  It filled 12 muffin cups almost full up.  But the muffins didn't rise that much.  Topping was great too.  Will be making these again."
67728,391327,2014-05-05,0,"I&#039;m sorry, I was really disappointed by these. I was really hoping for something more like regular chewy oatmeal cookies, but these were basically like little mounds of banana bread. I like banana bread, but I&#039;m just not a fan of cakey cookies. I&#039;m sure that anyone who likes cakey cookies and tries these will love them, because they do taste good, but the texture just put me off. I&#039;m not assigning any stars to this because I don&#039;t want to make people think this is a bad recipe with a low rating -- it&#039;s really not. It&#039;s just that it doesn&#039;t suit my personal tastes. Sorry again! Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
1733645,339322,2010-11-17,4,Thank you i have been looking for this recipe forever My family will enjoy
226863,339284,2010-09-20,5,"I'm on a diet, and looking for recipes I can make and still fit into my diet.....so I used ground sirloin instead of ground beef to cut fat and calorie count.  I was so pleasantly surprised by this recipe....It was delicious!  I was able to eat a bowl full of this and still stay within my boundaries!!!! Thanks so much for a delicious, filling recipe.  Made for Holiday Tag."
497077,146029,2008-06-05,5,"DH and I loved this dressing! Haven't had green goddess since my college dorm days-takes me back a few years!!!  Made exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  Thank you, Uncle Bill, for a great recipe!!!"
1794395,73166,2011-01-14,1,"Just finished eating this for supper.  Not even close to the best chili I've ever tasted.  My DH only ate 4 or 5 bites.  The flavor is initially good (we like the spice combination), but it finishes on a bitter note that neither of us found very palatable.  Will try to make again some day with out the beer and coffee.  We are very disappointed that we didn't like this as much as everyone else does."
103380,66103,2004-06-27,5,"My family loves this recipe. I have made it 5 times already. I prepared recipe as stated and took MRSEL's advice and doubled sauce. Outstanding! The saltiness of the capers and browned butter almonds adds so much to this dish
"
894563,35328,2011-02-23,3,"Not sure if the ""dough"" was supposed to be crumbly as it was or if it was supposed to be more dough like. I found that when I had olive juice on my hands they formed dough better and it was easier to get around the olive (btw I used queen sized olives in pics). I expected them to taste better. They were interesting. But I wouldn't make them too often."
226863,27652,2011-02-13,5,"Delicious!  The cooking time is perfect.  My chicken came out with perfect grill marks, but very moist and tasty.  Don't know why this marinade permeated the chicken so well.....maybe because it sat at room temp, which is something I've always been told not to do with chicken.  If I'm sick tomorrow....I'll be back to rewrite the review!  For now....I have to say 5  stars!!!"
1880048,32204,2016-05-26,5,I have been making this recipe for years just as written. It gets rave reviews from everyone every time. Wonderful rich chocolate flavor and very versatile. I love how you can add additions and change it up as you wish.
422893,254289,2008-05-21,5,"Both DH & I really enjoyed this one, mu mushrooms looked a little worse for wear so I used canned ones but otherwise made as directed, loved the creamy sauce & I'm sure we'll make this again, thanks for posting!"
57042,31607,2010-01-31,3,I gave this recipe 3 stars. My family liked these but weren't crazy over how hard they turned out. These rolls were pretty tasty though. They reminded of cinnamon rolls I used to make as a tennager. They only changes I made to the recipe was I added a scoop of protein powder (may be why they got hard) and as for the filling I used Splenda as it taste good with cinnamon. The rest of the recipe I followed as directed. Overall I'd make these again they would be great with coffee. Thanks for posting a good recipe! Christine (internetnut)
386849,77300,2008-09-05,3,A nice tasting bread.  My husband is Finnish and so we enjoyed the cardamom. Thanks!
124196,92072,2005-02-24,4,This was good.  I really liked it because it was easy to put together.  It was nice because I didn't have to brown the chicken rolls in a fry pan first.  The chicken came out very juicy.  This would be nice to make for company because you could put it together earlier in the day and just bake it off when you need it.
507500,102234,2007-05-28,4,Now thats the way to eat a taco
110210,77087,2006-04-08,5,Whipped up a batch of this to go with our dinner tonight and it's so good!! I used 4 LARGE garlic cloves since I figured the flavor would be stronger in a few hours at dinner time. I think the red pepper flakes (I used the full amount) is a nice spicy touch and love it. This is a great way to make hummus. Thanks so much!!! 
496829,169739,2008-06-05,5,Simple and delicious!  I have also made this using pears and other nuts like walnuts and pecans.  A definite keeper.
2001435840,355428,2017-03-14,5,Loved it so much that I'm making it again tonight! Grateful for the specific note that advised us to heat up the pan and sear.
452940,283040,2009-01-13,5,"This recipe made it into our Book #231450. 4/4/08 - Double Kudos! An absolutely marvelous artichoke recipe. The lemon flavor is abundant yet not overpowering. The same for the 'drukeness' (or alcohol). Very smooth. We did substitute white rum for the brandy, but otherwise made to specs. Maito, you've done it again. Thanks so much for posting."
434314,22612,2007-01-20,5,"Our new New Year's favorite.  Our son dipped large marshmallows in the fondue then rolled them in graham cracker crumbs for a ""smore"" treat."
240552,198488,2007-05-15,5,Definitely yummy!  I used 1/2 butter and half butter flavored crisco. I also added more eggs (2) because of the consistency.  Thank you for posting this and thank you for being such a blessing to us all on Zaar!
1582575,96886,2011-04-26,5,This recipe was amazing!!!!  I used cheddar cheese and used the mozzarella on top.  EVERYONE loved this! It was soooooo good!  I will definitely be making this again!
1718673,189441,2010-11-01,5,Absolutely Heavenly!  Sour Cream added a nice touch.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!
8688,163971,2007-12-07,5,"Mmmmm!!  Yummy! These flavors are an excellent combination! Thanks once again, Mama's Kitchen!"
537937,204045,2009-04-28,4,"These are a nice little muffin w/relatively little work in putting together.  I chose to use 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup all-purpose.  Also, used Splenda sugar in place of regular.  I used Smucker's Low-Sugar Apricot Preserves for my jam of choice using 1 heaping teaspoon in each.  A virtually guilt-free muffin:-)
Made for 123Hits~"
439174,105874,2011-01-12,5,"This recipe has turned out to be a family favorite.  I pretty much use as listed in the ingredients for the recipe, but have made changes if I didn't have the right ingredients on hand.  It has always turned out great.  Thank you!"
451700,276155,2008-04-02,5,"Wonderful soup! And keeps up to the name: TLC! DH was down with a throat infection and fever and he is NOT a soup person but he was very grateful this soup came to his rescue! Ohh I wasn't too sure what chicken base was so used chicken bouillon cubes instead and added in fresh mushrooms. And I cooked the veggies a bit longer so DH would find it easier to swallow but other than that did not change a thing. Even my fussy DD enjoyed it! Thank you, Wildflour, for sharing your wonderful recipe! Definitely will be making it again... and hopefully nobody will be ill then to enjoy it better!"
496803,381296,2011-06-18,4,"This is such a pretty dish!  The red of the peppers, orange of the mango, bright green of the onions and lettuce, and tan of the chicken combine to make a gorgeous meal for the eyes, even before you dig in.  The chopped nuts add a textural element  that makes this dish shine.A real key to this dish is the dressing, so make sure you choose one that you love.  This was the perfect size for a light lunch, with a cool glass of rose wine on the side.  Instead of making wraps, which I find messy to eat, I made a salad out of this, serving on top of the lettuce instead of wrapped in it.  While eating, we thought of a couple variations we'd like to try (not better, just different)- basil dressing instead of cilantro; pineapple instead of (or along with) the mango.  I did make one significant change- I served this at room temp rather than chilled.  I felt that serving chilled would mute some of the flavors; and since it's a cold, rainy day, a chilled salad just didn't sound as appealing as it would on a hot summer day.  Made for ZWT7- Emerald City Shakers"
232480,75316,2006-02-26,5,"Excellent.  I followed all the ingredients in the recipe exactly, but I didn't use the skewers.  I just browned the pork (boneless pork chops) in cubes in the pan before adding the broth and water.  The recipe doesn't specify when to add the soup mix, but I can't think of anyplace to add it other than after browning the pork along with the broth and water.  I thickened the juices with a little cornstarch and water and had a lovely gravy to serve over roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  Some homemade applesauce on the side and this was a perfect meal.  Thank you!"
102058,205883,2007-07-07,4,"I made this for DH and it met with an ok response. I used piri piri in the absence of chili flakes and that did pack a punch so he wasn't complaining there, he just said that other recipes I have tried tasted even better, so I think that it's a case of we are spoiled by Zaar and getting rather choosey.  The good news it that DH said he wouldn't mind to have this again. And from the Pasta Fanatic that's not bad going. Please see my rating system: This one gets a lovely 4 stars. Thanks!"
1972415,28011,2011-07-31,5,"So simple, such amazing results! I decided, based on the outstanding reviews, to quintuple the recipe right out of the gate. Tried it tonight for the first time and we were blown away by the savory goodness of this mix. I used white wine and freshly squeezed lime juice for my liquid. I used 1 lb. of chicken breasts cut into strips, green and red peppers and onions. We truly felt we had restaurant quality fajitas ~ major yum factor!"
387942,157194,2008-12-07,5,This is YUM-O. I also had trouble getting it to thicken but it still tasted great. Made it for a pasta night I went to recently and everyone loved it.
111075,72867,2007-10-25,5,"We loved this recipe.  Simple, good food that was part of a gourmet experience.  I chose to use sweet potato, carrot and parsnip for this recipe and served it as an accompaniment to Recipe #62908.  This was an excellent match and made a memorable birthday dinner main course.  Thanks for sharing this lovely recipe."
2001591758,84516,2017-06-19,5,"This is my favorite low carb recipe by far! I will never miss eating regular pizza again. I have tried alot of keto recipes since I am a diabetic and always looking for low carb recipes. Most of them just do not taste that good to me. But this one is awesome! To the guy that asked &quot;where is the crust?&quot; It's the part that you baked for 10 min before you put the sauce on. If you let it cook long enough so the edges get a little dark, it is kinda like having a crust along the edge."
2324285,56818,2012-09-17,3,The acidity of the tomatoes mixed with the other ingredients didn't work for me :/
1354238,205610,2011-09-22,5,"This was exactly what I was looking for.  I used whole organic milk for a creamier taste and it turned out fine, the one recommendation I would make is to cut the sugar in half, it was much too sweet for my tastes.  Follow the recipe and you can't go wrong!"
332905,344449,2009-05-30,5,"This is a great recipe.  You can also use 1 cup of Guinness (or another stout) instead of the wine and skip the ""reduce by half"" step in Step 3.  Add 1/2 cup of chopped prunes at the same time.  Delicious."
125411,36510,2006-06-01,5,"This was delicious. We thought the flavors were wonderful together, and I'm going to try it with chicken breasts next time. Thank you for posting."
68460,61210,2005-03-28,5,"Delicious!  I made just one of these....just for me!  I let the choke saute for about 5 minutes, then added the garlic and sauteed for 5 more minutes before adding the water and chicken broth.  Cooked (steamed) for 15 minutes and it was just right...I had a medium-sized artichoke.  Very good, though I did add a little salt at the table but, I'm 'salt girl' so that's not unusual.  I'll make this again, I really loved it...thanks Chippie :)"
2001310112,271023,2016-12-21,5,Excellent recipe. ..no tweaks required. My 9 &amp; 11 year Olds made thsee without me....they are excellent
1183908,186566,2011-02-25,5,"What a nice, refreshing treat!  Thank you for a yummy recipe!"
210117,357881,2010-02-11,5,"Wow what a great version of an old classic!!!  I actually had a 5 oz jar of the beef so I added it for an extra ""beefy"" version.  We had it over biscuits and all loved the mushroom soup instead of gravy. Thanks for sharing!"
185146,67256,2005-02-04,5,"I made this cake for the first time and I also added a 1/2 cup more bananas as I would have had to throw them out,I cut the icing recipe in half which you suggested it was just enough and topped the cake with chopped pecans.  You were right about the freezer part, I don't know what it does but the cake turned out to be DELICIOUS "
593726,140307,2008-03-02,3,"These were OK, the wontons were kind of hard and dry.  I used lean ground sirloin and a low fat mexican cheese blend.  I did add more cheese than called for and it still seemed like the meat mixture was missing something."
840768,47549,2011-05-01,5,"Very tasty recipe.  You could even call it Greek Salad dip cause, except for the cottage cheese, it has all the same ingredients I put in my 'favorite' Greek Salad.  Perfect proportions of ingredients, only I made the mistake of adding an extra garlic (as I always do) & I found it abit too much so next time I'll stick to the recipe. I used 2 vs 3 Tbsp olive oil & didn't bother 'skinning' my tomatoes.  I added 1/4 c cream cheese & sprinkled top with chopped red peppers. Took this to a party & it was very well received, thanks for sharing."
1053861,115440,2008-12-01,5,"I used turkey from my T-day leftovers instead of chicken to make the broth and to provide the meat.  I prepared the broth according to the directions, simmering with the lemongrass, ginger, and chilies for about 30 minutes while I made brown rice.  Then, rather than cooking the veggies, I brought them to work and with a speed peeler, shaved them into the bowl with the turkey, rice, and fresh cilantro and then just poured over the top with the reheated broth.  It made an excellent ""fresh"" lunch."
56447,55056,2003-05-13,4,"This dish has a very good flavor, the bacon gives the broth that little something extra for a delicious gravy.  However, the meat was not as tender and moist as I would have liked.  This is a good recipe if you are strapped for time, but we haven't quite found that recipe to replace oven roasted beef.  :o)  Thank you for contributing this time saver.  "
672320,116536,2010-01-24,5,"Made these as a starter for a dinner party.  I made the marinade up the morning of, and added the shrimp an hour before cooking.  Instead of grilling (winter, cold, burr!), I opted to roast them in the oven.  400 for 5 minutes - perfect.  Thanks Rita - I can think of so many ways to use these spicy little guys - in a wrap, over rice, cold right out of the fridge . . ."
777321,106627,2008-09-28,5,Very tasty! It was easy to prepare and my fiance loved it.
1052873,108775,2010-12-26,5,"This was wonderful! Used the frozen salmon filet portions (thawed) from Costco, Panko, and dried parsley but otherwise followed exactly. Regular bread crumbs would probably have been better, but this is the best salmon I've had outside the roadside stands in Alaska!"
296085,137972,2011-10-13,5,It came out perfectly! My dinner guests loved it! <br/>Thanks for sharing on Food.com
76535,89908,2004-08-25,4,These went over pretty good at an office party we had this morning. Thanks!
122541,42094,2007-11-24,5,"Excellent,I did up the spices by about 25% and added 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne - but all in all just what you want in a rich enchilada sauce."
212922,106586,2006-12-20,5,These came out extremely well!  Thanks for the recipe!
377161,220325,2007-06-26,5,"Excellent. The taste was fabulous
and it went together very easily.
Can't wait to make for company!
Thanks Witch Doctor"
630047,82102,2009-01-11,4,"This recipe was incredibly easy and very yummy! The only change I made was that I had plain breadcrumbs instead of the seasoned ones that it called for. I didn't add any extra seasonings, I followed the rest of the recipe perfectly. My husband was sick of ""baked casserole"" meals so this was a nice change for us. I can't believe how easy it was. I cooked ours for 30 mins (3 large chicken breasts) added cheddar and mozzarella cheese and cooked for 5 more minutes. It was very juicy, but cooked thoroughly. Thanks for sharing this recipe! It's definitely a keeper for us!"
1017476,361064,2009-06-14,5,these are great...thanks so much for sharing...i wish everyone would try these ...
37449,250758,2009-04-02,5,This turned out yummy! I used it to make bean anc cheese enchiladas and enjoyed very much! Thanks! Made for the Australean Recipe Swap-April.
68526,192371,2008-01-30,4,"Let me first say that I loved the idea of these muffins. I had some fresh strawberries, so I cooked up the pint basket of strawberries with 6 pkts. of splenda, then added a little cornstarch in after cooked, to thicken. I let them cool while I made the filling and batter. I loved the taste of the cream cheese mixture. Went very well with the strawberry filling. The muffins were a different story. I creamed the egg, milk, brown sugar, zest and vanilla. However, when I mixed it in with the flour mixture, I used my hand mixer. BIG MISTAKE! The muffins came out flat on top, and very heavy texture. I used a 6 muffin tin, and they made huge muffins. The only thing I really noticed when I bit into them was that there was WAY too much baking powder. I wouldn't use any more than 2 tsp. next time at the most.  It's all I could taste in the batter part of the muffin. I will definately play around with this recipe, but I will also make them again and mix by hand, and see if it makes a difference. When biting into a piece with mostly cream cheese and strawberry filling it was fantastic, so I know this recipe has potential. Thanks for sharing Redsie! Made for Zaar Stars Tag Game"
217724,130015,2005-07-17,5,"I had this recipe and have made it for years, but always used butterscotch morsels instead of the m&m's. I think the butterscotch flavor enhances the golden grahams. Either way, they are good and never last long!!"
302486,416201,2012-05-24,5,"We really liked this, I did not have any Lipton onion soup mix so I used recipe #153788<br/>copycat recipe (with better than bouillon rather than powdered which gave the rice better flavor) Cooked for exactly 1 hour covered with no additional cooking for the rice. The chops were perfectly moist. Thanks for posting!"
879716,124666,2010-12-19,5,I served these to over 20 guests at my husband's birthday dinner party and people were raving about them before I even got to taste them.  Several people told me they tasted better than Red Lobster's biscuits and I must say I absolutely agree!  YUM!  Thanks for posting :)
57695,121405,2005-10-18,5,"Sooo easy! i never thought of using oreos before! I used the chocolate creme ones, to make it extra good! Thanks for an easy and good idea!"
67656,84141,2005-09-11,5,I absolutely loved these beets as they were quite different from the typical pickled beets.  I used cloves (a few more than listed and prepared horse radish).  Gave the salad a nice bit of spiciness that was neither hot nor sour -- just a little tart and tangy.  Found it to be a refreshing change from so many beet salads which are just too sweet and a little flat on flavor.  
930286,14016,2009-02-05,4,"I can't help but giggle at the opinions on this page, seems you've angered alot of vegetarians. I happen to think this is delightful, the title made me giggle a bit, though. Anyway, getting over the fact of eating cute sweet creatures... Like no one hasn't eaten a burger before.. This is a good recipe for anyone who wants to get a little exotic... lets see what happens when someone puts up a kangaroo recipe."
362565,358553,2009-03-02,5,"I make a similar version but had to guess for the recipe and I think your recipe is the real deal.  These are awesome!  Made them for a baby shower and they were a huge hit, a friend went home and made them for her Thanksgiving dinner she loved them soo much.  Thanks for sharing!"
41799,2066,2003-10-28,4,"First time I ever tried ramen noodles.  Guess I am behind the times or deprived, LOL.  This was very tasty.  Next time I make it I want to serve it with salsa and sour cream.  I think it would be very yummy that way.  Thanks for sharing Steve.  Tweeky."
49312,17601,2002-09-23,5,"Wonderful!  So easy and quick to prepare and so delicious.  I only made slight alterations.  First I soaked the calves liver in milk - why - because my Mother said so - she's almost 90 and I'm not about to argue.  I then followed your recipe.  Besides the onions I added bacon like it has come served in some restaurants when I've ordered it out.  I served it with creamed spinach and baked potatoes with butter, sour cream, bacon bits, and a little shredded cheese. I think calves liver gets a bum rap probably because the name prohibits people from trying it. It's great folks - give it a chance. Thanks for the recipe, now I can make it at home."
171303,116899,2007-01-03,3,"I had this recipe in my cookbook for a while and was really looking forward to making it. I really struggled with how to rate this recipe & I guess I should start by saying that due to diet limitations, I did use fat free versions of the dressing, milk and cheese and egg substitute with good success, but was disappointed in the overall flavor of the dish and felt that it needed some sort of herb or spice to jazz it up.  Next time I think I would either add some rosemary and garlic to the egg mixture, or maybe feta, garlic and dill to give it more flavor.  On the plus side, this dish is visually beautiful and as other reviewers mentioned, the crust portion has the potential to be very versitile.  Thank you Lauralie41 for sharing the recipe."
703869,310418,2009-10-20,5,These cookies were good. Mine turned out on the flat side. But I forgot to add the right amount of baking soda. I will try these again.
403729,257276,2012-02-24,5,"I have a new slow cooker mac and cheese now! I used 1% milk, light sour cream, 2 cups extra sharp cheddar and a 4 oz chunk of 2% Velveta and it was nice and creamy.  Also skipped the eggs. Followed the technique, but love the idea of melting the cheese and butter in the crockpot then mixing in everything else.  Made a good sized batch, had dinner tonight for 3 of us, enough for at least lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for posting, a keeper for sure."
923687,9782,2008-08-24,5,"Wonderful recipe! Only suggestion would be that it needs a little extra salt. Other than that, it's delicious and VERY similar to Olive Garden's. Thanks!"
154026,98526,2006-04-17,5,"Made this for our Easter family dinner..we can't get CoolWhip here so i substituted 1 c of plain yoghurt.  Easy to make, looked great and was delicious.  Thankyou for sharing."
286209,61789,2007-05-14,4,"Love this recipe, I made it with shrimp instead of chicken, delicious!!!!"
376098,57772,2008-10-18,4,"We enjoyed this.  For some reason ours ended up a bit on the salty side, so next time I need to use lower-salt taco seasoning or check the sauce and make sure it's low salt.  Other than that, we thought this was great, and we have the other half in the freezer waiting for a busy day.  Thanks for the recipe!"
2189849,495152,2013-02-11,5,Did someone say pizza with Hidden Valley? I'm so there!
191050,25631,2005-04-02,3,"I only gave this 3 stars because the marinade smelled amazing and probably would have been really great alone, but the sauce was not good at all.  It had an extremely overpowering ketchup taste because of the Heinz chili sauce and ketchup.  It just tasted like I slapped some ketchup on some pork chops after baking them. I will try the marinade again, though, and just skip the sauce.  Sorry."
302795,193979,2007-02-18,5,"This was a really good recipe, easy to make and it tasted excellent!  Thanks!"

386585,106435,2012-12-10,5,"I absolutely love this way of dressing up plain water, and adding an extra elegance to the dinner table!  The flavor is wonderful!  Thanks for sharing."
21752,56218,2003-03-16,5,"We are big cottage (or shepherd's) pie fans in our house.  When I saw this recipe I couldn't wait to try it, I never thought of adding a layer of corn between the meat and the potatoes.  I also loved the mashed potatoes mixed with the fried onions, I had the BH and the kids fighting over the crust.  Instead of using garlic and onion powder I used fresh garlic and lots of paprika.  There's just enough pie left over for dinner tonight, I hid it all the way back in the fridge so the BH doesn't find it first!  Thanks, Aviva, I really enjoyed this dish!"
57042,85148,2009-06-02,5,"I gave this recipe 5 stars. My family loved these biscuits they are so buttery, moist, flaky and fluffy! I love the fact they used sour cream as that's a bump in protein for me. When I made these biscuits I thought they looked and felt a bit to loose so I added a bit more bisquick until I felt these would hold their shape. I had to bake them 20 minutes and they turned out great! Overall these are so good and I'll will for sure make these again! Thanks for posting! Christine (internetnut)"
858069,172455,2008-10-28,5,Fabulous recipe!  I'm not a big pinto beans fan - but these taste absolutely fabulous!  I will definitely be making these frequently!
1728937,33921,2010-11-14,0,"As with all recipes, I did make some amendments according to personal taste.  I used cooked brown rice instead of the oats and added about 5 finely chopped cremini mushrooms.  I also added garlic to the cooking lentils (green) and blended in food processor with a little extra water.  I also used 2 eggs and a little extra tomato sauce (homemade of course!).  Cooked in mini loaves and was super delish!  Served with mashed potatoes and a drizzle of extra tomato sauce on top.  My hubby (who was skeptical when I told him what I was making) has already had 2 servings :-)"
47559,135664,2005-09-28,5,"I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, placed them in the marinade frozen, before work, and they were thawed by dinner time.  I used the panini grill to cook them in 4 minutes.  They were juicy, very well seasoned, and a nice bronze color.  Perfect recipe for a quick week night meal."
428885,280795,2011-04-03,5,"Bring the kids, and tell em' don't be late! You might not get any of this delish chicken dinner.....and you'd better eat fast, before the last chicken leg is gone. Wow! Absolutely outstanding. I let ""her"" sit in a dutch oven on the back of the stove, slightly bubbling, (very slight) instead of crock pot....and made my own mushroom soup with fresh garlic cloves (2 large) but other then that....followed this exactly. What a winner, you have here! Loved it! Made for Aussie Swap April 2011"
1331733,345614,2017-08-31,5,"this recipe is so easy and delicious served it with lime cilantro rice. was even better the 2nd day, if I had to tweak it I would make it 1 day in advance."
302283,125034,2011-01-19,5,"Kittencal, you are consistently my favorite cook on Food.com - thanks for this!  We used some leftover artisan loaves and they are extraordinary!"
169430,270583,2012-01-20,5,"Step aside or get pushed out of the way when the family or group spot these. So easy and a sure fire winner. I used 60% dark chocolate, very rough chopped salted cashews (no peanuts on hand) and Lindt white chocolate. They looked amazing too, I added the nuts to the chocolate first to get them all covered and then added the white chocolate and mixed just enough to get marbled nut candies. This simple recipe is an all time keeper."
2000609047,54393,2015-10-26,5,"I&#039;m giving it 5 stars because of what I added to it. I sauteed a medium onion and 3 celery ribs (both finely diced) and garlic, and doubled the recipe. Added a few preferred seasonings, such as a tsp of Cajun seasoning, and a tsp of McCormick&#039;s Perfect Pinch and it was amazing. Some complained in the reviews that it was bland which is why I did this. Will be making this again and again. Even my mother, who is sensitive to anything like Cajun seasoning, loved it."
280271,311567,2008-11-22,3,"Both DH and I thought the flavor was OK, but nothing to jump up and down about. The meat did come out very moist and tender. I used pheasant instead of chicken and the juice kept it from drying out. I used a very good tomato juice from Trader Joes. This had a stew like flavor for us with out spices. I wasn't sure when to add the onion flakes so I threw them in during step #4. We really didn't taste the tarragon very much. Not sure what the amount was suppose to be in step 3 because I used the full teaspoon for the rub so I just sprinkled a bit more on the meat. I served it over noodles. Thanks for letting me try your recipe. :)"
1536449,326810,2010-02-21,5,I saw this recipe in the Kraft Foods magazine and I LOVE it. I made the American style with the barbecue sauce however I made a regular meatloaf. I did not make mini meatloaves. The Stove Top gives it such good flavor. I have made this several times and will continue to make it.
469903,228390,2007-09-29,5,"I have made this dish several times this fall and absolutely LOVE it!  The first time I used about 3/4 pound ground turkey sausage and the second time I used 1/2 pound ground bison.  I found that using a medium spaghetti squash was too much, so I bought the smallest one I could find and it was still too much - I just put the leftovers in a container for later.  After making the first time, I decided to drain the tomatoes because it was too runny and the pie plate became overfull.  This recipes makes a huge amount!  My DH and DS both love it!"
59064,64699,2003-07-05,4,"I really enjoyed the pesto in this recipe. I used fresh basil and spearmint and these combined well.
It went well with the tomatoes but not quite so well with the asparagus, overwhelming the taste of the asparagus a little. Despite this, it is still an enjoyable dish and it certainly looks pretty on the plate. Very quick and easy to make as well, so it would be worth doing at a BBQ."
348530,166466,2006-10-08,4,"OK, I totally botched this recipe but I still loved it! I used whole wheat pastry flour (in a word: don't! It got pretty gloppy.) Also, I was greedy and tried to do too many potatoes at once in the pan. I think I should have cooked the potatoes in batches so each 'layer' could brown well (my pan is too small.) Other than that it was yummy! Thanks, I will make it again. (As a side note: I used red bell pepper; I think a mix of different-colored peppers would be pretty in this recipe.)"
27783,26249,2003-11-13,5,"I followed the directions exactly and found them to be highly accurate.  My chicken came out perfectly crispy on the outside with a nice, flavorful sauce.  Next time I would like to try skinning the chicken to see if it is just as good that way, so I can reduce the fat.  But as it stands, this is a great, easy recipe for any night of the week.  Thanks a bunch!"
234182,94963,2005-08-26,5,hey i made this today and added 1 cup of finly chopped/crushed walnuts and boy it was great went well with the pork tenderloin and bbq chicken we had....
328154,54257,2010-03-05,5,"My boyfriend who doesn't like meatloaf LOVES it when I make this. Well, I don't make it quite the same but its close. I add a can of sweet corn to it (I like corn in my meatloaf), also I use both ground beef AND ground pork. I typically will do 1 lb beef and 1/2 lb pork. I've also used Venison and that is even better. I do add an extra egg since using the meat combos tends to make it fall apart. The sauce is great and I ALWAYS make extra."
583193,176926,2014-01-19,5,This is very good.  I loved the addition of the oats as it makes it crunchy.  Perfect with the cinnamon ice cream I had.
377712,35932,2008-01-15,5,"Yummy!  The kids love the carbonation this brings to lemonade.  I followed the advice to microwave the lemons and, yes, the sugar dissolves quickly in the warm juice.  Great suggestion. When the kids want ""soda"", I would much rather they have straight sugar than the corn syrups/asparatame/etc. in regular sodas."
2001839561,491807,2017-12-05,5,I'm confused by the poster below. This is exactly the recipe on Stephanie Izard's website. Was this recipe edited or something?

268179,129926,2006-10-05,5,I have made these several times now. great recipe and one of my husbands favorite dishes. Thanks for sharing it with us!
92385,67329,2005-06-02,4,"Very subtle lemon flavor; I think by preparing the lemon/garlic oil in advance and allowing it to infuse a bit you would achieve more of it. That being said, we enjoyed this dish. Thanks for posting!"
115525,118641,2005-12-24,5,"These are extremely good!  I've tried other no bake orange balls, but they were overly sweet, but not these.  And SO easy!  The flavor of the liqueur can sometimes be overwhelming, but these were just right - I used Grand Marnier.  Thanks!  I'll be making these again!"
50472,77001,2003-12-19,5,"Oh, I have eaten way too many of these!  They are addictive!  It was super simple to make.  The nuts turn out very glossy and shiny.  They look beautiful in a glass jar.  I must give these away before I eat them all!   "
206747,372941,2013-07-01,5,"*Made for Australia/NZ Swap #77*  Prepared about 1/2 volume this tasty recipe -- minus the okra -- STRONG personal preference.This was so quick and easy, that being so flavorful was almost a surprise !  This will be replacing my standard creole recipe.  Wish I had made the entire recipe to have left-overs !  Thanks for another winner, paula !"
492434,235943,2008-03-25,4,"This was pretty good!  I made a couple changes though..  I didn't have any pepper flakes, but I did have a hot chili sauce, so I doused the beans and tofu with it, and also added about a tablespoon to the peanut sauce, and used rice wine vinegar in it as well.  It still wasn't very spicy, so next time I make this, I'm going to use a ton of the chili sauce to give it a good kick and balance out the sweetness, and also leave out the sugar.  The peanut butter and toasted peanuts were sweet enough.  Good recipe!"
723186,29884,2010-11-20,4,"The only changes I made were using flour tortillas and omitting the olives. Also, we did not fry the tortillas at all. The dish turned out great! Will make this again for sure."
929091,97498,2011-09-06,5,"Love this recipe. The flavor is great and the heat isn't too much, but I like it super spicy so next time I will add another jalapeÃ±o or two! The consistency is a bit runny so next time I will use half the broth but I thickened with cornstarch and that helped. Will definitely make again. I also purred some of the peppers to give it a smooth consistency and added potatoes the last 20 min."
141610,14613,2007-09-13,5,Wonderful recipe.  I left out the 1/2 cup of sugar and added a minced apple in it's place.  Worked well.  I did use the topping so it wasn't totally sugar free. Oh and I didn't have farmer cheese so I just ditched it. I also used VCO coconut oil in the topping.  Saved me a step. 
341513,83409,2006-11-05,5,Go ahead and go for the 2T of umeboshi paste and maybe 3 large plums if you like the taste of umeboshi like I do. Otherwise it's a bit mild... which is perfect for people first trying it :) Good balance of everything else. Thanks for the recipe!
32143,116152,2008-03-04,5,"Really yummy! My daughter and I made 6, 3 dropped in and 3 scrambled, great both ways! Sprinkled with shredded  mozzarella/ cheddar mix. Thank-you!"
2002287422,39087,2018-09-29,0,so good ohhh yummy!
293110,108059,2007-08-15,5,had a craving for some white cake - found this recipe and had everything in the house for it.  AMAZING.  Fulfilled my craving and more.  Will definitely make again.
83093,168780,2006-06-08,5,"You came to my rescue with this recipe!  I've looked everywhere near me for Greek yoghurt to no avail.  My search is over now!  I used this recipe to prepare another of yours, Greek Yoghurt and Fruit Salad Recipe #166623.  Even though I cut it short on time (6 hours) it was still wonderful.  Thanks so much!

1110411,9492,2009-02-01,0,"My whole family loved it. I cringe at the fat content, but what the heck."
2002039534,191473,2018-03-14,5,Sounds Great! I'm allergic to whole wheat flour. What can I substitute in this and possibly many recipes?
229940,71497,2005-07-19,5,I used to work at a resturant that had a similiar form of this recipe .just about prepared the same way.It was my favorite way to cook chicken but now i have a new favorite. 
346860,68063,2009-04-02,4,"The flavor of these chops was lovely. We pan fried them, as directed then made a sauce with the drippings, a pat of butter, some hydrogenated mushrooms, white wine and chicken sauce.... so, so good. The pork was a tad on the dry side so next time I may only let them sit for a few minutes rather than the 8 that I did. Really tasty though and definitely easy. Thanks!"
798190,207576,2008-06-13,0,These beans are the best!  I also like to use the leftovers as a cold dip for potato chips.
515239,99746,2007-09-01,4,"This was delicious, but I had to nearly double the amount of flour and breadcrumbs in order to cover the tomatoes. This was a huge hit!"
869444,110548,2009-02-10,5,"Being from Cincy and having had my share of Skyline Chili for the past 25 years its needless to say that when we moved out West my husband and I truly missed our late night visits to Skyline Chili and everytime we went home we would eat there daily so we could get our fill till our next visit but now I can honestly say I can make this at home using this recipe and this is pretty darn close if not exactly like Skylline. The only difference is we took the advice from others and boiled our beef in the beef stock which is definitely worth the time because it makes the chili the same consistancy as the real deal  and we minced our onions and garlic in the food processor but the spices in this are RIGHT ON no changes need to be made and we did add the red pepper which you could barely taste but thanks so much Tornado Ali for posting this now we can have skyline chili anytime we crave it!! Also for the reviewer who said ""you've got to be kidding"" regarding the chocolate and cinnamon, obviouslly is not from Cincinnati or has never had Skyline Chili before so all I can say is try it you will get hooked just like the rest of us. :)"
163112,442890,2013-02-28,4,"Yum!  Nice & creamy.  I made it with 2TB cornstarch.  I think 3 might make it pudding-like, which wouldn't be a bad thing.  I'm not sure I'm so hepped up on the coconut flakes in it & might use coconut milk instead next time for the flavor. Made for NA/ME & Veggie forum's Sun & Spice Event 2/13."
599450,68649,2009-04-12,4,"This was pretty darn good! Made as directed except for one thing: I used bleu cheese dip in place of ranch because both DH and I prefer it. Great way to get your raw veggies! Thanks, lissaemtb! Made for <b>PAC Spring '09</b>"
68357,19253,2006-10-02,5,"Excellent recipe!  The 5 stars were for the salad and especially the dressing, which tasted just like Applebee's!  Oriental Chicken Salad is my favorite dish there.  YUM!  The only change I made to the dressing was to add 1/2 teaspoon of chicken bouillon granules, which added another flavor dimension.  

I'm not rating the chicken, because I used my regular method for breading and frying the chicken strips.

I tripled the recipe and served this as a luncheon for 6 women, and not one bite was left.  We could have used a little more dressing, so next time I will triple the recipe for 6 people.

Thanks for a great recipe I will be using often....maybe even as a dip for chicken fingers appetizers!"
932914,315262,2008-08-25,5,Very nice flavor and taste.  I served with a brown and wild rice pilaf.  I omitted the oil with no problem.  I also added more soy because I was using Braggs and didn't have to worry about sodium.  I used Fresh herbs so I increased the amount to equal the amount of dried herbs.  I need to add that our only complaint was that I didn't make double.  I also used Wild Rice Tempeh.  It was more than a five.
508312,138618,2009-01-27,5,"Yummy, and great fun!!  Even managed to scare somebody with one, hee hee!"
4470,64650,2003-07-08,4,"A wonderful family casserole - very tasty but not over spiced.  If you like things spicy it is very simple to add a bit of hot sauce at the table.  I felt it was a little heavy with the pasta and would cut it back to 3/4 lb nest time.. The recipe states 12 sevings I think this would depend on who is dining - I think 6-10 servings would be closer.  I used a 9 1/2""x14""x3"" casserole dish and it was full so you can judge the number of servings from that.  I  beat the eggs slightly before incorporating them into the other ingredients. Freezes well  Thanks for an excellent family recipe"
2000685907,75225,2015-11-17,5,"I was missing some ingredients so for the meat tenderizer I used 1 teaspoon of olive oil and some salt using advice from another review and for the garlic pepper I used half pepper, half garlic powder also using someone else&#039;s review. It turned out amazing. I will definitely reuse the recipe."
169411,97573,2005-09-16,4,"I tasted good. It needed more spice for me however.
 It was thick enough without the cornstarch so I omitted that. "
41894,131018,2006-07-23,5,I made this for a family reunion.  Doubled it and it was all gone!  I added one regular and one spicy hot sauce and it seemed like it could use more so I added another spicy hot.  Everyone loved it and it was so simple. I will make this again for my hub reunion next weekend!
280979,68328,2006-12-14,3,"This was good but not great.  I like the halo halo mixture that you could buy in a bottle from an oriental store much better.  Im sure some people would like this, but DH and I thought it was ok."
74652,70117,2003-09-19,5,Well.... I think I finally found the recipe for a TGIFs salad dressing that they no longer have on the menu!  I absolutely loved it on their Cobb Salad and its just not the same without it!  I can't wait to make this!  Thanks for sharing!
2000407119,83634,2017-11-18,5,"Fantastic and easy recipe. Flavorful but non fussy. Loved it, I added jalape&ntilde;os topped with a little butter salt and chili powder for the adult side and it was all gone in no time. Comfortably feeds 4 adults as a stand-alone meal."
209130,170248,2006-06-12,2,I would have loved to give this a higher rating. Sadly though it wasn't quite what I was expecting.  The recipe didn't specify if it was the Firber One flakes or buds cereal.  I had the buds so maybe that is why they turned out so dry & heavy.  They did have a good flavour with all the cinnamon though.  I am going to try this recipe again & add some applesauce & see if that helps.  Hopefully I will be able to give it a better rating as the ingredients are a great idea for high fibre & protein.
554496,76630,2007-09-25,5,"This recipe is fabulous....I've been making it for years so was thrilled to see it on this site that I had to give it a 5 star rating.  It is so very simple that you might not think this could be so delicious.  Just be sure the cauliflower is in bite sizes to make it easy to eat.  I use a 9x13 pan rather than a bowl.  

The only thing different is I mix the parmesan cheese with the mayo before spreading it on the cauliflower.  The bacon makes it wonderful and a real guy pleaser.  And, it stores beautifully in the refrigerator overnight and that's why it's important to spread the mayo on the cauliflower and not on the 
lettuce.

There are never any leftovers from this salad.
Thanks, Sudie."
214618,81621,2007-01-28,5,"Thanks for the authentic recipe of your grandmothers!  I'm blessed to live within driving distance of East Providence RI where I go to Gaipo's Market for their fresh chourico (pr. Shur-eez) sausage. I like the hot version, sometimes I add in linguica.  I've never added sherry or wine to my kale soup and I'll be sure to try it on the next batch.  I make huge batches of this soup because it is great fresh, and even better on the second or third day (if it isn't gone by then)"
58210,35775,2007-03-28,4,"This is yummy!  Easy to put together, very tasty, and pretty ecomonical to make. A neighbor gave me a dozen eggs from her chickens and I needed to use the ones I had purchased the week before.  We had this for dinner and everyone liked it.  I used sausage and omited the tomato, but other than that made as indicated.  Thanks for a great recipe."
628076,346053,2009-02-06,5,This was great. I steamed mine and then put on the plate and drizzled the butter and sprinkled the rest on top. Very good. DH who normally doesn't eat alot of broccoli went back for seconds!! Yahoo.
1880217,247699,2011-04-10,0,"Well, they look great for the kiddies.  Adult tastes might find them a bit too sweet.  Additionally, the use of artificial stuff isn't my bailiwick.  I like real butter, not cooking spray, and I like real sugar when I use it, not a synthetic like Splenda.  Try Stevia instead, and use a lot less.  also, use real natural peanut butter, like Smuckers that is made with no sugar.  And use about half the brown sugar, same reason .. too sweet!  Use a bit of molasses instead."
1589782,47651,2013-11-11,5,"This was my first time to make roux, and I was so nervous! Thanks to this great recipe with clear/specific instructions, it was a huge success and we had some delicious gumbo for dinner!!"
601182,142936,2007-12-05,5,"OMG...  For all those people who don't like stuffing, here is one that will change you forever.  It was worth the time to follow step by step...  I used Jimmy Dean sausage and added mild Italian Sausage.  Can you say ""Delicious?"""
76835,57763,2003-10-20,5,"EXCELLENT!!! and so easy to prepare.  I made it and served it to my family last evening.  One asked for seconds which finished off the pie!  My daughter is making it for her women's group next week.  It's a nice change from the traditional apple pie but with all the flavor and more.  It's a keeper in my recipe file.  I can't wait to make it for my friends in Florida soon.  Thanks for posting it.

704950,300227,2008-04-30,5,The heat is just right on these if you like spicy food!  I love the Mexican colors of this marinade after it blends!!  We can get fresh nopales/cactus in the grocery store here in AZ but I used the kind in a jar because I figured that was what this recipe intended.  Also drained the nopalitos before blending.  I cut my adobo chiles up so they would blend better.  I did not marinate and I did bake these rather than grill them at 450 degrees F for 35 minutes.  The pickle-like taste of the nopalitos pairs well with the lime juice and the flavor is subtle in the cooked wing.  Very good and cool thing to make for Cinco de Mayo!!  Thanks for the recipe!
236760,160432,2006-03-21,5,"No way!  You eat these also?  I have been eating this as my FAVORITE sandwich since I was in jr high - 30 years ago....I usually use dill pickles though.  Sometimes, I will add a little mustard as well.  Yes, we are weird, but it is a great sandwich!  "
1287027,66703,2010-02-03,5,So so good! I used half butter half Crisco. Worked perfectly! Thank you very much for a yummy cookie!
162826,120363,2008-09-05,5,"Delicious!! I cut the red potatoes into slices--extra thin and browned in the bacon drippings, then layered in the other ingredients (adding slice mushrooms. EXCELLENT dinner with Pillsbury Grands for the Breakfast Anytime Event in Cooking Photos!"
711772,115335,2008-01-01,5,"I did as suggested by another reviewer, and reduced the amount of Italian seasoning.  It turned out great!  I also added a little bit of salt to the gravy, to taste, but that's up to the individual of course.  Fantastic recipe, ShaGun.  Thank you!"
2640829,4151,2013-03-22,5,"Overall, it is a very light, moist muffin. I used vanilla yogurt and left out the coconut. I added a few strawberries. I dont think I used enough lemon zest (only one tablespoon). Being a lemon lover next time I will use lemon yogurt and add a little extra lemon juice. For the topping I didn&#039;t used coconut or sugar. Instead I used some honey and lemon juice. There are a lot of different things you can add to this recipe and still come out with something delicous"
708697,226167,2008-02-14,5,I made this in my dehydrator and it came out awesome! Thanks for the recipe - made just as directed.  I am making my second batch now!
498271,360231,2012-03-28,5,WOW this is a great dressing!  I love thousand island and this did not disappoint - it's terrific.  The touch of chili paste gave this the perfect zip.  I've never made thousand island dressing before but I will be making it often now - thanks for sharing a keeper!  Made for Spring Pick-A-Chef 2012
1573654,41228,2010-03-09,4,"Re: ""low cooking temp"" referenced in Dec 29 review, 180 degrees celsius = 350 degrees fahrenheit."
41578,352749,2010-10-24,5,"Well this certainly deserves 10 stars!!!!  This quick and easy sauce is delicious and can be used on cakes and ice cream.  I served it on top of pound cake and my guests went crazy over it and asked for the recipe.  I highly recommend this to everyone...you won't be disappointed.  Thanks for sharing it, Mikekey."
91724,61826,2006-01-22,4,"I didn't want a spicy dish so I omitted the cayenne and chili, everything else the same. The combination of flavors was really good, especially the caraway seed, which I usually don't think of as an ingredient in Indian dishes. I think the caraway made the dish. Very nice recipe. "
296027,134606,2006-10-11,4,"Lovely-also added a bit of onions. I grew up with my Dad making glazed carrots- similar just use brown sugar, carrots and sometmes onions,usually not though.  Nice spin using the potatoes- I hadn't thought to try them.;) Thank you! I have been looking at a few of your other recipes too!! YUMMY"
496803,362347,2012-05-07,4,"I really enjoyed this!  The flavor of the ground coriander really made an impact in this dish. It's one of my favorite herbs, and added a lot of depth to the flavor. I was also very pleased to use the fresh tarragon from my herb garden.  I used thighs this time, and it was a great combination of flavors.  Made for PRMR."
567976,190117,2009-09-23,5,"What a fun, different way to use all those summer tomatoes.  Mine's got quite a kick after using 4 jalapenos (didn't have serranos) but it's balanced by the sweetness of the sugar.  This will be a great appetizer with crackers and cream cheese."
159532,64235,2008-08-04,5,"I just finished making this, so my review is based upon what i could scrape out of the bottom of the pot.  All I have to say is -WOW!!  After reading all the reviews, I made 2 changes based on personal preference...I used my emersion blender while it was cooking because I don't like big chunks in my blueberries and I used 1 cup less sugar.  I find most blueberry jam too sweet.  After careful consideration, I loved it.  It seems to have jelled perfectly and the taste is heavenly.  Thank you for posting Sharon123, I might not have tried this, otherwise..."
179133,116462,2005-02-28,4,"For ease of prep I would give this 5*, taste 4* (I would like it better without nuts I think), and removing from the pan, 2* (had major trouble). I used 1/2 cup wine and a 6 oz pkg. of apricots (cut up with kitchen shears). Will make again but without the nuts."
679703,192406,2008-05-08,4,These muffins were delicious and fluffy. I will defenently make theses again.
39835,121959,2011-04-15,5,Great fruit salad! I think next time though I may skip the orange juice and the sugar -- the fruit is probablly sweet enough by itself. I did use splenda for the sugar without any problems. We had this for dinner with fish but I am hoping there is some leftovers to have with yogurt for breakfast. Thanks for sharing!
95743,34011,2004-04-26,5,Add me to the list of fans.  Perfect as is.  Wouldn't change a thing.
553178,5083,2007-08-20,5,"OUTSTANDING!!!  I have never made my own dumplings because of all the failures my mom had with them.  This recipe is right on, the consistency was perfect.  My whole family loved it and asked for it again!"
54716,22097,2003-01-20,5,Nice flavour exposion!  Fresh without all that sodium feedback you get from the jar versions.  You'll never buy store bought again after you've tried this!
303545,138709,2007-03-01,5,"This is exactly the same dish that my grandma and mom make, but we call it something else in the islands!  My absolute favorite comfort food--I can never eat just one (or five).  Thanks Tunasushi!"
349739,182035,2009-07-07,5,"Wonderful recipe.  12 minutes under the broiler ended up overcooking the fish a bit- so I think next time I will check it after 9-10 minutes.
My husband is not a huge fish fan and he enjoyed this dish, so it is definitely a keeper!!
Thanks for a great recipe."
1983275,196139,2011-08-15,5,I love grilling Chickens. This is the best recipe I came across in recent days. I think it will taste great to Grilling Beef & Shrimp. You can add fish sauce to give it a Thai touch to it.
353579,353016,2009-11-16,5,"Really easy, really good. I put in an extra step and rolled each ball in a combination of grated parmesan, oregano and garlic powder. I also doubled the recipe and put it in a bundt pan, so it took a bit longer to cook through. A real crowd pleaser - thanks for posting!"
4470,51141,2003-03-02,5," 5 star all the way.  Great color presentation and the different shapes of the ingredients add to the eye appeal. Taste appeat?  I wish you could have seen this salad disappear.  I served it withrecipe#588 Fragrant Lamb Stew with dried fruits, rice steamed carrots & steamed Brussels Sprouts.  The salad was so refreshing  and even with the jalapeno & chili flakes was not hot.  I used hot ground chili in place of  the ground red pepper. I could not get red Jalapeno so used green finely chopped.  Thanks Meanchef for a great salad recipe."
2001941934,349246,2018-01-19,5,My 9 yr old son liked it
242007,114392,2010-04-06,5,Absolutely delicious!  Don't hesitate to try this recipe.
131126,93168,2004-07-19,4,"I was intrigued by the use of buttermilk in this recipe. I was very impressed with the resulting dish. It has a slightly tart but mildly spicy taste that is very pleasing. I thought this was a good use of contest ingredients!! I did have to add almost a cup of additional stock and increase the cooking time to get the rice tender, but that could have been the brand of brown rice I used. Good Job."
680579,19724,2008-06-12,5,"I wish I could give 10 starts!!  These were awesome, so easy to make and they melt in your mouth.  Great flavor.  The best recipe I've tried, by far.  Thanks so much for posting!!"
102672,108948,2007-11-18,2,Maybe it was the way I cooked it or something but this tasted so greasy I just couldn't stand to eat more than a couple bites (and I did use olive oil).
92641,94395,2005-03-14,5,"I made and cubed some garlic bread to dip into this as a snack. It was really tasty. Though the combination of flavors is a bit different than the typical American cuisine, they come together nicely and compliment eachother well.  I'd like to try it with grilled shrimp too.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Martha :)"
1802986713,44133,2014-08-02,5,I agree that you need to be very careful with the addition of any salt. When you salt to taste this is the best macaroni salad ever!
482376,4627,2010-11-05,5,"FABULOUS! Loved this recipe!! The flavor for an excellent chicken tortilla soup is ""spot on"" here. The only change I will make next time is to try omitting the cheese from the cooking process and just using it as a garnish. I thought the soup was already perfect before adding the cheese! Thanks for posting. :)"
469534,109699,2008-01-24,5,"I'm from SC but when I was a child, my family went to the famous Maid-Rite shoppe in Marshalltown, Iowa (my stepmother grew up in Iowa). Ever since, I've remembered how delicious they were and I was delighted to find this recipe so that I could have them again. Thank you for posting! The idea to use hot dog buns for children is a good one....must use white bread buns for this one folks!"
2528442,87073,2012-11-26,5,"This recipe was fantastic in both it's simplicity and it's results.  Crunchy, crispy fried shrimp that tasted like shrimp, not breading!  A must try recipe."
468227,28927,2008-01-24,5,"It was excellent!!! I bought a meatloaf pan to use for this recipe and what a difference it makes!!! I think next time I am going to try to add bacon across the top after cutting the slices at the halfway point!!! Excellent recipe thanks for posting!!! FYI this recipe was featured by me at magicalholidayhome.com forums for our January Test it, Taste it, Rate it recipes and has done ""5 stars"" by almost everyone so far!!!"
122993,102054,2004-12-03,5,"This is so good and couldn't be easier to make. No fail! I did leave out the nuts as we don't care for them. I used milk chocolate chips because that is what we had on hand. I plan on making more of this to put on the candy platters for Christmas gatherings using peanut butter, cinnamon, and mint chocolate chips."
1956875,281425,2011-07-14,5,Awesome! Couldn't get enough of it.
427184,30600,2007-07-19,4,"Nice dish, I really enjoyed it. The flavor was great, the salmon tasted wonderful with the sesame seeds and ginger, it was very good. Next time I'll use more bok choy for a larger portion. Thanks for posting."
300755,31639,2009-04-26,5,I made this dip for my boyfriend and he loved it! Everything came out perfect and he's asking when I'm going to make it again! Thanks for sharing the recipe Jenn =) Bravo!
309630,199845,2008-12-23,5,Thanks for sharing this recipe. This recipe is a nice change from the same old brownie.
232480,107017,2007-11-09,3,I made this up and then froze it to have after my son was born.  It was good but had far too much liquid for my tastes.  I think when I try it again I will cut back the milk to 1/2 c.
66983,82888,2004-09-07,4,"Yum, easy, used boneless as that's all I had.  Good stuff, great dinner, thanks Barb"
1014369,258094,2008-11-04,5,"One that my whole family will eat- that is an accomplishment!! YUMMY!! We topped with sour cream and cheese, and tortilla chips...but it has a lot of flavor and smelled sooo good all day in the crock pot! Definitely one we will make over and over!!"
121178,19047,2004-11-16,5,"This was the BEST recipe and very easy and fast, too. 
I did use only chicken breasts (my preference) but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.
My picky family devoured this dish down and asked for 3rds!
Thanks for the great post!"
444132,333229,2009-04-13,5,"Fantastic bread - I like that it makes two loaves, and the mix of grains is excellent.  I did substitute 2 cups of the whole wheat flour with Robin Hood Multigrain, as I was low on whole wheat, and it turned out great!  I'll be making this again!  Thanks, Bill!  Made for PAC Spring '09."

2000228079,217753,2015-05-26,5,"This was so colorful and delicious!  It will be a new fav of mine, and it went over well at our family gathering.  
I used a little less than 1/2 cup sugar and the full 2 TBS apple cider vinegar.  The dressing in this recipe was creamy with just the perfect amount of sweetness.  
We didn&#039;t have as much fresh broccoli so I mixed it with a thawed bag of frozen broccoli dumped right in from the bag, and it was just fine.  Added in halved cherry tomatoes, Craisins, and sharp cheddar cut into tiny cubes.   Microwaved the bacon on paper towels and a plate.  
Thank u for the healthy, tasty recipe and also the tips from others."
383346,237736,2008-06-01,5,"Again, this is DH's rating.  I tasted it.  It is very tropical because of guava juice.  But the campari has a bitter taste that stays so I didn't like it.  He loved it.  I used peach schnapps.  Thanks Amanda.  Made for ZWT4"
518275,27520,2009-10-01,4,This is virtually identical to what I grew up with and still make today - only I use shells & 1 can of stewed toms.  My mother calls it Slumgullion.  And it is really good - the flavors just meld together.
39334,94759,2005-02-24,4,"This was super easy to make, and I really liked the brown sugar/mustard glaze on the pork chops. I didn't care for the stuffing, but I think it was because of the onions because I don't like onions, but my DH really liked it. This was good and we will probably make again. Thanks for posting! "
45400946,277207,2017-06-25,4,"I put a pat of butter under the skin of my bone in thighs. I find when baking or roasting this will keep your meat very moist. Ok, I'll have a photo ... great ,simple recipe ??"
668861,35332,2008-11-17,5,Tried it last night for dinner side dish We loved it! Great combination of flavors thanks!
287948,61103,2006-01-26,5,"I made this recipe with small chicken pieces and I have served it with both gnocchi and hokkien noodles. It was delicious both times, and tastes even better heated up the day after."
69906,28747,2005-11-05,4,"I'm not sure if I like this or not. I like a lot of spices and I felt something was missing. I didn't have any crushed tomatoes on hand so I just made do with the sauce and paste. I added onion, garlic and fried bacon bits to both. I only added half of the parmesan cheese thinking it would be to over bearing, which it wasn't to my surprise. I was worried about socking the bread but, that was fine. I did love the fact that you could bake the meatballs! I did spay some Pam on the foil so they would not stick. Over all it was a okay recipe..... Thanks for sharing!"
488244,63689,2007-10-10,5,"Wonderful recipe!  The kids and I loved it.  They've asked for it over and over again, and they don't care for the store bought stuff at all.  Thank you for the many wonderful dinners I've had and will have from this!"
646304,29100,2011-07-11,5,"This took so long to make, I was hoping it would be good.  How dissapointing it would have been if I'd messed this up. All the time, and staying close to home while it spent a day rising was so very worth it. Too bad it didn't last more than 15 minutes.  Making more now, sad we have to wait again. Especially now that we know what we are getting at the end of the wait."
2001299762,80156,2016-12-15,5,"This is my first review on a recipe site. I have to say after making gingerbread cookies for a really long time that this is the best recipe I have ever made. I searched recipes based on wanting to use butter rather than margarine or shortening. I did make the dough a day in advance of using, stored it in the fridge overnight, but set it out on the counter for about 30 minutes and it was a wonderful texture to roll and use cookie cutters with. I baked at 350 degrees, my oven runs a little warm, for 8 minutes and the results were great. Can't wait to share this recipe with my family!"
1518304,28165,2011-09-05,5,"Awesome recipe, tastes very close to restaurant quality.  The only issue I had was the rice was a bit over cooked by the time it was done.  Probably use a bit less liquid next time to try and remove some of the mushiness of the rice.  Still very tasty though."
127988,40497,2006-08-26,5,Have made these several times and they always come out great.  Perfect for a buffet table....are quick to make and bake.  Sometimes add cayenne pepper to the flour.  I use part vegetable  oil and part butter.
1674316,429261,2010-11-29,2,I didn't care for this. It sounded like it would be really delicious but the flavour wasn't strong enough for me. I didn't like the combination of the quinoa with pineapple.
2791625,464815,2013-04-19,5,"I loved this recipe! I actually made it into a 8inch cake for someone&#039;s birthday and people loved it!! It is delicious, moist, and not too sweet! I did not use the lemon zest as I do not have it, but as in a previous comment, I also noticed it was not needed. Also, it did not rise as much, but it still worked out perfectly for my cake!"
2002344910,340469,2018-11-22,5,I searched &quot;not too sweet sweet potato recipe&quot; while preparing for our dinner club's last meeting at our home. This recipe was perfect. Everyone loved it. We are having it again today for Thanksgiving.
117835,109918,2009-01-24,5,"Excellent, thank you!  I made this without the meringue and it was excellent."
39835,62910,2003-10-01,5,Excellent bread! I did have to add a bit extra flour but I think that is my machine and I used a little less chives than specified. Thanks Kim for sharing.
145125,130525,2009-08-05,4,Made this last night for a little change of pace from the meat and potatoes. I followed the recipe and onlt added some S & P for taste. Nice quick dish after working all day. Thanks
36902,31567,2006-02-12,5,"It was my boyfriend's idea to prepare this dish, and it was incredibly delicious and flavorful.
I wasn't sure, but we used canned salted pistachios, which turned out to be perfect.  I also softened the butter before processing, which made the consistency exactly what it needed to be.
We served the salmon on top of a mound of delicious risotto.  We used recipe # 32295 ""Magnificent 1st Prize Risotto,"" (same prep time as the fish!) and the total package was on par with a nice dinner we had a a fabulous local restaurant.  Top notch all the way!"
146284,468254,2012-04-02,5,"Yes, I would call this dish ""truly beautiful"" as well.  Easy and delicious... definitely make-again-able!  I did make one change, necessary for our family, of substituting Splenda for the sugar, but I don't think that made any difference to the well received pork chops."
2000927144,307995,2016-03-19,4,"Not bad, simple.  I just wanted to add that i use fat to fry rather than oil. thats what ive always known people to use round my neck of the woods.  Save bacon grease, ham grease, usually keep it in a jar or coffee can.  sometimes ill mix them, little oil, little fat.  it adds flavor to an otherwise pretty bland side.  i&#039;ll also throw in some seasoning like Old Bay to give it a little flavor.  This works well to if you want something simple to bread and fry your fish in."
107135,139513,2005-10-30,5,i saw the great picture and thought i like creamsicles... thanks for posting  ill be drinking alot of these next summer dee
693345,103516,2011-01-26,4,"I am not a huge meatloaf fan, but this is a nice change to beef. I omitted the bell peppers, because I didn't want to make a trip to the store just for those, but I made the rest of the recipe as directed, using 2 eggs. I found that I basically used heaping 1/4 cup measures (three) of oats, because it was a bit wet with level measures. My husband and I thought the meatloaf was good, but needed a little something (like herbs or something - but we can't put our finger on it). I served this with Recipe #322275 and Recipe #285270. It was good, and I would probably make it again. Thanks!"
112165,48973,2004-07-04,5,Made this for our 3rd of July party and it was almost instantly gone! Wonderful dip! 
58104,107741,2005-05-04,5,"How much easy and tasty can it be? I used 1 tablespoon fresh tarragon, 2 scallions which was close to 1/2 cup, chicken broth was my choice today for this because thats what I had. Garnished with fresh tarragon. Very Good, Creamy  and like I said, Easy!"
89831,8794,2005-05-29,4,"This was good but not the best by far. I Used Kraft sun-dried Tomato with oregano salad dressing, and found the salad to be on the dry side, I had to add in some olive oil. I also added in about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, and used cherry tomatoes. My son really enjoyed this, thanks for sharing!...Kittencal:)"
226867,427407,2011-10-27,5,"Well, how can you go wrong with peanut butter and bananas?  I did use high-fiber wheat bread, though! made for PAC fall 2011"
258350,105670,2008-01-10,5,"I am so grateful to have found this recipe. I changed a bit thanks to reading some of the other reviews and added a twist of my own.I cut enough of the peppers lengthwise to form a small boat, leaving the stem on. I removed the seeds and membrane.I precooked the bacon half way and put to the side. I cooked some extra bacon all the way and mix it in the cream cheese as well as chopped up a few green onions and added a small amount of red pepper jelly, mixing it all together with the cream cheese. Putting the cream cheese mixture to the jalapeÃÂ±o boat. I then wrapped the half cooked bacon around the jalapeÃÂ±o and baked it in the oven until done. The sweet heat from the pepper jelly was a big hit. I layed the jalapeÃÂ±o boats on a bed of lettuce on a party tray. Looked beautiful and the lettuce help soak up any grease if any from the jalapeÃÂ±os."
65029,61736,2004-01-19,5,"Absolutely delicious!  I was worried potatoes would dry out or taste leftover, but they were fantastic the next day.  I also made a sweet potato casserole (#41988), so there was no last minute mashing!  It really took the pressure off and I could relax intead of spending the entire day cooking.  I cooked my turkey in a roaster oven, so I would have room for casseroles.  "
825969,238994,2009-05-23,5,Wonderful dish. Be careful not to oversalt.
482933,423137,2012-03-25,4,"Very tasty!  Simple to make.  Served with rice and green beans.  Thank you for sharing, alligirl."
1663686,64588,2012-11-03,1,Did not come out very well.  Did not brown. Was very disappointing.
128473,458220,2017-03-23,5,"These dutch babies were awesome. I made them yesterday for a friend and mine. We both enjoyed them tremendously. So good, quick and really easy to make with terrific results. The pancake puffed up beautifully, the apples were tender and delicious. Thanks for sharing this lovely recipe, which I will make again and again. Made for What's on the Menu? tag game."
537937,463076,2012-05-06,5,This dressing is just the perfect flavor combination of sweet/sour.  I love it!!!!
482376,428627,2010-06-15,5,I was surprised that I liked this recipe as much as I did. I thought it was fantastic. The pistachios were my favorite addition. Easy to make earlier in the day and serve later. Thank you! ~Made for Zee Zesties on the ZWT6~
67899,131109,2005-12-04,5,"This is very unique and tasty! I thought it would taste pretty similar to other tuna salad sandwiches, but the raisin bread really gave it sweetness and made it stand out. Plus the dijon mustard gave it a little zip. I put it on Recipe Faiy's Cinnamon Raisin Bread for the Bread Machine Recipe #47111, and it made an absolutely awesome sandwich!"
2198132,518068,2014-08-24,5,"Wow, what a creative recipe!!  Yum!"
47892,340621,2010-01-17,5,"Count me in, too, as a fan of recipes with history. Fascinating introduction and helpful instructions. The first batch I stuck to the recipe exactly as written although I used 2 1/2 teaspoons of Bob's Red Mill active dry yeast with no problems. The next day I replaced half of the white flour with whole wheat flour. For the third batch coming up this week I will cut down the whole wheat to between 1-1 1/2 cups for better texture and more so for personal preference. A ridiculously simple yeast bread recipe that I would recommend for bread making beginners. My brand spankin' new KitchenAid stand up mixer came in quite useful for mixing the dough and handled six cups of flour like a true champ! My husband loves this bread (as does ~Tasty~) and he has asked me to teach him how to prepare it! Thank you once again, French Toast for a beautiful recipe. cg ;) PS if you have time, read through the reviews. There is a wealth of information provided."
537937,181530,2008-01-15,5,"A really hearty and satisfying meal and somewhat rich.  The cream sauce is definitely a must.  If anything to change, I'd add a few more greek spices next time.  I also left out the pinch of cinnamon.  I'm really glad I tagged and tried this for PhotoTag 08.!!"
347909,115153,2009-12-03,3,"This was good - not fantastic tho.  I added my own seasonings, but we didn't get that ""popcorn"" feel at all.  Not a bad way to have cauli but I think there's better out there."
222478,109750,2012-08-06,5,Yum! Really well balanced flavor and great moist chicken. I made all as directed other than adding some pineapple and red bell pepper to the sauce.
219657,120326,2005-07-17,4,"Good easy recipe.  I was looking for something to do with butternut squash, preferably a vegetarian dish, and this fit the bill.  Quick and simple.  Very good with couscouse."
46545,14381,2003-03-24,5,"Great flavor and so easy!  The mustard is delicious with poatoes.  I added a squeeze of lemon juice to the spices and mustard (because of the suggestions here and to moisten it up a bit), and sprayed the potatoes with cooking spray a couple of times while baking.  I love spicy food, so used hot paprika and sprinkled on extra cayenne when the potatoes came out of the oven.  Didn't miss the salt one bit.  Thanks for a SUPER potato recipe Sueie!!!   "
369715,372497,2010-04-22,5,I have never made pudding that didn't come out of a box. I followed the recipe exactly as written and this was very easy to make. We all enjoyed this. Made for Spring PAC 2010.
2002108923,82102,2018-04-11,5,Loved it! Used half panko bread crumbs and half garlic &amp; herb bread crumbs and baked on a rack. Definitely a keeper!
866963,141983,2010-08-29,5,"I made this tonight for my daughter and her 2 friends and this was so easy and came out terrific!  I sliced a boneless chicken breast and sauteed it in some olive oil, salt, pepper, and about 2 cloves of chopped garlic and added about 1 cup of cut broccoli which I cooked until it was crisp tender.  Instead of angel hair we used penne.  I did add a bit of salt and about 1/4 cup of grated Asiago cheese to the sauce.  When the sauce was done I mixed the pasta with the chicken and broccoli and poured the sauce over the top."
429710,160798,2007-04-16,5,My husband is picky about his ribs soI made these for him to try. He was sure that I went to the rib hut and got these. I showed him the crock pot and he was amazed. They are so good. He took all the left overs to work with him. Thanks for the great recipe. I am sure I will be using it often..
1800078245,56762,2015-12-08,5,Very easy ! Used 1 cup of Splenda in place of sugar!
789516,28261,2011-06-18,5,I used 20oz of stewed tomatoes (we don't have small cans of stewed tomatoes in canada)  This was very good!
849647,130108,2008-06-02,0,"This was great. I used onion powder instead of onions (I don't care for raw onions). I also added red pepper flakes, spicy brown mustard,  and grapes... ate it on a spinach wrap and LOVED it! Thanks for a great recipe!"
230102,272391,2008-11-20,5,"Very good!   I cooked 1 cup dry lentils and ended up with 1 full cup and 1 scant cup cooked.  By the time I got to the add tomato sauce step, it was pretty much already to the form the loaf state, so I only added a couple of tablespoons of ketchup.  Next time, I will cook 1 cup + 2 tablespoons of lentils, use quick oats and saute the onion and any other veggies I might add in.  I can think of a lot of things that would be good in this.  The old fashioned oats gave it a rougher texture.  It was surprisingly very similar to regular beef meat-loaf.  I did use the egg and cheese options.  I just patted it into a small ceramic baking dish.  Jean #7, thanks for a wonderful recipe--it's a keeper!"
162826,29805,2004-10-23,5,"Nurse Di...oppps, I forgot to rate it...5 ****** of course!"
573325,361462,2009-09-20,5,"Mmm, these cookies are really, really good!!!
They are soft on the inside with a slightly creamy touch from the beans and the edges are slightly crispy. The taste is so yummy! The vanilla and cinnamon go so well with the rest of the ingredients and theres something fruity, something, nutty and something sweet depending on where you bite into your cookie. :) That most of the ingredients are really healthy is an added plus. 
I made half the recipe and ended up with 18 fairly big cookies.
Other than using sunflower seeds in place of the nuts (Im allergic) and reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup I stuck to your recipe and it was so great!
THANKS SO VERY MUCH for sharing this super recipe with us, Leanne! Ill definitely make it again!
Made and reviewed for one of my babies during PAC Fall 09."
1254424,8384,2009-05-02,1,No flavor at all. Followed the directions exactly as written. Wish I liked this because it was simple to make.
128473,295735,2012-05-21,5,"My dh & I love carrots.  We have tried many carrot recipes on this site and Jackie let me tell you, this recipe is right up there with the best of them.  They were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The carrots were, sweet, tender and very flavorful. I loved that you could actually taste, the carrots, shallots, orange juice, honey, ginger and cayenne.  Sooo good, really nice balance between, sweet, spicy and hot. Thank you for sharing another new family favorite. Made for Aussie Swap/ May - 12."
2002304197,192661,2018-10-17,4,Way too much cinnamon
221231,149195,2005-12-25,5,I place a few drops of green colouring in the peppermint frosting and the contrast makes the appearance as great as the taste.
296546,261951,2012-10-20,5,"I've made this recipe several times... I clipped it out of a magazine a while back.  I was glad to see that it was posted :^) Definitely a family favorite!  My neighbor's daughter asks me to make them for her all the time!  Oh, and need I say SUPER EASY!"
230860,103469,2009-12-10,4,"This was good, but I didn't think much of the flavors remained with the salmon.  I marinated for pretty close to the 2 hours even.  I cooked it up on my foreman grill which allows the juices to run clear though so maybe doing it in the oven or something would change that.  Either way it was very easy and a nice way to prepare salmon and we will likely do this again, maybe adding some sesame seeds to it or something next time."
1373529,94234,2009-12-18,5,"I sooo love this recipe.  It does take a long time at first,but I'm getting faster everytime I make it. :)  I add more cheese & dill."
1561184,20643,2010-02-25,5,"This really was easy and very tasty also. The whole family enjoyed it. I served it with ""bourbon chicken Recipe #45809"" and it made for a very satisfying meal. Thanks for the great recipe!"
790104,297160,2008-05-02,5,"I adjusted this recipe to fit my 1 lb. Zojirushi mini (used 1/2 of all the ingredients) and it was fantastic!  I used a lot less butter, only about 1 TBSP, and it turned out fine.  Also, I added a bit more flour during kneading because it was a little too sticky. My machine doesn't have a ""sweet bread"" setting so I set it on ""soft"" and it came out perfectly golden and moist."
156034,42069,2010-07-29,4,"This is a very good cake and everyone really enjoyed it.  I do think next time I will cut back just a little on the powdered sugar as that amount did make it really sweet.   You have to cut it in small squares.  I also had to increase my baking time by 5 minutes, but I'm sure that each oven is slightly different.  I used a butter recipe cake mix and it was a really quick, easy and good dessert."
64583,17394,2008-04-15,5,"This makes a great meatloaf.  I used lean ground turkey and it turned out very moist and flavorful.  I loved that it held it's shape when I put it on a serving platter.  Besides using ground turkey instead of beef, I also used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce on top because I discovered I was completely out of brown sugar.  Thanks Bev!"
312577,30359,2009-01-05,5,"Very delicious crabcakes.  I made mine into minature/appetizer sized crab cakes and got about 14 crab cakes.  I added a dash of onion powder and seasoning salt.  These crabcakes were so good and easy to make.  
I will definitely use this recipe again."
955167,31266,2008-09-13,5,This is my new favourite wings recipe.  They taste fantastic!!  I do mine in the oven @ 350 for an hour but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.
207000,134215,2007-01-24,4,This is a great idea when short on time. I changed things up a little bit because I didn't have some of the ingredients you listed and it was great. I used tomato sauce instead of rotel tomatoes and I used black beans instead of pinto beans. I didn't need the tomato paste because I was using tomato sauce. It was great. I also added some cumin to give it another kick and it turned out great. Thanks for the idea!
517298,84247,2010-08-24,5,"Very easy and very tasty!<br/>I used my baking stone, flipped half way through so both sides got nicely browned"
251917,332014,2009-01-05,5,Aussie Swap#24: Super easy and very flavorful!! Wonderful reheated too!!
46660,21686,2002-11-19,4,"This was very good!  I thought the hamburger mixture was a little bit mealy, but that is probably because I used store bought breadcrumbs instead of fresh.  Thanks for the recipe!"
68715,95254,2004-08-16,5,"These are so good! They look wonderful! So chocolatey! I baked the first bunch at 375F for the allotted time, but some of them scorched on the bottom. For the second bunch, I lowered to temperature to 350F and added a few minutes to the baking time. They came out perfect. Toward the end of rolling the first bunch of balls for coating with icing sugar, the dough was sticking badly to my hands. I put it back in the fridge for a short time before forming the second bunch. Great recipe. I'll be adding it to my collection of favourites."
727423,275997,2008-02-03,5,"My husband declared this a winner, and the kids loved it too. I made the black beans from dried beans (cooked in the stock pot with vegetable stock, onions & garlic). I used 7 oz of Gimme Lean sausage and brown rice tortillas 'cause that's what I had on hand. Yummmm!!!"
192483,200296,2008-01-29,5,"This is so easy, and my family LOVES it! My 21 and 17 year old sons beg me to make it every week. Thank you for a great and easy recipe!"
847456,17934,2010-01-28,5,"Great!  I'm pretty picky about the texture of spinach and beans, but this worked.  I only added 1 cup of broth and let it cook down longer - until it was more like sauce than soup."
2001037537,108231,2017-05-05,0,I don't understand people who take a recipe and then change it completely and then give it five stars.
1306775,123008,2009-06-30,3,"I only had 2 overripe nectarines on hand, but did the same prep work. Unfortunately there was almost no liquid to drain after the 1 hour refridgeration time. It didn't matter though because we ate it with whipped cream instead. Delish."
303700,383541,2010-04-25,5,"Made for PAC Spring 2010
Simple and delicious over pasta...I added some sauteed mushrooms and sweet red peppers."
126440,93575,2011-07-01,5,Loved the basil butter on these kabobs.  I may cook them a little longer but they were great served with grilled packet potatoes and grilled pork chops.
203111,131300,2010-07-31,2,"When I see a recipe with so many good reviews, I expect it to be something special.  Sorry to say, this was not.  Although the consistency of the batter was ok, I thought the taste was very bland, very disappointing...just not worth all the mess.  I ended up peeling the crust off my zucchini slices and reheating them with garlic and parmesan and eating it that way instead."
28177,265307,2011-04-06,5,"Incredible!  Probably my favorite salmon recipe yet.  I love Sambal and it paired very well with the sweetness of the brown sugar and also I had to use homemade crystallized ginger, because I didn't realize I hadn't bought any fresh since making a new batch.  But it wasn't too sweet or too spicy.  I served it with Evelyn/Athens' Confetti Rice and Bean Salad and it was wonderful!  I did get carried away with the marinade on top.  I forgot I was only making one fillet and made the full marinade recipe.  However, I couldn't be happier with a little extra!  :)  Thanks for sharing, Rita!  Made and enjoyed for TOTM forum's Catch of the Day! seafood tag game."
129652,32331,2005-05-10,3,"My HB and I didn't think this tasted like KFC, but I did leave out the tomato soup mix.  Maybe that makes a big difference.  My HB did like the coating, but I didn't think it was too different from most seasoned flour mixes.  "
231054,17591,2005-12-27,4,I thought this soup was a little on the bland side.  I kept going back to review the ingredients.  I substituted l cup of beef broth for the water -- just using 1/2 cup of water.  I also added a few sprinkles of garlic powder and extra pepper.  When I served it I topped it with a little bit of Parmesan cheese.  The other reviews are all so great -- I'm still thinking I have made some sort of mistake.
52543,54634,2003-03-23,4,This was easy to make & a good side dish. I've made a similar dish with parsley flakes....which I will make next time. I felt there was enough sweetness without the basil.
321820,235195,2007-07-06,4,Very good peppers. We used ground turkey and tomato juice. I think they could have coked a little bit longer or next time I may partially cook the rice. The flavor was very nice.
317696,16015,2006-11-12,4,"These muffins taste really good.  However, I agree with Crazyboutcooking that they could use some extra cinnamon.  Also, I substituted half the oil for applesauce and I used wheat bran instead of oat bran.  I used paper muffin tin liners but I won't next time because the muffin stuck to the paper.  I also love how low in calories and fat these are!"
1483642,18110,2010-09-27,5,The whole family loved it!
1499332,137771,2010-01-01,4,Not bad and would definitly make it again but i found the chicken to be quite salty - would use the reduced sodium soya sauce next time.
2001846277,191830,2017-12-08,0,"The oven temp is 325 (If using glass dish, 350 for metal). I have been making this for 42 years and it is still a family favorite. Bake it for 1 hour then uncover for 15 to 25 minutes. Enjoy!!"
171790,375710,2009-06-16,5,Other than scaling the recipe down for only 2 eggs and adding freshly ground pepper I prepared this as written. What a wonderful flavour boost those fried onions give to the eggs! I loved this recipe. I'll be adding fried onions to my eggs from now on. Made for Went to the Market Tag.
493276,158634,2007-12-31,4,"We liked this! It was definitely good comfort food (I did not tell my fiance it was Weight Watchers) When I uncovered it I topped it with more cheese and some breadcrumbs. I also used one can of Cream of Chicken and only one cup of reduced fat milk, it was the perfect consistency. Thanks!!"
111306,141983,2014-06-16,5,True to the title of the recipe. Finally found the elusive great alfredo recipe to avoid paying the high price of going out to eat without sacrificing taste! Definitely a keeper!
107135,73732,2005-10-14,5, i liked  this alot  i also add chopped mushrooms   its simple  but very tasty thanks for posting dee
187373,19239,2010-01-03,5,"Perfect for the cinnamon rolls I made this morning! I used vanilla extract, skim milk and left out the salt. Used half recipe for one 13x9 pan of rolls. Thanks for posting!"
138047,121288,2005-08-01,5,"These biscuits were fabulous! My daughters thoroughly enjoyed rolling, cutting and eating the dough! We don't like nutmeg very much so I added  cinnamon instead. I halved the recipe but really wish I hadn't because we are already down to half a dozen biscuits. Those would have gone as well if it wasn't for the fact that I've had to hide some for DH to try when he comes home tonight!!"
498271,12295,2013-12-19,5,"What a lovely cookie recipe!  A little time-consuming to make but well worth it in taste and presentation.  I liked that the dough is not really sweet; it&#039;s a good balance with the sweet cherry and icing.  I did add some cocoa powder to my icing mix.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for the Sweet December holiday event, 2013"
1865690,133110,2011-04-26,5,"Sweet, tender and wonderful flavor. I used Jumbo (8-10 count) shrimp and butterfly them. Also used Panko, second time I made in 4 weeks.  Sauce was good, second time I omitted the rum and added honey and Dijon, in this pic is also the Pina Colada dip (i use cream coconut in lieu of pina colada mix).  Thank you, a keeper in this home."
126440,173691,2009-04-12,5,Excellent rolls.  I just finished breakfast and they were great. I did use butter not margarine and they turned out fine. I served them with Recipe #123467 and some fresh fruit.
60231,178311,2008-02-12,5,"We all really liked this.I love paprika and I substitute ground chicken for other meats in a lot of my cooking, so I knew I'd like it anyway. Happy that my family did too. Only substitute I made was to use green pepper instead of red - I just prefer it.
Thanks!"
241152,24988,2005-10-25,5,I reduced the chili sauce as another suggested and this pasta was wonderful.
223979,253601,2007-10-22,4,This is a really nice lunch.  Very quick and easy.  No need to change anything.  I will definitely make this again.
1445414,214007,2010-04-13,5,An absolutely wonderful stir fry. I added some candied ginger and a little more garlic because of personal preference. I omitted the sugar substitute completely. I also used a mix of fresh and frozen vegetables. I served it on brown whole grain rice and my family devoured it. I will definitely make this healthy meal for my family again.
6357,80765,2004-01-12,5,"These go very quickly in my house. I use 2/3 cup peanut butter and 6 tbsps. of cocoa powder. I also use margarine as a substitute for butter. I've made this recipe countless times and each time served it and shared it with so many people. Its really GRAND and so YUMMY, plus quick and easy to prepare! This is a favourite cookie always present on my holiday plate! "
351811,108492,2006-12-05,5,"OMG, my aunt Phyllis makes this cake. It is so simple to put together and tastes like a bread. In fact, I make this in loaf pans and slice it like bread served with a little honey butter on the side, yum, so delish! Nice to see it here on Zaar. 5 stars! ~V"
542403,262229,2007-12-24,4,used little bark too and it worked out great.  Big hit when we included it with the christmas cookies
1581225,9272,2017-02-07,5,"Amazing salsa! First time I've made salsa, and I was impressed. I'm glad it makes a lot because it was a lot of work, especially with peeling and chopping all those tomatoes. Better than store bought."
52427,26337,2002-09-28,5,"I agree with what some of the other reviewers said. This is hands down the BEST BBQ brisket I have ever tasted. It was so easy, I couldn't believe it. The meat was so tender, you could cut it with a fork. The sauce was a wonderful combination of sweet, tangy, and smoked flavor. Brilliant. Thanks Nurse Di, for another superb recipe."
220348,167579,2010-04-07,5,This was so delicious and good! It was nice and hearty and I enjoyed every bit of it.
112411,110843,2005-06-22,5,"I totally loved these! I tried to make them as healthy as possible by using all whole grain flours, no sugar and no oil...they were still awesome! I didn't have pecans, so I used walnuts; I also added some raisins. The sweet potato taste is hardly detectable (I even used more sweet potato than called for)."
228458,296259,2008-11-11,4,"This was a great spin on pizza and a nice break from the ""same old"". I omitted the olive oil as I didn't think the recipe needed it; all of the veggies had enough liquid in them to keep things from burning/sticking. I used 10 oz regular tomatoes and white mushrooms as they were already on hand, and a lot more garlic than called for. That said, we ended up sprinkling garlic powder over our slices at the table. I also used a combo of fresh mozzarella and sundried tomato feta, and it was really lovely. I think next time I might add a little cayenne for kicks. DH even liked this, and he's a dyed-in-the-wool carnivore. Thanks for posting! Oh, and I agree--this does NOT serve 6. DH and I ate all but about 1/8 of it in one sitting!"
356062,11272,2007-04-20,5,"I made these for lunch with left over Recipe #11377 from yesterday. Over all a very good version on egg foo yong. I scaled it down to make 2 really big patties. I couldnt get it to shape so I just put two batches in a small skillet. The sauce was alright, when I make this again I think I will try a diffrent sauce but the patties are a big 5 star! The next time I make these I think I'll try some diffrent veggies and tell you how it goes, thanks for posting this ones another winner!"
23302,48333,2003-01-29,5,"I went to my local butcher and told him I wanted Jimmy Dean. The butcher said, âHow many years have you been asleep? Jimmy Dean is six feet under, pushing up daisies.â I said, âNo, silly, I think Jimmy Dean might be some kind of sausage.â He said, âBest I can do is some of the sausage we make ourselves. If you like, I can label it âHank Williamsâ â heâs another dead country singer.â So I bought some Hank Williams. But I felt it would only be right to have some living people in the recipe, and so I mixed in a little bit of Charlie Chorizo and some Andy Andouille. I had to skip the seasoning salt for health reasons, and so I used a seasoning pepper mix and threw in a generous sprinkle of rubbed sage just for good measure, and I had to use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. What a delightful savoury quiche this was â I had previously only made âmainstreamâ quiches (Florentine, Lorraine, etc.) and it was wonderful to have a new and completely different taste. And what a no-brainer to prepare â just the ticket for a busy weeknight, and lots of extra tasty leftovers to have with a bowl of soup for lunch tomorrow."
469021,307293,2008-06-17,4,"We absolutely loved the flavor and texture of this dessert.  I used my ice cream maker and it was semi-frozen after 60 minutes and was ready to be eaten after another hour in the freezer.  We give this five stars for flavor!  I give it three stars for directions, though, because the use of the heavy cream is not specified and almond paste would probably work better than marzipan dough... I used marzipan dough (quite stiff) and mixed it with the cream and sugar; had to use a potato masher to break it apart and only then could I blend it before adding the other ingredients per the recipe; I also had to strain the mixture before using the ice cream maker to get the lumps of undissolved marzipan out of the mix.  After that, everything went as described.  The resulting dessert is fantastic!  Thanks so much for posting.  Made for ZWT4."
153401,83524,2004-09-28,5,This is the way I make my cabbage.  My husband refuses to eat it any other way.  I sometimes add chopped onions and a dash or 2 of Tony's.  
592481,284999,2010-08-23,4,"I boil for about 3 min.  When it's the correct ripeness, this should do just right for sweet, crisp ears.  Thank you for the simple post; good corn doesn't really need all the extras people like to pile on!  Oh, here's another tip: to prevent the kernels from drying out and shriveling, dump the corn in cold water or run it under the tap for 30 seconds immediately after removing from the pot."
242729,260952,2007-11-14,5,"This is THE one! Yes! This is the most authentic fondue I have made at home - and my French Swiss friends agreed with me too! FABULOUS - thanks so much! I made this absolutley to the last dot, and it was perfect. Do NOT think of leaving out the nutmeg, it is an essential ingredient in this recipe. As this was held for several friends, my photos were not good enough to post, as they consisted of (greedy)laughing faces and anxious hands with skewered baguette!!! BUT - I intend to do this for Malcolm and I one evening, now winter is here - so photos to follow! I made this in a Le Creuset Fondue set, it cooked to perfection! Merci beaucoup! FT:-)"
2002042906,397684,2018-03-10,4,"I grew up eating Hormel no-beans chili in a variety of ways, and have spent years searching for a from-scratch version of it. This came really close! The spices just need a little bit of tweaking. Less chili powder (this was wayyy spicier than canned Hormel chili), more salt, more garlic powder. Otherwise, the texture and color were exactly like the canned stuff!"
285298,81160,2006-01-19,4,I make this often for dinner. It is a major win over with the kids. Try it with chicken instead of ground beef. YUMMY!
2001015446,155637,2016-05-17,4,"I made these and they where very good. I found the mix a little on the dry side, so I added the juice from the orange. I also used the milk for the sesame seeds, and it helped a lot. This recipe is a keeper."
173579,222188,2013-02-04,5,Very nice frosting.  I had rave reviews from my family.  Thanks for posting.
2941544,315984,2013-08-12,5,"Very easy to make! I have been using this recipe for years, and it has become a family favorite. I found out that KFC uses the previous day&#039;s biscuits, so I always use day old buttermilk biscuits either from premade frozen dough or from scratch, depending on how much effort I feel like putting in that day. The flavor/texture of the pudding is very close to KFC&#039;s. Sometimes, I presoak some raisins in water for about an hour and add those into the mix as well. So yummy!!!"
58300,61747,2004-02-17,5,"Great recipe!!!!I had this with rice and it went along with the other recipes that I made.  It was like a smorgasbord of scallops and shrimp at my house.
Thank you so much!!!"
119466,108901,2007-03-18,5,"These were delicious! My husband loves chimichangas--he was in heaven. My son also commented about how good they were. I made them larger, using a heaping 1/2 cup of filling in each burrito-size tortilla, ending up with 8 chimis. (I froze 4 of them (unbaked) for later and will transfer them to the refrigerator the day before I plan to bake them.) I used 96% lean ground beef, and if I use the same next time, I may add a little salsa to the filling to moisten it up a bit. We really enjoyed these--thanks for posting!"
509707,82102,2007-06-13,5,"New to Recipe Zaar, this is just the second recipe I've tried (this week) and both of them were posted by Kittencal. There really are no superlatives in the English language to describe how delicious this chicken recipe is. My family members, who never let a dinner go by without suggesting an improvement, were left speechless in admiration! Thank you, Kittencal."
386380,179488,2006-11-17,5,I always rave about TGIF's Jack Daniel's steak. I tried this and it was really great! A little too much bourbon for me but I'm really glad you posted this! Hubby and I love it! Thanks!
679429,9055,2009-03-21,5,"Awesome recipe!  My husband, who doesn't like green beans told me he loved them this way!  I've been told it tastes like Boston Market's green beans!"
537188,166851,2008-04-19,5,Delicious!
500671,35410,2009-12-01,4,Yum!  I had to add some extra chocolate b/c I am a chocoholic.  :)
124416,356806,2009-02-22,4,"Nice!  I used bison, made as directed except for browning the meatballs.  I did them in the oven from start to finish, about 1/2 hour at 375.  I didn't have quite enough bacon and I think it would have been a little bit better if I had the full 6 slices.  And maybe a little salt and pepper.  Nice to make though.  I got 14 medium size beatballs from the 1 lb. of meat.  Thanks so much for posting . . . . . Janet"
200862,320598,2008-08-25,4,"Ground lamb is quite a novel inspiration, because it's not readily available -- I had to ask our local butcher to grind me some. We love lamb and I'll make ""lamb balls"" again! Kate, I made mine more like hamburger patties because I wanted it for our dinner. I added quite a bit of fresh thyme and also finely sliced mint. Your recipe brought back  memories -- my mother-in-law used to make sizable lamb meatballs, which she boiled in soup in winter, very comforting! My mother used to make small meatballs which she served with toothpicks and her own mustard sauce as a dip, for visitors. Thanks for this recipe!"
1305346,98273,2009-06-24,5,"This was awesome!!!! I used 1/2 cup sugar instead if 1 cup. And I used real stick butter. AMAZING! SO FUDGY, CHEWY, AND GREAT TASTE!!!! I WILL be making these again."
894666,22210,2016-03-18,5,"These were &quot;awesome&quot; according to all the kids in the house! I made 12 sliders, was worried they would be too spicy for young palates so used only a couple T of siracha for the chili sauce, skipped the tabasco, and used just over 1/4 cup of beer directly in the patties, skipped the basting while they cooked. Added 1/4 cup of panko bread crumbs to ensure the patties didn&#039;t fall apart, they were plenty hearty. I loved baking these in the oven, normally I do stovetop but oven was so convenient! After flipping patties, added a slice of sharp cheddar, served on  http://www.food.com/recipe/homemade-hamburger-buns-bread-machine-80413?photo=374957 homemade buns, and topped with caramelized onions. We were in heaven! I will keep nudging up siracha as I think we would have been fine using a bit closer to the called for amount. Thanks for what will be a new classic in this house!"
166642,204740,2007-01-25,5,"Green beans are my absolute favorite vegetable (lima beans a close second) and I adored this recipe! I usually add almonds when I fix green beans, but I just loved the pine nuts with them. These were so good that I could eat all eight servings by myself. Thanks for sharing, Annacia!"
1803684521,303440,2016-10-10,5,"WOW! I did not expect these to be that amazing but they are! Better than any full fat ginger bread cookies I've had. I used blackstrap molasses because I love the strong flavor, and they turned out perfect! I also used almond milk instead of orange juice, and it worked out great. I am so impressed. Thanks for this fabulous and EASY recipe!"
199848,147055,2009-11-29,5,"A wonderful use for the Thanksgiving leftovers!  This was great on lettuce and wrapped in lettuce-lined tortillas.  Just as quick to make as a sandwich, but not as boring.  Thanx for sharing!"
2000292491,437052,2015-06-28,0,very bad
79816,3470,2005-01-08,5,"My family loves this recipe. It's so easy to make, the chicken comes out tender, and the stuffing is very good. I used Stove Top Sourdough stuffing because I couldn't find pepperidge farm, and it worked just fine. "
42720,111459,2005-05-29,5,"I made this using recipe#111276 for my meatballs because I'm not a big fan of the store bought kind.  I just added a tablespoon of Italian seasoning to the meatball recipe to upgrade them from basic to Italian.  Other than that, I made no changes to this recipe.  It is very good and we just loved it.  It makes alot so I put some in a freezer container for a quick and easy meal later on.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  "
1179225,31717,2009-08-31,5,This was excellent! Loved by all. Looking forward to making this again. Thank you for posting!
769558,147326,2008-03-16,5,"Thank you for the tasty recipe!! The only change I made was accidentally using green curry paste instead of red! Still I'm not sure how much of a difference that made, since it was lovely. :) The tofu really soaked up the sauce well, which I hadn't found in other curry recipes I've tried! Definitely a nice change. ;)"
276156,130637,2008-02-04,5,This is an easy soup that turns out very creamy! Some broccoli cheese soups turn out to cheesy for my taste but this is a perfect combination of broccoli and cheese. Thanks for posting!
156008,91269,2004-12-21,4,"This is a delicious recipe, and easy to make.  I used 2 Tablespoons of Vanilla extract, I'll try Anise next time.  I added an additional 3/4 to 1 cup (or so) of flour to make the ""soft dough"".  The most difficult part is mastering the iron (which isn't hard) - I only cooked mine for about 30 seconds (not 1 minute).  Let them cool before stacking, or they'll be soft, not crisp.  I stored mine in plastic bags.  They're terrific!  "
199848,176319,2006-07-24,5,This a terrific (and easy) new way to enjoy corn.  I sed frozen corn and cut way down on the salt.  We all loved it!  Thanx for this; it's a repeater!
28636,319601,2009-12-28,5,"We haven't been to Casa Ole but we can certainly enjoy amazing food when we taste it!   DH declared this to be ""off the charts good"" and I agree.  We enjoyed it on tostadas made with Recipe#199148 and also as a dip for veggies and tortilla chips.  We'll certainly keep this recipe handy for famiy dinners and parties.  Thanks Chief Teer!"
1999264,133718,2011-09-04,5,"The basic steps and ingredients were very clear. For someone who has experience and can improvise, this was fabulous. I'll save the recipe for the next time the fishmonger gifts me with fresh cod!"
171790,51803,2009-02-19,5,I love soup and this one is no exception. It's delicious. For the soup mix I used recipe#4718 and for the meat I used 2 ham hocks. I followed the recipe as written except that the soup mix didn't have a flavour package to add. It took about 3 hours of cooking before all the beans were tender. Made for Healthy Choices Tag.
2932795,53133,2013-08-06,5,"Moist, succulent pork tenderloins...from the meat drawer to the table in less than 30 minutes!  Coupled with an amazing cranberry balsamic reduction.  There&#039;s a reason this recipe keeps on ticking ten years after its introduction on Food.com.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In my case, this was my first attempt tonight and I couldn&#039;t be happier.  I had over two and a half pounds of tenderloin and ended up quadrupling the sauce components with no problems...just use your big boy skillet on a high heat and allow 5-10 minutes more to reduce the two cups of broth etc.  Oh, I like pineapple with cranberries, so I added a cup of the fresh fruit to the recipe.  I hope you enjoy it."
177753,8701,2006-12-27,5,"I was a little scared to try making these because I've never made ribs before, but these turned out great! I ended up using spare ribs because they didn't have baby backs at the store I go to. I cooked them for about a half hour longer than stated, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. My husband loved them! I only used half of the ribs I bought when I cooked them in the oven so the next day I put the left overs in a crockpot for my husband to take to work. He actually said that he liked the ones cooked in the oven better which surprised me! UPDATE: I made these again the other night when my family came over but I used baby backs this time and cooked them for 3 hours at 300. My dad was raving about them the whole time and said they were the best he's ever had. He usually doesn't get too excited about things but he literally made a comment about how amazing they were after each rib! I can't believe it but these were 10x better the second time around!"
527607,242479,2007-09-24,5,"ohhh delicious. addicting.

Since some said they had trouble caramelizing, i used splenda brown sugar blend since brown sugar caramelizes fast. Was done in minutes, so easy and so great."
1591517,134437,2012-02-05,5,Very good and gives that chicken fantastic flavor.
41218,94441,2005-10-03,4,"Enjoyable...the crunch from celery and almonds allows you to savor the flavors with each chew. It's so simple to make, don't let the ingredients scare you off! I recommend the reduced fat soup and sour cream...I used regular and it was very rich! This is a great recipe for holidays, buffets, covered dish dinners and so on. Thanks Heather Feather!"
552613,253026,2008-04-06,4,This was really quick and pretty healthy.  We enjoyed them over top of some baked potatoes and it made for a really tasty and easy meal.  I was happy to see the turkey bacon in the recipe and it worked well.  The only reason I am giving four instead of five stars is that my partner commented that they were ever so slightly too sweet but I thought they were fine.  That was probably down to the brand of BBQ sauce rather than the recipe.  Made for PAC Spring 2008.
470211,45940,2008-04-12,5,"This is a keeper.  Easy and tastes great.  Next time I might double gravy, just cause we prefer more!!  Served over rice.  Thanks"
131126,208822,2011-06-04,5,"I enjoyed this and it went together easily.  I used fresh veggies, adding slivers of red bell pepper,  & used Knorr alfredo mix.  Served with a grenn salad it made a filling meal.  Thanks for sharing the recipe! Made for ZWT7."
844554,120051,2009-10-14,5,"This hit the spot for us. Had it with Recipe #89202 for a low carb dinner. Followed exactly, except cut the recipe in half. Thanks for posting. Made for Bargain Basement 2009"
1328758,29846,2012-01-12,5,"Wow, this is really good! No anchovies or eggs and the flavor is fantastic- bravo! And low-cal on top of it. Five stars for sure!"
25941,136589,2007-11-26,5,"WOW is this great.  Absolutely the best, even better than my recipe I have to admit.  Thanks for a new apple cake recipe that will be a standard in our home."
46104,335539,2009-01-20,4,"These were a huge hit with my bf.  I thought the texture was a little more like a brownie than a muffin.  However, that did not phase my bf; he gobbled up three when he got home from work.  I think next time I may double the jam for a little more fruit flavor.  Thanks for a recipe my bf will be begging for again!"
949568,118475,2010-11-07,4,"Really good soup and filling, but not quite the stuffed cabbage taste I was looking for.  The kids all added cheese (my daughter said she might try it on top of hot dogs next).  Does make a lot which is great with this family of adult kids who can eat a lot!  Thanks Littleturtle!"
274563,12295,2005-12-18,5,"I love this recipe, we've made it in my family every year at Christmas.  We do use 3/4 cup confectionate sugar in our family as we got the recipe from another cookbook, the rest is exactly the same.  I suspect it simply makes the dough a little sweeter.  Add cocoa to the icing to get chocolate."
82381,103606,2006-02-27,5,absolutely delicious and healthy too.  I am sipping it at this very moment and it's so good.  This would make a great meal for babies and small children.  Thank you so much.  From now on my chicken soup will include all these delicious root veggies.
1496272,56232,2010-06-01,5,I loved that this was SO simple and SO good :) I would mention that the longer it has chilled the better it tastes.  My husband and I both enjoyed it very much! Thanks for posting :)
478309,64448,2008-11-14,5,"This was absolutely wonderful!  I used 1 brown gravy mix and 1 mix of onion soup mix because I only had 4 cube steaks but followed the rest of the recipe.  My husband and mother in law both loved it!  The leftovers were even better and I of course got them, because I found the recipe! :)  Thanks a bunch for sharing!"
50151,16716,2008-10-04,5,Buckeyes are so yummy and these tasted exactly as I remembered!!  Soooo good!!!
953790,78088,2009-01-22,5,I too used this for the Yummy Crunch Caramel Apple Pie #31128 and it was awesome.  This sauce thickens as it cools and is heavenly. This will be the only caramel sauce recipe I ever use.  Thanks for sharing.
152067,147444,2006-01-08,5,"The girls in the office asked if I would make this as soon as the magazine arrived. I did. One girl requested one to serve her family during Christmas. The boss wants one for a birthday cake this week.So I will be making my third one in less than a month. Be prepared its ""sinfully"" rich!! "
763908,107543,2008-12-03,5,I first tried this recipe from The Taste of Home magazine and they're on my cookie trays every year. They are INCREDIBLE.
13483,110743,2006-05-26,5,"I kind of followed the recipe.  I used real garlic and onion, threw in some broccoli and walnuts and called it dinner.  The sauce was excellent.  It was great over my rice!!  Thanks SmHerndon"
512309,282939,2008-02-22,4,"4 stars 
This was easy and delicious, a perfect dinner for a busy night. I used minced garlic instead of powder, and bow-tie pasta instead of linguine, but overall I think the recipe came out probably as it was intended. The only thing I might change next time is the method of melting the cheeses in the milk Ã¢â¬â I might start it as a roux first, then add milk, then add cheese, just to help keep it from separating. 
This pasta was mild enough to please my children, and the flavors were complex enough to please the adults too. Pour yourself a nice glass of wine with this, toss a green salad, and enjoy a fabulous dinner."
1506604,42169,2010-06-19,5,"YUMM!!! So easy and without frying. Don't need as much breadcrumbs and parmesan as directed. I sifted some of the parmesan from the breadcrumb mixture and sprinkle it on my shrimp before putting it in the oven. I will be making these again really soon. Also, using larger shrimp is the best way to go with this recipe."
47510,275681,2008-04-16,5,These potatoes were easy to make and had a wonderful flavor.  Made for PAC Spring 2008
58075,263633,2009-11-30,0,"I never saw the SL article, but I've made similiar cookies like this since I was in Jr. High.  I always used peanut butter cookies with the mini pretzels, chocolate chip eyes and m&m nose."
2352596,178146,2014-08-19,5,"These lettuce wraps are great and one of the best ways to get my nieces and nephews to eat some veggies. I leave out the chillis and bamboo shoots and increase thr cooking sauce by about a quarter. I used the ingredients in the comments by the PF Changs employees to make a dipping sauce. Its a little different everytime because I dont measure-I just add stuff to taste but its always good. The only other thing I do is finely shread some fresh carrots to spinkle on top because we like the taste they add. I&#039;ve made them with finely diced chicken breast as well a with ground chicken. They&#039;re fun for the kids because they get to help make the sauce and they love building their own wraps. Getting all of the ingedients for the sauce and marinade was a bit of an investment initially but we make these once or twice a month. And if you like stir fry the sauce ingredients are great to have on hand. Thanks for this one, BamaKathy."
234656,15411,2006-10-08,4,"These are great with the addition of 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  Try them spread with strawberry jam while they're still warm!
EDIT: The first time I made these, I used natural peanut butter (only peanuts + salt).  I made them again with Jiff, and I didn't like them at all - they were WAY too sweet, with a strange texture.  So I would definately recommend natural peanut butter in this recipe."
422544,166579,2007-02-07,5,"Wow! These were wonderful. I made them vegan with tofutti sour cream, veg butter, veg bouillon and Follow Your Heart vegan mozzarella cheese.  We were stunned at how tasty they were.   Definitely a salty (yet very flavorful) sauce, I added extra sr cream.  Will be making again for sure!"
107583,220438,2010-01-24,5,"One of the most flavorful, juicy pork loins I have ever had!  Cooking times were right on.  Made as written except for brand of hard cider, and used Calvados for the deglazing, since I couldn't find the pommeau de normandie.  Made for Winter 2010 Comfort Cafe game."
1011115,191225,2010-09-05,5,"These were so good! I made hearts out of mine, just formed the dough with my fingers before placing it on the cookie sheet. A side note, I will make them a little smaller next time! When I put them on the cookie sheet I thought they would be the size i wanted (small) but the dough spreads out a good amount!!! These were still so simple and very yummy!"
1800054678,64061,2015-08-06,5,"First time making jam at home. I don&#039;t have a water canner, so I watched a video on YouTube about how to can without a canner. With the video and this recipe, it gave me enough info and confidence to pull this off on the first try. The blueberry jam tasted so good. Next time, I am going to double the recipe and make more!"
380897,331161,2010-02-19,5,the best tasting fish soup ever cant top this delicious flavors
50509,349738,2009-07-20,4,"A good sandwich bread - slightly denser, with flavors that work well with sandwich fillings. Because Canadian all-purpose flour is higher protein than is flour in the US, I used bread flour, but also subbed some whole wheat white in for some of the regular flour. I used my bread machine, adding all of the ingredients except the sun-dried tomatoes at the beginning. The caramelized onions contributed a brown color to the bread, The zucchini and carrot are not discernable, but contributed a moist texture. I added the tomatoes towards the end of the cycle, so they are visible. I shaped part as rolls and part as a loaf for a bake sale."
775207,167202,2010-05-07,5,"The family loved it but I must admit we made some changes. We don't buy mixed frozen veggies, but used a combination of fresh veggies and frozen peas & corn. The other change was using puff pastry as the topping. I was easy and very filling!"
242729,235270,2007-06-24,5,"A real winner of a cake! I made this in a loaf tin and sprinkled the slices with vanilla icing sugar to serve. I adore almonds, and this cake was VERY almondy! I did NOT add the cinnamon, but added a little extra of the almond extract and about 1/2 cup of ground almonds - only because I had some left in an opened bag! Would make a very good dessert pudding cake - served warm. Made for ZWT3 - thanks for posting Rezika! FT:-)"
632249,114638,2009-09-14,5,"Oh my heavens, these cookies are divine! I just adore coconut so I knew this was going to be good.  I had to make a change to butter as I did not have shortening and I used only 1 1/2 C chocolate chips since that was all I had left.  I think using butter caused the cookies to spread more than shortening would have but that was still okay. Also, I think the 1 1/2 C choc chips is about right for us too.  I can't wait to see my kid's eyes pop out of their heads tonight when they see how big these are! Awesome cookies Roxy, thanks for posting!"
411647,264246,2009-11-27,5,This was a huge hit for our Thanksgiving dinner.  The apples came through wonderfully.  I didn't find any sage sausage so just used an italian mild sausage.  And my  stuffing mix was only 12oz but it did the job.  Very flavorful and satisfying!!
222564,23367,2006-04-28,5,"WOW!!! Very good for any asian salad! I did not dilute my dressing with the water and we prefered it that way. Will use a lot, yum!!!"
496594,209076,2009-08-18,5,"This makes a lovely bread and to be honest, I thought it was even better the next day. (Makes a delicious  sandwich with good ol' scrambled eggs, by the way!) Didn't have Mixed Herbs, so used Italian Herbs as a sub. Made the dough in the bread machine and then popped it in the oven at 175ÃÂ°C for 40 minutes."
2000715946,252897,2015-11-27,0,excellent soup   made it many times!!!!!!
24386,17764,2003-11-28,5,"I was so excited when I saw this recipe.  I know the restaurant rolls that you are referring to and they are so good.  I made a lot of rolls, so I used 4 tablespoons of margarine and 4 teaspoons of honey.  The rolls were very sticky and almost had too strong a honey flavor.  I will use this again and cut back on the honey.  Great idea Heatherfeather!"
750003,163079,2010-06-27,5,The original recipe is awesome!  I can't help but add chopped bacon to mine.  Also made once subbing chopped cilantro instead of dill (didn't have any) and was a nice variation.
326084,166878,2006-06-29,5,"Mmm-Mmm Good!  I substituted all the white sugar for Splenda and used half brown sugar/half Splenda brown sugar.  I also used 1 1/4 wheat flour and 1 cup white.  Next time I think I will try all wheat and more Splenda brown sugar.  They were delicious and soft.  My problem is I can't stop eating them! Don't be afraid to substitute-they didn't taste ""healthy""!"
121193,85127,2004-05-09,5,I thought this was great!  Very tasty.  I'd make it again.
1535,187151,2009-10-16,5,"I have fallen in love with roasted carrots, and this was an excellent version. I was baking something else at the same time, so I roasted them at 350ÃÂ°F for about 60 minutes. Delicious!"
1589782,112454,2010-04-01,5,"GOL DANG!!!!! I made this for my boyfriend tonight and it was the best scrumdelish thing we'd ever gol dang eaten! AND HE KNOWS HOW TO EAT, he's from Nebraska.  His dad has a hankerin to try it so i reckon next time I go visit we'll make it for him."
189191,94861,2007-12-15,4,"I stumbled on frozen frog legs in the new grocery store in town and bought them on an impulse. My hubby and I were very excited to make them. They were ""finger lickin' good"". Any chance these could be baked? I'm always try to keep things light if I can. I will definately make these again."
199848,410273,2010-12-25,5,"Creamy and tasty.  What a nice, easy way to leftover chicken or turkey.  This reminds me of a hot chicken salad.  I didn't have any pimientos, but that's the only thing I left out.  I will use them next time for the splash of color and flavor.  I might throw a little cheese in next time as well.  Thanx for sharing this!"
2666083,164369,2013-01-29,0,"I cannot give this recipe any stars at all! it states to prepare the pudding as usual and when I did this, everything turned to runny mush! My suggestion is do not use any milk!"
43083,138528,2006-08-22,4,I made this tonight and really enjoyed it. I omitted the carrots but that is it. I also ate it immediately! (I do that with the Suddenly Salad too:)
2000929091,426872,2016-03-20,5,"Delicious!! I don&#039;t do reviews, but had to about this recipe. I substituted 1/2 plain greek yogurt &amp; 1/2 sour cream. I didn&#039;t do the glaze, since we couldn&#039;t stop eating the cake long enough to make it."
62264,201716,2007-07-02,5,"Moi Caliente! These boogers are great! I opted for the cheddar cheese add-in & also added 1/4 finely diced Valdalia onion. I used 8 oz. cream cheese block & added in pineapple tidbits to taste. I smooshed them & liked the wee little chunks better than going for crushed pineapple.
I cleaned the jalapenos a couple of days before putting it all together - stored them in a ziplock bag - they maintained their crispness in fridge w/o problems. I slit them from stem to stern on one side with the stems sitting up (great serving handles for the stuffed pepper). They required just under 40 mintes at 350 when cut & filled in this manner. The ones I did not get most of the pith out at the stem end out were HOT HOT HOT! Made for a fun sort of ""Russian Roulette"" appetizer - LOL! Will definately be making these again & again -just beware of getting the membrane which holds the seeds as well as the seeds unless you really want to risk being burned twice! ;) Thanks Cookingfor7, for this great fun appetizer with just the right balance of sweet, salty, smoky, unctuous & hot!"
1086570,206730,2009-04-24,3,a good m and c but not great. It was easy to make and pretty tasty but it did not knock my socks off. To be fair I used yellow vermont cheddar instead of white cheddar. So this could have made of difference.
1157750,22176,2010-03-24,5,I made this with whole wheat rotini and it was amazing. My kids loved it.
430471,134347,2007-06-26,5,I've always wondered what type of vegetable to serve with tacos and this fit the bill wonderfully.  The corn and squash married well.  I used fresh squash out of my garden.  I had to use canned corn but I will definately make again with fresh corn.
1803581314,236642,2015-06-10,1,"I don&#039;t know yet what the end result will be, but definitely it&#039;s not as simple as the recipe claims.
I used frozen strawberries and the indicated amount of sugar, bur 1/4 cup of water didn&#039;t quite do it. I added 1/4 C more and still it doesn&#039;t even remotely look like a smooth pure... It is clumps of frozen sugar-coated strawberries.
I will put in the freezer nonetheless because it makes no sense to waste 1 qt strawberries... But I feel like some extra input is missing from the recipe."
46104,120568,2010-04-26,0,"These were very good. I probably used more cheese than called for because I love cheese (used a mix of sharp cheddar and jack).  I didn't have a problem with the amount of spinach mixture because we folded in the sides then rolled the tortillas (real burrito style my bf informed me). The only thing I would do differently is mix salsa, cheese and spinach and then fill tortillas.  Some bites were all cheese and others were all spinach. Thanks for a really easy and yummy weeknight recipe."
2206637,162902,2012-11-24,5,"Oh Rita, again with the great recipe!  Thanks soooo much!  I was looking for a turkey pot pie, saw your name and knew this was the one.  The only thing I did different was minced a jalapeno pepper in with the onion and garlic.  The seasoning was spot on!"
400817,42656,2010-05-24,5,"I added 1/4 cu pine nuts. Love it! This is a summer favorite of ours. I served it over pan-seared summer squash, and pasta."
120121,113094,2009-03-12,3,"I'm sorry to say that my experience was much like Abby Girl's.  I used plenty of asiago (probably more than called for), but it didn't melt beautifully like in Gayla's pic.  It got stringy, and you could barely even taste it.  I'm thinking this must be a matter of technique somehow.  I promise to experiment further and review again if I get the bottom of the problem."
37909,41286,2005-01-01,5,This has become one of my family favorites.  It is very good and easy to make.  I made a few changes - I put 1 cup of white wine and used low sodium chicken broth.  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream.  Jarlsberg cheese makes a nice garnish.
2001829380,195547,2017-11-28,0,Does anyone know where I can get the cookbook &quot;cooking with clogs &quot; ?
567714,311400,2008-07-08,4,"Tasty, light ,refreshing,and filling!I added beansprouts , green onion and a little salt to mine. Thanks!"
122001,61621,2006-03-24,5,"This was great exactly what I had in mind for dinner.  I made 2 adjusments from the original.  First I cut it in half, because there are only 2 of us.  Second I added a can of french styly green beans.  It came out perfect.  "
565828,154139,2007-10-21,5,"Another wonderful meal that is so quick and so easy and so tasty!
Will be making this again and maybe I'll try this with porkchops!

Thanks for the great recipe!"
357071,351979,2012-12-13,5,"This was so good!! I am NOT a rice fan., but I am now! I added fresh mushroom also to this. That was the only thing different I did. Thanks"
357723,137253,2008-01-10,1,I'm afraid these were way too over the top sweet for us. I have 5 kids and they just ended up sitting in the pan. I couldnt distinguish the individual flavors it just married into one big spoon full of sugar.
327600,113998,2006-07-21,5,"I usually put in a little less sugar and a few more tea bags nowadays, but this is my original formula as well -- again, probably from the same source!!"
115321,24609,2005-03-23,5,"So good! I followed the directions exactly, stirring in the powdered sugar one cup at a time in the saucepan. It's smooth, creamy, and chocolately. Thanks for a great recipe."
313014,237468,2010-03-30,4,Good and easy to put together! Thanks for posting!
628753,81635,2007-12-28,5,Tonight this will be our 2nd time making your recipe. I thought I lost the link. We really enjoyed the first time. Looking forward to tonight and will bring our chilled cakes to my inlaws tomorrow. Thanks
55052,26306,2005-10-09,5,"I love corn, but my husband only likes it if it's Niblets.  I tried this recipe as a money saver, and got a suprise!  He likes it even better.  Altogether a tasty recipe."
54678,97531,2011-10-02,5,"A very easy dish to prepare - I used a small Jamaiican pepper and one Chipotle - wow, was it hot. So I was very surprised when it disappeared so fast. Co-workers, family and friends really liked it. I also used combo of cilantro and basil. I enjoy growing the tomatillo plant for its unique papery husks. Well I believe I make this every year but only have my notes for this year 2011 batch so for the record used the habanero and 2 chipotles in adobo and 1 cup fresh cilantro and boy it was burning but everyone loves it!!"
1856659,112096,2011-06-27,2,"I decided to make these because of all the great reviews I read. Me and my mother thought they tasted very bland, they were bearable to me but my mom threw hers away. Maybe we are not used to Belgian waffles with yeast as she said they tasted too much like bread to her. Next time I will try a recipe w/o yeast. But I must say, they were crispy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside, just not a good flavor."
461724,252966,2008-02-07,3,These were ok.  The dough was the stiffest cookie dough I've ever worked with.  My poor mixer was straining somewhat to mix it up!  They were good enough to satisfy my sweet tooth; just don't know if I'll make again though.
6357,69170,2003-09-17,5,"What a wonderful bread you have here, Dale! This has not one single spoon of fat going into making it and YET, it came out SOOOOOOO GOOD! I wish I could give you many many more stars and thanks for this bread. This is really amazing. While I was making the batter ready for this bread, I realised that I had run out of baking soda. So, I used 1/4 tsp. of baking powder instead of it, in addition to the baking powder called for. I went hunting for All-Bran cereal just to try this recipe, but when I couldn't get that, I bought a packet of Kellogg's Fruit n Fibre cereal. I used this instead of the all bran cereal. This bread took exactly 35 minutes to bake in my AMC Dutch Oven. I enjoyed this on its own, served right out of the AMC Oven. Right now, I have a whole team of plumbers who are fixing a new bath tub in my bathroom, and they munched on this, and said, they wanted all of it! LOL:-)
Thank you very much for sharing an INCREDIBLY GOOD recipe!!!"
146310,149734,2007-03-25,5,These went fast here! For sure a keeper!
106624,3094,2007-12-12,5,"These are fast easy and roll out thin very well.  Grandson of four rolled and cut perfectly,  we had to make all cars though, which had to be decorated with pink royal icing.  Perfect Christmas tray cookie."
632249,190235,2012-01-14,5,We really enjoyed the bacon and almonds with the green beans.  I used fresh onion as opposed to the instant onion and I used reduced sodium bouillon. An excellent side dish that I will make again. I would really like to try this with fresh green beans when they are in season as they're a bit pricey right now.  Thx Beth.
723614,22782,2008-01-11,5,"I made this last night and everyone loved it!  This is a keeper, we will never by the premade stuff again!"
2001938368,56776,2018-01-18,3,"First couple bites were very good, then got annoying. Sauce is super thin and the chicken breasts maybe should have been seared first or something. Needs more flavor depth......."
21752,54167,2003-07-28,5,"Somersizer alert -- this is perfect for those of us Somersizing, just leave off the olives!  I chose this recipe as part of the Pick Your Chef July 2003 game, and I'm so glad I did.  I had this for breakfast and then took some in to work for lunch (travels well in Tupperware).  I used some feta cheese that was laced through with za'atar and oregano.  Very very yummy!  Thanks, Kari, this one is great!"
51109,264190,2008-11-04,5,"I made a huge roaster of these for my daughter's and son-in-law's post-wedding party!  They were one of three hot sandwich options and were cleaned out before the other two (very tasty) offerings.  I used about 20 hot dogs for the same amount of sauce, and a bunch more onion.  Also offered more cheese."
494084,174947,2008-05-31,4,This was my first tast of Quinoa and I thought I might be grossed out but it was quite good!  I loved the tartness of the cherries and the crunch of the almonds.  This was good as is but I also might try all the ingredients minus the quinoa over salad greens next time.  Thanks for ther recipe Annisette
182358,106633,2006-03-05,5,"These were so delicious and  very easy.  I was making them for dinner when the kids stopped by and they had to sample them.  Everyone loved 'em and I'll definitely be making them again.  I prefer using fresh ingredients rather than frozen products...  and I love that the peel isn't removed.... very tasty!  Perfect combination of spices, too!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
269331,46726,2007-12-26,5,"Wow these where good.  I had just a bit over a half a cup of bourbon left in the bottle and didnÃ¢â¬â¢t want to waste it, so I added the whole thing.  Can I say WOW again?  Hey whatÃ¢â¬â¢s the use of a bourbon ball if you canÃ¢â¬â¢t taste the bourbon? :-)  THX."
2258073,175230,2012-05-14,5,great recipe. Thanks so much. My people and I loved it!
427535,85463,2008-09-04,5,"This sauce is just amazing.  You can dip anything in it and it will taste good. I had been looking for such a dipping sauce to match other sauces that I have had at restaurants and this is it.
Who knew that such simple ingredients would taste so so good.  I will make this many many times in the future. Even my kids liked it."
1253164,21221,2010-01-21,5,"I reduced this recipe down to 1c (serves 3-4), used the juice of one 20oz can of pineapple (a little over 3/4c) and added an extra 1/4c brown sugar for a sweet, though not overpowering, sauce.  Also, as I was using this for a stir-fry, I added 1tbls cornstarch to thicken it up just a bit, though I would use up to 2tbls, depending on the application.  Overall, a very good sauce and a simple preparation."
2001024905,29704,2016-05-25,0,"These were really good! Personally, I like my fries crispy so after about baking them for 30 minutes, I broiled them as well for about 5 minutes."
703014,286990,2008-09-20,5,What a very clever name - I love it! I took a hint from SweetsLady and only made half the filling and I still had leftover filling. These cooked up perfectly in 11 minutes for me and they tasted really good but had just a bit too much cream cheese for my taste. I'll make these again with 1/2 lb. sausage and 2 ounces of cream cheese next time and bet they will be perfect for me. Thanks so much for sharing!
61569,312584,2010-03-02,5,Here is another excellent garam masala recipe that has a balanced flavor but different in addition of caraway seeds.  Thank you Tigerlillyblu for posting this recipe.  Made for Asian Forum's India Tag Game Mar 2010.
274977,216133,2009-08-11,5,"These were delicious!!  My friends and I have an anual girl
s weekend at the our cottage and we pretty much eat snacks all weekend long.  These were a big hit and so easy to do."
1415433,89204,2011-03-24,5,my friend has a recipe similar except bakes at 350 for about 1.25 hours.  Add cilantro and sour cream to dish when plated.  Can omit the cream cheese too.  Last time i made with strips of chicken breast and put on bottom of casserole dish and added the rest on top.
52282,61792,2003-05-28,5,"i have made similar recipes, the coconut milk, sambal olek, fish sauce and lime are the standard ingredients but the pineapple is a nice addition, adds a hint of sweetness. i only used a pinch of sugar and found that to be enough. nice easy dinner"
1329897,64356,2009-07-20,5,"Loved it, but next time I'm going to try chicken broth instead of 2/3 cup butter as was suggested in another review."
988458,27085,2009-10-05,4,Good recipe...a suggestion to avoid a doughy crust.  Prebake the crust a bit before topping with the remaining ingredients.  That should do the trick!
840025,8739,2015-02-08,0,Best I ever made - so good!
472394,52999,2008-10-12,5,These are great!  We haven't made regular flour pancakes since I tried this recipe months ago.  I add a little vanilla and cinnamon to taste.  Thanks for sharing!
220348,101803,2006-10-16,4,"This was really good and delicious. I made this for a family dinner, and was enjoyed by all."
204024,111849,2009-07-30,5,Made these for an afternoon snack for my DD & DS.   They really liked these.  They didn't think it tasted enough like coffee so would increase the coffee next time. Made for Summer Comfort Cafe.
251533,190139,2007-07-27,5,Excellent!
124249,29693,2005-01-24,4,"This salad was very flavorful and fruity. Easy to make. 

Thanks LDJ"
171920,39160,2007-01-07,3,"This cake was good.  I used butter flavored Crisco, but will try butter next time."
482376,484315,2012-08-11,5,"Excellent! I can see why this is one of your favorites. The flavors are wonderful together. I ended up roasting the veggies instead of bbq-ing, because I don't have a grill plate/basket. I reallyyyyyy need to get one of those. This combination of veggies worked wonderfully well in the oven though! Made for ZWT8 Australia/NZ"
182010,224355,2007-06-05,5,What a brilliant use of extra egg whites and fresh rasberries!  The brown sugar really makes a difference in the flavor of the meringue.  We used fresh mint leaves as a substitute for the geranium leaves.
2000838092,26555,2018-02-22,0,I cut back a little on the powdered sugar and the buckeyes was too soft or turned soft so quickly it was hard to dip into chocolate. Is too little powdered sugar the cause of it being soft?
61660,297272,2008-12-06,5,"This is a great spice mixture!  It smells fantastic too, lol.  I used it to rim the glass of my hot cocoa.  Added a touch more sweetness but the spice flavors were fantastic with the chocolate."
41809,91344,2005-01-04,5,"OMG, is this good chewin'! We no longer have a barbie, so I made creole seasoning with Mizz Annie's recipe #22089, rolled that hummer around and around in the rub, stuck it in a cooking bag, and put it to roast in the oven, about 325Â° for approximately 3 hours. Talk about moist and tender! I didn't use beer or chicken stock ... The juices from the meat oozed out, and I got a pretty tasty gravy from them! Oh, I did add a 1/2 tspn. of cayenne to the seasoning mix. Gave the pork a nice little bite!
Wonderful recipe, Speedy! I do believe she's a keeper! Laudee"
120448,186029,2009-11-15,5,"Our Publix market had a frozen, 1 pound fresh Vegetable Gumbo mix that called for Cajun Seasoning, a can of stewed tomatoes and optional Andouille Sausage, I used aidells.  The seasoning made this gumbo excellent.  I used 1/2 of the cayenne suggested and about 1/2 of the salt.  We thought we were back in New Orleans"
906665,51888,2013-03-10,4,"This was a great chicken. I only used 1 tbsp salt and used it for the skin as well as inside the bird. I greased my roasting pan, cut an onion into 8 pieces and put the chicken on top of that (I don't have a small rack for chicken). I also placed some cut up potatoes and about 10 garlic cloves around the chicken. During the last 20 min, I added some baby carrots. What a beautiful dish! After 1 hour, the chicken wasn't quite cooked through or browned enough (maybe an additional 20-30 minutes would be necessary?) but there were lots of delicious juices. I didn't taste much lemon, so I think I would place some lemon slices on top of the chicken next time. I look forward to making this again! The bones are now in the slow cooker, on their way to making chicken stock!"
39301,29413,2005-05-30,5,"Fantastic!  I've used this recipe time and again when I want to impress with a simple yet elegant dessert/treat.  The chocolate sauce is divine and these are always the first thing to disappear when we have company.  I follow the recipe just ""as is."" No modifications necessary."
60989,62205,2003-05-28,5,I have had this at a restaurant before. It is an incredible mix of flavors! Try it! 
651269,111299,2009-08-02,0,Great easy recipe.  We didn't use the nuts and it is more like a dip for us.  Can't wait to take to work for next party.
266635,507748,2013-11-05,5,"Sooo delicious and sooo easy to make -- a great holiday dessert for sure.  But, since canned pumpkin is available all year round, don&#039;t wait for the holidays.  This cheesecake turned out perfectly and the whipped cream is a big bonus -- made mine from scratch.  Will definitely make this dessert again for Thanksgiving as I know it will be a hit.  Made for PRMR, November, 2013."
751979,83192,2010-04-26,3,"I thought mine turned out alittle dry and was rather average for me. Used only dark meat (boneless chicken thighs) for easy shredding later, upped the amt of cinnamon powder, reduced the egg component and still found it abit too ""eggy"" for me. Thought the egg taste overpowered the shredded chicken.The almond crunchy bits was a nice touch (couldnt help munching on it after dry frying them with 1 tbsp of sugar and cinnamon) but it somehow still didnt quite taste like the bastillas I had in Marrakesh. Still dreaming and craving for that heavenly pastry... Too bad it's pretty hard to find a good restaurant serving bastilla in this part of Asia. Was pretty fun putting the recipe together though."
2602045,454725,2017-03-22,5,"When I saw this on the BL,,, I JUST HAD TO MAKE IT!! IT TURNED OUT FABULOUSLY DELICIOUS AND SO BEAUTIFUL!! I've made it MANY TIMES since!!"
866963,318659,2009-12-12,5,My daughter chose these to take for an end of semester party and everyone enjoyed them. I sprinkled pecans on top of half the pan rather than mixing nuts in the batter so that it was easier to make some with and some without nuts.
167236,127230,2007-01-08,4,"Outstanding recipe, easy to make and better than any restaurant version I've had ... For those using the nutritional analysis, it is incorrect -- the software assumes that the entire 1 quart of vegetable oil is consumed in this recipe, hence the outrageous figures (2034 calories, 218 g fat per serving, etc.). In fact, the amount of oil used/consumed is more like 3 Tbsp, so the per serving figures should be about 100 calories/serving and 4 g total fat. Tastes great and you can feel good about eating it!!"
357723,12572,2007-03-25,5,"These were fabulous. I made them exactly as directed and doubled the recipe. The only thing different is that I added garlic. VERY delicious, easy to make. Thank you Lali!"
196296,93190,2006-03-01,5,"This was fantastic and super easy.  I added garlic to the marinade (just cuz I love it!) and had to triple the amount of wasabi powder in the mayo, but maybe mine had lost some of its potency?  I just kept adding bit by bit, and tasting til it had some kick... Anyway, it was very yummy and my dh and I both loved it.  Great salmon recipe!  OH, I served it with sauteed red peppers (until they were very mushy) and they went really well with the salmon.  Try that if you can! "
1533,45033,2003-09-21,5,"Hi Bev, This where great, They turned out perfect, wonderful flavour and nice and fluffy. I served these with Miss Snnie's Prime Rib Roast, Bergy's Onions, Onions & more Onions, Derf's Italian asparagus. It was the perfect meal for our special night. thanks so much."
1089925,26963,2010-10-17,2,"My family loves olives, but wasn't a big fan of this recipe.  It was fun to make though, thanks for posting."
1356010,120175,2009-08-21,5,"This was great, made it at a dinner party and everyone loved it.  We made a risotto with the broth instead of couscous, which worked great."
577908,219407,2008-02-13,2,"This recipe seemed to make WAY more than stated. I filled a full 13X9 pan and then a square cake pan as well. I followed the directions very carefully, too, as far as the amts of the ingredients. I was not crazy about the flavor. I am used to cabbage rolls made with a tomato soup base, not so spicy. I don't think I would make this again, though I can see where some people would like it very much."
1615404,202055,2017-04-14,1,"I really should cool down before posting, but..... I attempted this for Easter 2017. As a matter of fact, it's chilling in the fridge and Easter is two days away. I have already driven the 1 1/2 hours to our food store for the week-- so there is no turning back...... 3.5 oz of gelatin????? I use gelatin all of the time and have never used this quantity to set something. That was like 3/4 cup!!!! I should have known. AND that amount wouldn't dissolve in 1/2 cup milk. My Vita-Mix couldn't even grind it all up. I wasted like 1/2+ cup of grass-fed gelatin (actually I did keep and and will remelt for MANY other recipes. It just infuriates me that this was so poorly written, AND that I got taken. I sinerely hope that enough gelatin was incorporated to set this so that my homemade lady finger aren't wreaked too."
726636,262751,2011-02-01,5,"This was a great, light salad. The kids even loved it. I chopped the veggies and had them all on the side so we could all make what we wanted. I had black olives, avocado, mushrooms, zucchini, tomatoes and cheese on mine. Mmmm. Very tasty. The kids weren't crazy over the dressing so they put on which ever is their favorite. And to top it off, they asked if I'd make them into wraps for lunches today. Thanks for the recipe!!"
67656,283812,2009-02-13,5,"A few years ago I first learned the lore of the famous Cincinnati chili and have been curious since. When I saw this particular recipe I was truly intrigued as the spice combination reminded me more of something one might find in from North Africa.  Made as presented with a small substitution of chopped mushrooms for about 4 ounces of the meat as I was a little short.  I had a little bit of a hard time deciding how too best rate this dish.  Had I been looking to satisfy a hankering for what I think of as chili, this would have fallen a little short. No beans, pasta instead of rice, the spices.  But as a meal without preconception, I loved it and for me it was like Moroccan spaghetti.  The unique combination of spices were fantastic a good level of heat with some autumnal undertones in a thick rich base of tomatoes.  Pure comfort for me.  Thanks.  Made for Potluck Tag."
32058,26337,2008-06-22,4,Not a 5 Star Meal according to our family.  Everyone has different tastebuds.
2001227147,325571,2016-10-31,5,I made this tonight and it was really good. I halved the recipe so I have two loaves. I cooked one right away and the other dough is in the refrigerator for tomorrow. I'm interested in seeing if it tastes different. I'm very happy with it.
628753,71273,2009-10-19,5,This is an absolutely perfect recipe. Very spicy much to our delight (so faint of heart- be cautious of the red pepper flakes). Hubby said is the best sauce he has ever had- and that was still 3 hours after dinner. We cooked for 1-2 hours- had one meatball (that we cook at 350 for the 'time'). The let it cool place in refrigerator- had the next night- OH MY!
539977,159837,2008-02-10,5,"The quinoa in this recipe is talking about the Quinoa FLAKES not the actual seed looking part. That is why is says like delicate oatmeal.  Quinoa flakes can be found in the cereal section of your healthfood store (usually). Also, vanilla is only gluten free if it says it is gluten free!!  
As for the cookies, I have a similar recipe off my Quinoa Flakes box only it uses 1 cup rice flour, and 3/4 cup quinoa flakes.  In fact this recipe is EXACT except for the high altitude changes. I made mine with peanut butter. I am the only one allergic to wheat and my WHOLE family (7 kids) loved these and so did I!  I got 24 cookies out of it which lasted only until they cooled enough to touch. You have to let them sit on the cookie sheet about 5 to 10 minutes or they are too delicate and fall apart. I used parchment paper so I wouldn't have to deal with sticking. Also, we cooked ours for 15 minutes on the West side of Washington state. But it is raining right now so that most likely didn't help. The peanut butter covers the ricey and quinoa flavors. BTW, if you use whole quinoa you need to rinse it and toast it or the saponin will make them bitter and awful!"
339280,125618,2006-12-13,5,"Thanks so much Charmie for posting this recipe.  I made it last night for DH and myself, he loved it!  DH was feeling a little short changed as far as dinner was concerned due to the fact I'm in the throws of baking Christmas cookies and have been for two weeks and a week left to go.  Not much time to think of dinner.  This meal was easy, absolutly delish and a 5 star presentation.  I'm now back in his good graces.  Will make again and again.  Thanks again, awesome.  Leslie"
515278,287149,2009-06-03,5,My children LOVED this!!!
1905490,193405,2012-01-06,5,"Yummy!!! I made these for my fiancÃ© for his birthday and they were a huge hit! I did use a little less graham cracker than suggested and also baked the crust for about 10 mins instead of 6. Also I added about 10 mins to the final baking time so that the cookie topping wasn't so gooey, I wanted it to have a little crunch. The recipe says to serve at room temp but we all agreed they were much better refrigerated and served cold. If you love cheesecake and chocolate chip cookies you can't go wrong with this recipe. I'll definitely be making again!"
199198,219035,2013-05-13,5,"This is light and fluffy....really tasty!  I added about 1/2 cup of half and half to the egg mixture. I also added green onions, mushrooms, red pepper and cooked turkey bacon..along with the asparagus. Turned out great...I will be making this again..Thanks!"
776846,167664,2008-06-18,5,"very good cupcakes but the directions do not go with the video,check it out: Add eggs one a the time and mix vanilla extract with the milk.Add milk in three parts alternating with the flour. I used 1 1/2 tablespoon  baking powder and 1 1/2 cups sugar. Fill the cups half full. Enjoy it"
428885,113105,2012-04-04,5,"Quite perfect this Spring afternoon, as we beckon in a new season! If you don't sit yourself down to this incredibly, tasty, delightful, star sandwich then I don't know what ails ya. Super easy, super g o o d, and super fresh! Oh, and be sure you use the avocado, sends this to a whole new level! Got it? Thanks for posting this, Diena! Made for National Tomato Month, Diabetic Forum April 2012"
197023,149748,2006-01-15,4,"Totally delicious and very easy to make!  I used slightly less oil and added about a teaspoon of lemon zest to the oil, and I sautÃ©ed five cloves of minced garlic in non-stick pan in about a tablespoon of butter.  After drizzling the potatoes with the garlic and butter, I garnished them with fresh thyme leaves.  We ate them with meatloaf and salad.  They looked and tasted great!  Thanks for sharing!"
116687,131090,2011-11-16,0,"Good! Added onion to the meat, used sun dried tomatoes instead of raisins, out of cumin so used taco seasoning. Instead of biscuits used refrigerated pastry crust. The kiddos did not like the olives but we did. Next time will double the meat and freeze half for another meal."
351811,273410,2008-07-23,5,"I love pasta!!!! This was a wonderful side dish.... that I could easily make into a main dish as I ate too much ;) Easy to prepare and had a great flavor combination. I made the recipe as stated, except I used Extra Light Olive Oil and low sodium Chicken Broth. When I make this again, and I will, I want to try it with my favorite Capellini pasta for a lighter dish. Thanks for sharing this *keeper* (Made for Bevy Tag 7/08)"
539977,221248,2011-09-25,5,"I made this but used baking powder biscuit dough I had made, and I forgot the milk, but the kids still LOVED it!  Thank you for another winner!"
2001449380,303376,2017-03-22,5,"Just finished making and eating this. I am feeding a horde so modified it slightly to accommodate not havng quite enough to double the recipe, and mostly all that entailed was adding a can of refried beans to the meat mix. Left out the jalape&ntilde;os. I also used my own taco seasoning, recipe available on garden-of-eatin.com So in actuality, I made it almost exactly as written, and it's a solid 5 star. Definitely use a good salsa, a poor one would make the difference in a recipe like this!"
913076,336592,2009-03-08,5,"This is an easy weeknight recipe. It's just two of us so i halved the recipe with no problem.  I also used a very light breading of Panko bread crumbs instead of flour.  Thanks for an easy, flavorful recipe!"
178738,111302,2007-11-29,3,"I love Luby's fish, but this recipe didn't work out as well as I'd hoped. I used day-old wheat bread to make crumbs, and thawed some frozen cod filets. However, the fish took nearly 45 minutes to cook rather than 20, and it didn't have that light, flaky texture of the fish at Luby's. Plus, with that extended cooking time, the topping got extra hard and crunchy."
1417765,362800,2011-06-22,5,This zuppa is hearty and flavorful. A real comfort food for me. I use unsalted chicken stock in mine and I just don't miss the salt at all!
73917,38496,2003-11-05,5,"Tender, juicy, tastey, easy."
1404437,376109,2010-06-21,5,"This was really really good!! 
I couldn't stop eating these!!!
Because I used green peas of can (sorry!), I was able to perfectly easily make it. 
Because I didn't have a chive and crouton, I omitted them. 
But I put sour cream on the top. 
It was so creamy and super delicious!!! 
Next time, I intend to put the chili sauce on the top.
I'll make this one from now on, again and again!
Thanks for a wonderful meal!!!"
1839856,369791,2013-05-30,0,"Best lentil soup recipe! We all loved it. I didn&#039;t have grains of paradise, but will try it when I find some. Substituted with ground black pepper and a cardamon pod."
936601,326354,2009-03-21,5,"Really delicious pie!  I used Splenda Brown Sugar blend, since I was giving this to my Dad.  He just loved it!  I will make this pie for him again soon!  Very yummy!  Made for 1.2.3 Hits"
293806,157080,2006-06-19,5,I had this at Olive Garden recently. This recipe turned out exactly like I wanted!!   Thanks!
693345,166118,2009-10-21,5,"Great recipe! I followed preparation of the fish as written, but I baked the tilapia instead of pan frying (400 degrees for 17 minutes). I also added 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1 tsp. garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper to the breadcrumbs, since other reviews mentioned it was a bit bland. I also used 1 1/2 tsp. dried parsley flakes, instead of fresh parsley, because that's what I had on hand. My husband and I sprinkled a little lemon juice over the fish before eating it, and it was awesome. This is the first time I have used panko breadcrumbs and I really liked them - my favorite tilapia recipe so far. Thank you!"
165612,88489,2010-07-29,5,"Oh my word, these are amazing little things! My 3 year old daughter ""helped"" me make them. They were so easy and they really do taste like little brownies! I'll have to try to make them smaller next time - they turned out perfectly done this time, but I do think I'd prefer to have them bite size to reduce crumbs. Thank you!!!!"
187103,71409,2005-02-09,5,"So simple but so good!  I had a head of cabbage that needed to be used, and remembered a dish that a friend used to make, handed down from her family. I looked up a recipe here on Recipezaar, and found this one.  Not the healthiest dish in the world, but easy and good.  This recipe followed to the letter will result in a perfect dish.  I served with sausage.  "
497135,178417,2007-05-09,4,A little Tip: my mom makes this all the time and is well knowned for it. But what she does is just marinates it in salt and pepper. And when it comes time to Barbecue it she cooks until it is fully cooked but still juicy that way the kelaguen isnt dry. You could also try wrapping it like a burrito in a flour tortilla it tastes really good.
41578,194746,2007-10-06,5,"Oh boy, does this ever hit the spot.  I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  Very flavorful and the water chestnuts give it a nice crunch and texture (I cut the slices into quarters).  The sauce is outstanding and hubby wants this dish to be a regular on our table.  Thanks for yet ANOTHER great recipe, Mommy Diva!"
844554,130137,2011-04-27,5,This is one of my favorite ways to eat cucumbers. I use seasoned rice vinegar and no sugar. I've been using this recipe for many years. YUM!
1362345,350655,2009-08-27,5,"I've used a similar recipe for BBQ ribs for 40 years, and have always gotten rave reviews from family and friends.  You should know, 792572, that many professional chefs use catsup in their BBQ sauce recipes.  It contains an already perfect balance of spices and vinegar and helps with the texture of the final reduced sauce.  If HF corn syrup is a concern, there are brands available at Whole Foods or other organic type stores that do not contain it.  We use one of them.  Good recipe!! Thanks for posting it!!!"
22724,24986,2002-05-24,4,Great creamy mac & cheese!!  This one is my family's new favorite!!
40961,155369,2007-12-03,5,"This bread is delicious. We had it tonight for dinner with # 12039,Italian Sausage Vegetable Soup.It was the perfect combination on a cold, rainy day. I know this will become a regular favorite bread in our house, thanks for sharing."
437776,47107,2008-11-30,5,"i made these by hand and made them into 12 rolls. i added an extra 2 tbsp of margarine. they turned out really soft with a great texture. i don't think it tastes exactly like portuguese sweet bread for me, just regular sweet dinner rolls."
444967,195832,2009-06-04,4,"This smelled fabulous while it was cooking.  I tasted it and it was just wonderful.  However, I would leave out the lemon.  I put in about 1/4 tsp. of lemon zest from my microplane and the lemon was a turnoff for us.  I don't usually like citrus in my food, unless we are going for Picatta or real lemon chicken.  My husband doesn't mind it, but he didn't like it in this.  Without the lemon, it was wonderful!"
551498,55324,2010-01-10,5,"Great recipe! I added apple to the bottom of the pan which was fabby. Next time I will reduce the amount of sauce, only a cup of water and a cup of sugar - there was soooo much sauce it was crazy. This recipe probably serves 4-6 adults as a big pudding with nothing else. With ice cream or lots of fruit, 8 easily. Thanks for posting, will make again!"
510362,156236,2009-06-25,5,"The perfect combination of sweet, spice, and heat - a real winner, and there are some mighty picky eaters in our house!  Substitutions made to use what was on hand: 2 Tbs. dried orange peel for zest of 1 orange in the rice; 1/8 tsp garlic powder for garlic cloves; 1 tsp onion powder for onion; 9 baby carrots, sliced for shredded carrot in the stir fry; 1 tsp ground ginger for the grated ginger root; a dash of garlic powder for the garlic clove in the satay sauce.  Used brown jasmine rice instead of white and cooked for 35-40 minutes as directed on package.  Thanks for sharing!"
498271,346506,2009-09-26,4,Great biscuits - light and fluffy!  These were easy to make and baked up perfectly in 15 minutes for a yummy and quick homemade breakfast - thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for Fall PAC 2009
47892,218950,2011-02-05,0,"The fresh beans cooked in 5 minutes, adding the sesame seeds the last 1 minute of stir frying to lightly brown. A small amount of toasted sesame oil added some flavor depth. Was a delicious accompaniment to Recipe #398139 especially the extra sauce drizzled over plain brown rice!"
305531,125898,2015-05-22,5,"Really good. It did take a little more time (as previously said) but it was worth it. Really enjoyed this alongside carne asada for Cinco de Mayo. Thanks for sharing, CG. Made for Bevy tag."
1648730,27509,2010-07-15,5,"My husband and I tried this recipe for breakfast this morning.  We often have leftover Hawaiian bread from communion each Sunday, so I used that for the bread.  It really did not need syrup at all - but we used some! Yum!"
301724,69173,2008-10-04,5,Oh...my...goodness!! Sooo easy. Love the texture. Tried it with all beef. Delicious! Thank you!
889443,59056,2008-09-25,5,"This a hit with me, my husband and three year old! This was very simple to make and oooooohhh so good. I did use rubbed sage but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I think I will use a little less of the catsup sauce next time as it was a little over powering...it is a great topping though. I'll be making again really soon."
161282,98724,2005-03-27,5,"This sandwich is truly one of summer's finest pleasures, though I eat em' all year long of course. Miracle Whip is my spread of choice. Healthy, inexpensive, juicy, and delicious."
1918475,124054,2011-05-27,5,Our Family Loves this relish. It is better than what you get at the store. You can even use the overload of cucumbers and zucchini. Thanks for sharing. This is our third year for using it!
267853,822,2008-07-25,5,"This is the first time I've tried ""cake mix cookies"" and I was really impressed.  You would be disappointed if you expect normal crispy type cookies.  They have great flavor but are definitely very cake-like.  I made them with white cake mix and frosted them with canned chocolate frosting.  They are like mini cakes.  Very tasty and easy to make.  Thank you!"
421027,52782,2007-01-03,3,"This is a tasty recipe.  I was a little nervous about the cumin, since I haven't had much luck with it in other recipes, there was no need...  This is a great way to sneek in some zucchini with those picky eaters!"
158086,74332,2010-12-21,5,"I was drawn to this recipe because the dressing went on the bottom, and i wanted to put breadcrumbs on the chops instead of just frying them....it turned out great and the chops stayed nice and moist..."
2001465107,135272,2017-03-31,5,So yummy! I used cayenne pepper instead of paprika.
206854,67949,2005-08-06,5,DELICIOUS!!Thanks for a tasty easy recipe that we will make again and again.
195589,14979,2009-08-05,4,"I am not sure what I did wrong, but my pie did not set up at all. I followed other reviewers suggestions, such as custard should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. And the custard was thick and bubbly too. In spite of that, the flavor was excellent! I will try again, thanks for posting Lennie."
573325,361789,2011-07-01,5,"This is wonderful! It is so easy to prepare and tastes wonderful! I made the day 3 version using marinated tofu in place of tuna and a yellow onion instead of the red as thats all I had. Also I added in some garlic and pepper. It was so good, Ill certainly make it again. <br/>I had some leftovers and so the next day I added some tomato sauce to juicen them up a bit more and that was even better I thought.<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this keeper with us, Duonyte!<br/>Made and reviewed for 1-2-3-Hit Wonders June 2011."
156653,62702,2005-12-06,5,"Of course, a classic! Love grilled cheese sandwiches with warm tomato soup! Thanks for posting!"
1517472,398642,2010-01-10,5,"Great recipe!  If you like things spicier, you might increase the chili powder and cayenne (and possibly diminish the sugar).  I'll be experimenting with that variation on my next batch.  To make clean-up non-existent, use parchment paper to line the baking sheet.  (Parchment paper is the unsung hero of cooking glazed nuts.  They come out crispy without almost ruining a baking sheet!)  We ate our pecans on a salad of romaine, gorgonzola cheese, balsamic vinaigrette, and granny smith apple.  Delicious!"
237134,109287,2005-12-03,5,"Delicious topping! I used the entire recipe on one apple pie, because I love crumb topping. I covered the pie with foil. I would definitely recommend as it is so good and so easy to make."
530520,191225,2013-12-22,5,I had never made these before - DELICIOUS!  So glad I picked this recipe.  Thanks AprilShowers!
59439,44587,2002-11-22,5,"This bearnaise butter was fantastic!  I was hoping to find a recipe for bearnaise ""sauce"" with no egg, and sure enough here it is!  Thank you Beth for sharing something so delicious and easy."
486725,86849,2010-01-25,5,"This tastes the same or better than storebought. I usually decrease the sugar in recipes 25%, so did that here. Because of that, I also halved the lemon. It took an hour before this became syrupy. It was closer to 3/4 cup than one. I let it cool 30 minutes before refrigerating. Can't wait to try it in a variety of recipes!"
29063,52379,2003-03-11,4,"Made per BF's request. Super easy, tasted great and best of all was very quick. He said it was almost as good as his mom's and if it had some potato chips on it it would be as good as his moms! I doubled the amount of tuna but everything else was the same. Thanks! "
350750,137345,2011-10-28,5,"This was a tasty easy recipe to prepare for lunch.  I think I prefer beef stock instead of chicken, but it was still good as is, Thanks!"
50778,71837,2005-03-17,5,Made this again for another fall buffet. This time I added a bit of lemon zest and cut back a bit on the honey. I then mixed it with sour cream and sweetened cream cheese and piped it into choux puffs (Jessica C's recipe #66769) to make pumpkin profiteroles. Mounded them on a plate and drizzled caramel over all. Sinful little bites that are just too easy to plow through- not a one was left. Thanks Kittencal for this lovely versatile recipe.
2000216130,437729,2015-05-21,0,"Great recipe, I love it! Another thing we do is chill the dough, roll into the balls, then put the balls on the pan and make &quot;Thumbprint cookies&quot; (You&#039;ve probably made or at least seen them before), by pushing your thumb down on the dough. Then you can put chocolate, caramel, jam, custard, etc. before you bake them. They are fantastic!"
126602,145375,2006-10-19,5,"Awesome cinnamon rolls.  I used about 60% wheat flour and %40 white flour and then added in 2 Tbl vital wheat gluten.  For the butter/brown sugar spread I used only 3/4 cup butter instead of a full cup.  I also used a lite cream cheese for the frosting.  Other than that I followed to a tee....and the results...well...these are absolutely sinful!  The bread is soft and fluffy, the inside caramel gooey, and the topping is decadent!  This will be the only cinnamon roll recipe I use from now on...and how easy!  Not at all labor intensive or time consuming...thanks so much for this special treat!"
57042,202530,2008-06-02,3,I gave this recipe 3 stars. I made this for Cameraless Chef 2008. This was yummy. It has a mocha flavor to it which I really liked. My 5 yrs old newphew over heared me talking about the recipe and he had to try it. He liked it to. I think this would be great served with ice. Thanks for posting a yummy recipe! We will have this again. Thanks so much christine (internetnut)
136696,35819,2005-04-03,3,My house rated this a 6- would eat again but not on a regular basis. Thats still good. I have a tough crowd.
140132,390108,2013-10-19,5,These were delicious.  Thank you for sharing with us.  I will continue to make these.  THank you.
117073,389970,2010-02-16,4,It was good and we will probably have this again sometime.  I love the easy crockpot recipes for busy days.
1866846,158990,2011-08-23,5,These are fantastic! I didn't use the chocolate ganache though. But I did put the butterscotch glaze on them. They are very tasty and very easy to make.
255838,54351,2008-07-15,5,"You're truly a ""cookie saver"" is all I have to say! LOL Someone told me that I couldn't cook and I had to prove to them I could by baking oatmeal raisin cookies/walnuts. I googled and came upon this recipe. Their exact words were ""You sure know how to bake some cookies. They were Very, Very, Very, Very Good!"" Thanks so much for sharing Merrie! This is a keeper."
383346,305336,2008-06-16,5,I used orange cherry tomatoes from my garden.  I didn't add salt and pepper.  I loved the taste of these little bites.  Nice appetizer :)  Thanks Emmy.  Made for the Babes of ZWT4
713116,258821,2008-03-19,3,"This was good as a quick-toss-it-in-the-crockpot meal, but we felt it was missing something...  I also had to add a little milk to thin in out a bit, as the sauce was too thick to put over the noodles.  I liked the tarragon flavor to give it some interest.  I didn't have preserved lemon, so I used the zest of a regular one, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  The kids ate it up, and DH had seconds, so all in all a good dinner.  Next time, I might add some garlic to it."
423264,227644,2009-05-13,5,"I am Italian and this is about as authentic as it gets!!  I do cut up fresh mushrooms, celery and green pepper and saute it all with the onions and garlic.  Fabulous!!  Extra garlic always works too!  I add a little parmesan (dry) to the sauce.  YUM!!!!"
128473,464539,2011-10-10,5,"Gailann this dish is a winner, hands down.  Perfect comfort food; spicy sausage, peppers and onions smoothered in cheese than covered with eggs.  What a great meal it was.  I really enjoyed the textures in the dish, the light fluffy eggs, the ooey gooey cheese and the spicy spicy sausage. Quick and easy to make, it was the perfect dinner with a simple salad and some cucumbers and sliced bananas.  Thanks for sharing your recipe. Made for Pac - Fall - 2011."
1877562,99636,2011-04-07,0,It has not set yet!  I hope it will!
1417292,46527,2009-11-07,5,"Delicious!  I used Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream and it worked great.  I think next time I might add one extra pear for more fruit taste, and maybe a sprinkle of cardamom on the pears."
80778,80726,2004-03-02,5,"Delicious!  The ingredients list did not specify what type of applesauce to use, so I used cinnamon applesauce and still used the regular amount of cinnamon (we like cinnamon at our house).  The only apples I had in the house were Gala apples, so I used those.  When I took the bread out of the machine, I wasn't sure it was done but I left it out until it was almost cool and then put it in a plastic bag and closed it tightly.  The next day, the bread was absolutely moist and DELICIOUS!  I will definitely be making this one again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
2000268458,140486,2015-06-14,5,This is the best frosting recipe I&#039;ve found on line so far!
1802854711,73937,2016-10-17,5,"Amazingly simple..yet such rich creamy gravy..deffinetly not spaghetti sauce or marinara......but so MUCH better...a GRAVY..amazing..the meatballs.were great too. I use fresh bread instead of crumbs..my family loved all of it and I made Sasuage, peppers and onions on the side..Thank you for such a great recipie...may be a weekly dinner for sure"
351811,37201,2008-01-09,5,"Excellent, Easy and scrumptious dessert. I loved how easy it was to put together and the kids ate it up. I followed your recipe exact and it was a hit. Thanks for sharing such a delightful dessert! ~V (Made for Bevy Tag Comfort Food)"
2002232759,516073,2018-07-28,0,Mine isn't carmalizing or going brown looks like chicken in soup gross
841835,133295,2009-03-13,5,"My daddy used to make this for me when i was little. If you don't like mayonnaise, you won't like the sandwich. I want to try the bacon idea but I would also like to add the tomato, peanut butter, and mayo combo to the table. I like to toast my bread a just enough to get a solid spread without destroying the bread. I always like to use light Hellman's becuase miracle whip is gross and the light has a tangier flavor. I LOVE THIS SANDWICH...it makes me think of home..."
580295,12877,2009-01-03,4,"Not a red enchilada fan, we prefer the green sauce. This was really good though for a change. Thanks for the recipe."
137050,8432,2008-03-17,5,"Great recipe.  I made these pork chops to serve at a dinner party with friends who are real pork chop fans.  They loved these tender, tasty chops.  The recipe is easy to make and the gravey really added to the flavor and presentation when  serving the chops.  Thanks for posting this recipe."
169430,197113,2007-01-08,4,"I made a 2 serving size amount and it's hard to get the best veggies (broccoli and cauliflower) into that small amount unless you chop it all to tiny bits. So, I used peas, diced carrot, diced celery and what was left of a yellow pepper. I subbed dried fig for the cranberries and added 1/2 a tsp each of ground cumin, coriander, cinnamon and a bit if minced garlic.(skipped the cheese). It turned out wonderful and the almonds were a lovely touch"
41379,24088,2004-02-10,5,Delicious..I doubled the recipe and added 1 cup froz. raspberries and 1 cup frozen strawberries along with 1 cup ice and 1 cup water.  Will add a banana next time.
382203,163170,2011-02-12,5,"My DH loves figs,  and now he loves this recipe.  Thanks"
29196,95632,2007-11-26,5,"mummamills made this and was kind enough to part with a jar. I REALLY loved the sweet, sour chilli flavours and found it delicious with camembert cheese on a cracker."
1800226000,75659,2017-08-24,5,This is my go-to recipe! Love it &amp; thank you for sharing :)
133174,187975,2006-11-20,5,I loved the ease of preparation and that a healthy dinner was on the table in less than 30 minutes.  I used halibut fillets and followed your directions.  This was served with a side salad and potatoes as suggested.
1055699,60821,2009-02-23,5,This wa a great idea! I never thought of combining the two..I used blueberry applesauce and put some fresh blueberries on top...yum!
369715,306971,2008-10-06,4,"This was a good basic recipe. I made this for my sons band and they enjoyed it but thought I could have used more meat. Next time I would add 1/2 pound sausage and 1/2 pound of ground beef. I did omit the mushrooms as I wasn't sure if they all liked them or not. I also added a lot more cheese then called for. I didnt measure, I just dumped as we love cheese. I thought it could use more seasoning also but the kids didn't say anything about that. Made for Fall PAC 2008."
427101,180119,2007-06-01,4,"This recipe was pretty good, tasty and easy.  However, I had a few difficulties with the recipe.  I found that it was more of a marinade than a rub, as the name suggests and I found that the meat wasn't overlly tender (it might have been the cut I bought).  On the positive side, it was very tasty and made a nice meal."
1072593,260563,2012-01-12,5,I got it...I got it!  How 'bout I just eat this pizza and then make you another one.
272731,27208,2005-12-12,4,"This was the first roast I ever cooked, and I was nervous. I added potatoes, carrots, onions and celery along with a sirloin tip roast. I only added half the ranch dressing because we try to keep sodium lower. It turned out wonderfully! I was excited that I could do it. ALL the vegetables were eaten-they actually tasted better than the roast. I also seared the roast before I put it in the crockpot-I hate meat that hasn't been browned. It was SO easy."
162826,210160,2007-06-02,5,"Outstanding is not even of a superlative to describe this salad...Made exactly to your recipe with green onions, not purple.. Holy Krab! This is truly an unforgettable salad..Perfect crispiness,love the curry dressing and the pasta shells add just the right softness. YUM!
So very glad I picked it for My3Chefs."
1208760,69906,2013-02-22,5,"One of my hubby's faves (with a few tweaks!)  I've never made this recipe without doubling it, so I don't know how the rice behaves in the original recipe, but the first time I doubled the rice, and the rice completely took over!  So now it's 1 1/3 - 1 1/2 cups rice, 3 1/2 - 4 cups water.  I also add 1 can each of bean sprouts, water chestnuts (chopped) and bamboo shoots before cooking.  This is a great, easy weeknight meal."
111163,17978,2007-12-13,4,Very good salmon recipe.  I loved the simplicity of the ingredients and the method.  Will be making this often!
172057,22698,2005-08-21,5,"This recipe is amazing! I added a tbsp of oil because I like my muffins moist, also I used brown sugar instead of white for the strudel topping. I love them! They're fabulous! Thanks for posting this recipe."
281112,76828,2006-08-22,5,"Made this for the office potluck, but used a very large tart pan. Everyone raved about it. One co-worker got mad at me - she said I ruined her diet - she couldn't stop at just one piece. One guy told me I really ""nailed it"". I used fresh nectarines, plums, kiwi, blueberries and strawberries.
I can't wait to make this again!"
6357,71393,2003-10-19,5,"Very yummy goodie! This gave me another idea while making these and here it is: Follow the same steps as for this recipe, but use milk chocolate chips instead of white and Rice Krispies instead of the Golden Graham cereal. I doubled the ingredients and made it using Rice krispies and milk chocolate. I shaped this candy into little cockroaches since I'm making these as a food gift for a little girl and teaching her a bit about animals. LOL:) Thanks for the recipe and the fun!"
564718,209226,2007-11-22,5,These are also great for get togethers where there are lots of kids.  I make the blox (separately!) in a number of colors and then mix them all together in a large clear plastic bowl.  Colorful AND fun for the kids (and all the rest of us!)
11176,120363,2012-07-24,0,"Much as I'd like to have used regular bacon and cheddar cheese, I'm on a mission to keep my husband alive, so I chose turkey bacon and fat-free cheddar. Won't be doing the latter again - the resemblance to actual cheese was nil! The turkey bacon (Oscar Mayer) was quite nice in this dish and I imagine using real cheese will improve it substantially. Oh, I also removed half of the egg yolks. With all those changes, I hesitate to give this any star rating, but I'll do so if I get the chance to make it as written. Thanks for posting, BecR!"
2001598898,463708,2017-08-08,0,"This cake is brilliant and easy to make, becomes more moist the next day. Just the right texture even when you only have 2 eggs to use! You could use a mix of fruit/peel instead of just sultanas too. YUM"
220195,410533,2013-01-08,4,"This is very close to the recipe I use, which has a bit less sesame. Try it rubbed under the skin of a roasting chicken, it's great! Also good on pita, salads, hummus, and vegetable dishes."
697860,277466,2009-10-15,5,A great tasty dish.  I halved the recipe but followed recipe exactly.  It took one hour to bake in the oven to reach 180 degrees for me.  That could be because my chicken breast were quite large.  Loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!
1706426,228537,2011-08-28,5,"Very easy, and it is ""perfect"". A standing rib roast is so expensive, I was a bit timid about cooking it, but this recipe  is outstanding!"
205786,9131,2008-12-26,5,"Sorry to disagree with anyone but there is NO danger of botulism in this recipe.  Botulism requires a low acid environment and is not an issue in this high-acid food.  Yes, modern canning methods say they must be processed but many people have had sucess without doing so - probably because they are very careful about cleanliness.  Other types of spoilage will be fairly obvious and most of us would know to discard a spoiled product."
325816,189156,2007-11-19,3,Well after reading the other ratings I added both sugar and vanilla to the cream cheese and chocolate chips as well however these weren't quite as I had hoped for. They were good but not fantastic although they looked exceptionally pretty.
323186,357820,2009-10-05,5,"Very very good, and apart from spending some time preparing the spinach (I couldn't get baby spinach so used normal), this came together quickly for an excellent, spicy and yet well-balanced curry, not overly hot at all, tho you could up the heat if you chose to.  This spinach curry would be excellent paired with anything, I chose not to use the cheese but to pair this with sauteed shrimps, mmm, excellent!
We really enjoyed this authentic curry, thank you Pavithra!
Made for PAC Fall 2009"
2001808442,496614,2017-11-20,5,it turned out so good I was so excited when it came out very good
1072593,61319,2014-10-25,5,"Delicious!  Oh, you know what?  It appears that I will NEVER die.  If my pile of  &#039;to make&#039; recipes shrinks by fractions, I&#039;m off to replenish my stock."
187276,232322,2009-02-17,2,Made this tonight.  It was ok.  Nothing to write home about.
1609532,131018,2011-01-04,5,"Love this recipe! I am not one who likes to cook and this was easy! Just throw in the ingredients, let it sit, and out comes a great dinner.  Freezes great too so you can enjoy it in months to come!"
59064,50101,2004-09-26,5,Good pizza base that comes out of the breadmaker with a good texture that is not overly sticky. I made one large pizza which made quite a thick bready base but you could easily make two from this recipe.
323328,189012,2009-11-15,5,"Made these this morning for DH's birthday breakfast as he's the pancake expert in our house and he gave these 5 stars as did I.  I made following the directions, using real butter instead of fat-free margarine as I did not have any on hand.  Wow, lots of flavor!!  The spices are just right, just be sure they are well combined with the other ingredients. These came up light and fluffy and delicious. We had them with maple syrup but I liked them better warm just with butter.  I think the suggestion of apple pie filling would be great too.  Thanks prattandpratt for a recipe I know we'll make again!!  Made for My Three Chefs Nov 2009."
2000206835,17982,2015-05-29,5,Excellent flavor! Super easy to make and clean up is a breeze. I served it over cauliflower rice and my husband raved. We&#039;ll be having this again!
136828,254206,2008-09-14,5,"I've been using this recipe for some time, and my hummingbirds love it.  They're at the feeder several times a day.  I do add a little red food color, although it's not necessary.  Good tips on keeping the feeder clean.  Also, we have very hot weather in the summer, so I clean the feeder more frequently because the food will ferment in the heat.  After all, you don't want your hummingbirds flying under the influence."
173579,26820,2009-03-24,5,This was very good.  Nice and crunchy.  I  served ours with Papa John's dipping sauce.  Great!  Thanks for posting this simple recipe.
486648,250276,2011-06-21,5,"I tried this twice hoping that it might change my mind about lemon in my tea (because I really wanted to be able to sip on this of an evening), but I really don't like tea and lemon mixed together! This would be perfect for anyone out there who enjoys a slice of lemon in their tea and who enjoys a little buzz along with it! I rated five stars because those who tried it, who enjoy lemon with their tea, really enjoyed this! Thanks for posting!"
200339,463626,2018-08-30,5,"My father-in-law is gluten intolerant, so I bake for him a lot! These are delicious! I use this frosting recipe, yum!! https://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/easy-milk-chocolate-frosting-for-brownies-286575"
181231,167914,2008-02-09,5,These were very good and fluffy.I added some flax and wheat germ .Thank you for another good recipe.
50472,26209,2004-05-04,5,I've made this several times now.  Tastes good and comes in handy for a quick meal.  (Beef consomme has now become staple in my cabinet.) I only use 1 pound of hamburger and just make 3 patties.  (I couldn't get six to fit into the casserole dish the first time I made it.) I don't adjust the other ingredients at all and it turns out great. Thanks for a keeper!      
824055,216301,2008-04-23,5,Very easy to make!  And very tasty.  I couldn't find a brisket smaller than 4 3/4 lbs and had to bake for 4 hours.
100811,45562,2009-01-01,5,My husband the sourdough king loved how fast and tasty this bread was to make. Actually all he did was the eating but still loved it. Thanks.
482376,374366,2009-09-09,5,"Oh yes, slightly sinful and oh so delicious! How could only four ingredients produce something this good?! Amazingly easy to put together. You can't even tell that sugar wasn't used. I used unsalted real butter, softened.  This is delicious shortbread. Thank you!"
99308,69846,2003-08-30,5,Always did this in oven but used Cream of Mushroom instead.
498271,301280,2008-07-26,5,"Delicious burritos!  I love the flavor of chipotles and it really came through in this dish.  I liked it with the ground pork and think it would be equally good with ground beef.  Quick and easy, the whole family loved these - thanks for sharing!"
171303,37087,2006-11-08,4,"Being from the north, I wasn't sure we would like this southern classic, but I wanted to give it a try and I'm glad I did.  I too added a bit more garlic and was also able to significantly reduce the amount of oil, and the blend of flavors was delicious, with just the right amount of heat.  Thank you PanNan for sharing the recipe."
298981,154833,2014-02-09,5,I made these for my husbands birthday breakfast this morning.  He LOVES Apple pancakes!!  He gave these a 10 thumbs up!!  I did add ALOT more cinnamon to the apples however.  1/2 tsp just wasn&#039;t going to be enough IMO.  I also used turbinado sugar in the bottom of the muffin pan to give it a little crunch (it was divine!!).  I will definitely be making these again!!  The only thing I wished I had done was take a picture before we devoured them!  They were VERY pretty.  I baked them the full 15 minutes in a 400 degree convection oven.  Delicious!!  Thank you for a delicious birthday breakfast recipe!!
486725,227016,2008-04-18,4,"Yummy scones! I used Smart Balance for the butter, and only 1/2 cup of it. I knew it would work well since I have used even less in other scone recipes. I kneaded this about 6 times for it come together before moving it to the baking sheet. I also separated my wedges just slightly, so it would make it easier to pull them apart later (they do rise back into each other). I really liked the flavor, and the crunch of the glaze."
199394,20462,2005-03-01,5,This was wonderful.  It was easy to make and the dressing was just perfect.  It is also a very colorful salad.
39835,162807,2006-09-11,2,"Something went wrong with this - maybe we needed to cook it longer or something. We used regular potatoes, sliced and they weren't cooked all the way through. My dh actually put his in the micowave to cook longer! The sauce didn't  thicken up (I did use the healthy choice type of cream of mushroom soup, 2 % milk and low fat sour cream - so don't know if that was a factor or not. Sorry!"
1140904,214142,2009-07-13,5,"Delicious! My husband loved it and it was gone in one meal! One thing I did different was use brown rice and cooked for about an hour. I had to add more water and the rice was still a little too chewy, but that was my own fault. Never the less it tasted very good."
59163,164127,2007-09-22,4,"I have now used this several times this summer. My hubby and I really enjoy this.  We buy our beef from a local farmer, grain fed and very lean this is a nice compliment to any steak."
278546,102617,2010-04-08,5,"I prepared this recipe a whole day in advance for my huge Housewarming party of 14 and it turned out amazing! I left the celery seeds, spring onions and buttermilk out and re-adjusted the amount of lemon juice and vinegar along the way. So refreshing, so easy, and the flavor couldn't get any better. Really hard to believe this was homemade. Thanks for this incredible recipe!"
464080,222479,2008-06-22,3,"These just didn't do it for me. . .sorry!  I love all the ingredients, just not all together.  They were a bit bland (although vinegary), so I added a little seasoning salt and pepper which did help.  Only used 1 tbsp vinegar and frozen french cut beans.  Made for ZWT4."
1085374,352102,2009-07-14,5,"I have tried so many of your recipes, this one is GREAT !!!! Thanks again for something easy and good"
2000579376,92021,2015-10-19,5,"I have no idea why the first review said they couldn&#039;t get this to stick together on the grill.   Be gentle with the meat and leave it alone while it is on the grill.  Don&#039;t pat, poke, or flip it more than once.  I did this recipe as stated with no extra add ins.  The result was simply burger heaven.  This was the first time I attempted to prepare my own patties.  I will never by the frozen junk again.  This is too easy to make and adds a whole new definition of burger.  This was the best burger I have ever had!"
211184,128679,2006-07-06,5,"Rita this was excellent! We grilled the shrimp on skewers and added mushrooms, tomatoes, and lychees. DH says he really like this recipe and we will have it again. Thanks for another winner!

Nick's Mom"
461724,89577,2008-06-18,4,Was looking for a recipe to use some extra cilantro I had on hand. DH and I both enjoyed it.  Thanks for posting!
1609858,111111,2013-03-20,4,"Different and suprising.  Liked the flavor.  I grated the carrots instead of jullianning them.  So it was a different texture, I&#039;m sure.  Could definately see this as an accompianment to asian or middle eastern foods.  Maybe not so much as a &quot;salad&quot; though.  I gave it to my one year old on bread like a sandwich.  He ate it and seemed to like it.  I ate mine spread over some foccocia bread as a side dish to some soup.  I could also see it being kind of like a &quot;dip&quot; with crackers."
466405,66447,2007-03-16,4,"I used dried cherries instead of raisins and didn't mix them in until after I took the granola out of the oven.  The result was quite tasty, but I would recommend baking the granola at a lower heat since mine came out a little burnt.  It was still tasty and my friends keep asking me to make it again."
904483,187708,2009-01-30,5,"Gerry this looks sooooo very delicious and I am tired of making banana bread! 
DH said ""Make it!"" :)"
344069,50842,2009-01-06,5,"I didn't think this sounded very good, but thought I'd give it a try just to add some variety.  He LOVED it!  Thanks!"
936601,148783,2009-10-12,5,"Di this recipe is so delicious!  DH hinted that chili would be good today!  When I looked out the window and saw the snow coming down I had to agree!  This is similar to my own chili recipe except for a couple of things -- the beer and the cumin.  I was happy to add both and try something new!  Wow!  This is awesome!  Oh, and I made this in my slow-cooker on low for 4 hours so the flavors really blended together beautifully!  Thank you dear friend!  I will make this often I'm sure!"
1479319,163811,2010-01-03,5,"I've been making this since I was 15; I'm 23 now. I too found this on the back of a soy sauce bottle and tore it off because I really liked it when my mom and I made it. It's very popular with pretty much everyone I've ever made it with. If you don't have a wok, I've found it's also really convenient to cook it in like an electric multi-cooker."
200243,192098,2009-05-09,5,My family love this recipe. Everyone fights for the potatoes.
494084,356632,2014-05-05,5,This is a great veggie chili.  Make it just as written (although it halves easily if you don&#039;t need quite so much).  Thanks Kittencal....
1250369,71085,2014-01-27,3,"My daughter loved this. Hubby thought it was good. I on the other hand did not like. I could only eat a few bites. I thought it was very plain. Also way to thick, seemed more like chicken and noodles than soup. I noticed a lot of other reviewers added veggies maybe that would have helped to give it more flavor."
2001228906,54351,2016-11-01,5,Best oatmeal cookies we have ever had! All friends and family love them! Outstanding cookies with no changes to the recipe. Thank you!
297543,40467,2006-05-24,5,Easy and tasty. Nice twist on time consuming lasagna. Will be making this time and again.
1009223,176506,2009-05-09,5,Wonderful!  I froze these and then cooked them in a crock pot and they were so tender and the flavor was amazing!  We will have these again and again!
40525,10589,2003-08-10,5,"My mom swears that not only are these the most amazing biscuits she has ever tasted, but found that they were just about the easiest to make, too! We had to use the whole 1 cup of yogurt.  Absolutely melt-in-your-mouth!"
143721,307828,2008-06-07,5,"Made this today for ZWT4.  Had been working on house today in upper 90 degree temperatures.  This was very refreshing and thrist quenching.  After the first two glasses, add some rum and this makes a real nice drink!  Thanks for a new summertime beverage."
1870301,403282,2012-11-01,4,"I have to take back my former review and put a new rating on this recipe. I must have done something wrong the first time I made this (I think the soy sauce I used at the time was what ruined it), because I gave it another shot and have made it many, many times after that! It's so great! One of my favorite alfredo sauces for sure."
69927,72627,2005-06-03,5,"This was a great sandwich.  I followed the recipe except for omitting tomato, and dunked it in ajous.  Thanks for a tastey, easy summer sandwich."
199771,86071,2005-03-02,5,This was fabulous!  I haven't tried Tempeh before as it hasn't previously been available in my town.  I can see this becoming one of those dishes I cook often.
169430,357091,2009-08-05,5,This is so thick that you could almost use a spoon.  I didn't add any sweetening I tasted after blending and it was sweet enough.  No way you could go wrong here.
2000604934,25520,2016-11-27,5,So I did everything &quot;as written&quot; but the amount of salt was left open-ended. I thought with cooking wine and Parmesan cheese it wouldn't need a lot but I was wrong. We ended up salting them after serving. This made them very tasty. The family loved them.
1236791,303295,2009-08-21,5,"What a wonderful blend of flavours! I used this to top bread slices and served them with tomato soup. Needless to say everyone loved them. The next time I am going to save the time and effort on whipping up the soup and just serve this with something from the can. 

Two thumbs up!"
235982,101104,2009-12-24,5,This pie just can't be beat.  It is better using the individual spices.  I think that what makes this recipe unique is that it does not have nutmeg in it.
2001896443,392356,2017-12-28,0,Am I supposed to preheat the oven before putting in the bacon or do I put it in at room temp? Turning the oven on after I have prepared seems a bit counterintuitive. Thanks!
306812,78158,2006-03-30,3,"A good recipe to start with but when comparing this to ketchup bought in a store this has WAY too much vinegar.  I have made this recipe as written and also with the following change:
Use 3 ounces of vinegar and 3 ounces of water instead of 6 ounces of vinegar.  Robb"
790908,117160,2008-03-15,0,"I have had this recipe since 02/07 and have made it several times.  Made the recipe with pork shoulder and did not use orange zest. This is an excellent recipe.

You will have raves when you make it.
               JA"
2483897,31717,2012-11-07,4,Wish this was more soupy. Very good winter soup. Almost stew like. Served it with crusty french bread. Made noodles separate and added independently to bowls instead of in pot like so many recommended. Will have to freeze. This is a ton of food.
841981,45504,2008-07-03,4,This was great! I used steamed fish instead of crabmeat. I didn't have cracker meal so used panko instead.  We loved the remoulade sauce.  Will make it again.  Its delicious when served piping hot.
191819,156427,2006-12-21,5,"DELICIOUS!! Quick,easy,and the kids loved it. Def is a keeper. I did add more cinnamon and will do so again. Soon as I post this DD wants another batch. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
340994,31750,2009-11-26,5,I must admit that I didn't think whipping the egg whites seperately would make a difference but it did!  I've made many waffle recipes and this is the best by far.  They were light and crispy with a hint of butter.  I was a bit worried that the batter seemed runnier than usual but they turned out DELICIOUS! Thanks Elaine!
621175,202833,2007-10-20,5,"This is the best recipe in my cookbook, getting the items is a bit of an hassle, but you can decide to not use some cheeses like fontina, or romano. After that though its smooth sailing, the sauce and the topping are easy to make, and the rest is simple. In about and hour you will have one of the best meals of you life, a little different from olive gardens (they leave pasta a little undercooked), but in essence it's the same thing. Loved it, and will make it again and you should too."
424680,263922,2008-04-06,4,"A nice punch that's easy to make! I only made 1/3 batch this time, & I used a high pulp OJ along with some homemade lemonade & this was very tasty ~ Certainly something I'm willing to make again for a crowd! Thanks for sharing! [Made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in this Spring's Pick-A-Chef cooking game]"
35664,61601,2004-11-20,5,OUTSTANDING! ! ! Being of Polish decent I increased the quantity of garlic.  I also let the reduction process continue longer for a thicker consistency. The family loved it.  I intend to experiment with the thought of a adding a cream/dill twist to the recipe.
156034,56085,2006-05-15,5,"I've made these several times and have just now gotten around to posting a review.

EVERYONE in my house LOVES these wraps.  They are one of the most requested things for lunch on Saturday's.

THANK YOU FOR SHARING!"
1816255,401240,2011-02-03,5,"This was a 'lick-the-bottom-of-the-bowl' kind of good.  Even my 3 and 5-year-olds loved it!!  And other than the time it takes to let the flavors meld, the prep is so simple!!  Yum!"
2213873,328467,2014-01-26,5,Loved this!  So full of flavor and beautiful colors.  I think this may now be my favorite shirmp dish.
470815,106262,2012-04-21,5,"YUM O...great, easy and wonderful.  I added just a little sugar, 2/3 cup, the apples I used were not really sweet neither was the juice.  GREAT!!!"
601700,105670,2007-12-03,5,"Made this yesterday as a snack, scaled down the proportions because it was just me eating, and I loved them. Cooked the bacon before, and added it into the cream cheese, with the cheddar and then put more bacon on top, and it was great. Will be definitely making them again and again and again........"
550713,213935,2009-11-23,4,"I had to use 1 and 1/2 lbs of meat in order to get enough meatballs.  Using only 1 lb gave me 16 meatballs and I really need 24-ish to fill the dish.  I also made the meatballs half ground beef and half ground pork, but that's just a flavor preference."
383346,288501,2008-03-30,5,"I used no fat sour cream.  I used a white cake mix (I didn't have yellow).  For the filling, I didn't pack brown sugar cause I didn't want it too sweet.  And even if I love cinnamon, I used only 1 teaspoon of it.  And no powdered sugar for dusting.  The taste is fabulous.  So tasty.  And not too sweet with my changes.  Thanks Jan :)  Made for 123 hit wonders."
662011,336643,2009-08-12,3,found it was too sweet for lamb
535033,116053,2011-04-20,0,"YUM!!  I mainly used what I had on hand.  So, I used 1-2 shallots, frozen green beans, garlic powder, and hazelnuts and lemon juice.  Tasted great.  Even the leftovers."
148630,15886,2004-07-01,5,awesome recipie.hubby likes it so much i'm making it everyday.so quick and easy i was amazed
166642,168803,2008-06-21,5,"These things are addicting! Just delicious and really very easy to make. I loved the filling! Will make these again, especially for holidays. Made for ZWT4 for the Tastebud Tickling Travellers."
954390,270,2008-09-15,5,"I changed the proportions a little because I was using Keiffer pears. I used 12.5 pounds, coarsely chopped, and a huge kettle, just trimming out cores, stems, and blossom ends. I used the chinois sieve and also made drinks from the extra liquid I drained off. I used 6 cinn. stix, 4 1/2 cu. apple juice, 6 minced slices of gingerroot, 12 whole cloves and 5 1/2 cu. sugar. I put pulp thru a wire strainer also. No gritty things ! It took 35 minutes longer for each step. An hour to thicken and it is heavenly in 7 pints. Use wide mouth so you can get every last bit. Yum."
323186,120810,2008-07-02,5,"Spotted in the ""Getting Curious About Curry' African challenge for ZWT4,  I made this for supper last night.  

I used two chicken breast fillets,  which I cubed,  as it was only DH & I for supper, and I don't eat chicken!  I made the full quantity of sauce though, I eat that :D

It had good rich flavour and was easy to prepare, it smelled wonderful as it simmered quietly,  I allowed it to cook the 40 minutes to allow the flavours to develop.  I used a ginger/garlic garam masala mix for the curry powder, as well as adding the required fresh ginger and garlic.

I served this over brown rice,  we thoroughly enjoyed it, and DH has enough left for lunch today, lucky him :D"
294000,380442,2010-04-12,5,"This is fantastic! I kept eating it raw (and I don't really like raw broccoli) it was so good. I've been thinking there must be a way to grll broccoli and, as this was the only fresh vegetable in the house tonight, I was thankful to find this recipe. Went a little less than a tablespoon on the salt and it was almost too salty.  But then I didn't have a very large head of broccoli.  I will definitely make this one again. Thanks!"
11297,59573,2003-04-23,5,"These are very similar to a recipe I use from my daughters Greek MIL. Instead of the vinegar she uses lemon juice, and also uses just ground beef.   Yours are just as easy to make and tasted wonderful, and yes I made more to have on another night this week.  Thanks for posting, cheers :)"
37449,281130,2008-05-08,5,Oh so good over your Recipe#244193! My DH and I really enjoyed the nice strawberry flavor! Thanks!
1364481,5000,2011-02-09,5,"Very yummy! I roll out and cut the dumplings like the Cracker Barrel does. I just use diced chicken or turkey, celery, carrots, onion, seasonings and low sodium chicken stock in a box to save time. Thank you for posting!"
339239,169032,2006-12-20,1,"These muffins failed the husband test, and the 4 brother-in-law tests. (my brother-in-laws will eat anything edible put before them) They were very very VERY dry. The spices were a bit overpowering and the only things you could taste in them. I omitted the almonds and it still made no difference."
1013595,92043,2010-10-20,0,"not sure this is real cooking, I mean you are taking already prepared food - hash browns and adding stuff to them.  I never like recipes like that as what if you are from a different country- you are unlikely to be able to find hashbrowns anyway."
41578,14462,2004-11-11,5,"Now THAT'S a cheese ball.  Wow, is this ever good.  Who needs the graham crackers?  This is a great make ahead appetizer that is easy to make and one that everyone will loved. Thanks for sharing Suzanne Stewart. "
266635,427797,2015-02-12,5,We really love eggplant and this dish delivers on flavor.  I used Japanese eggplant and grilled them on my electric in-door grill.  Took another reviewer&#039;s suggestion and let the dish sit awhile to allow the flavors to meld.  Made for the Best of 2014 tag game.
2000865451,369886,2016-02-09,5,"This is absolutely one of our favorites. I use 1.5 lbs beef, a small onion, a 15 oz can plus an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, 12 oz spaghetti and 7 cups of water. Make in a large electric skillet. Good on first night, better the next day. Other than adding fresh onion vs dehydated, everything is perfect. We also use extra cheese for our liking."
83660,27144,2003-06-11,5,This cake was easy to make and delicious.  I am making it again for a birthday party.  
1379323,304529,2009-09-23,5,By far the best salsa recipe I have ever tried!
39194,26085,2006-04-23,5,"This was an outstanding tuna/mac salad!  I added some bacon bits and some red onion as well, and LOVED it!  Thank you Di! :)"
427184,183806,2008-03-06,5,Beautiful scones. So easy and they present wonderfully. I glazed the top with whole milk and served them with strawberry jam and homemade clotted cream for a family breakfast. Thanks for posting.
156049,94979,2004-08-05,5,"I used non-fat yogurt and didn't miss the ""fat"" at all.  I think this is on its way to becoming a family staple! Excellent flavor and texture."
2001425691,232717,2017-07-25,5,Served with sprouted brown rice.
369715,444206,2011-03-14,5,Very good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written other then I didn't add the optional cayenne pepper. We all enjoyed these. Made for Spring PAC 2011.
169430,499043,2013-12-17,4,"The final outcome of this recipe gave me 4 lovely big burger buns. Can&#039;t wait to try them with a chicken burger! The short coming was that it was way short on flour amount. I used the 2 cups as ask but needed to add another 1/2 cup right away and probably another 1/4 to 1/3 cup was worked in when forming the buns  as the dough was still so wet and sticky. This has a very nice, and uncommon, chili flavor that will be good with so many things. I almost always make buns because I just can&#039;t use a load before it goes off. Thanks Mike :D. Made for Sweet December game 2013."
632249,289070,2014-04-25,5,"This was great Boomette, we loved it.  I did switch the sugar to Splenda and reduced it as I don&#039;t like things to be too sweet.  I used crushed graham crackers too but granola would be yummy also! Thanks for the simple recipe, I will make this again!"
135470,376897,2011-03-03,5,"Lovely smokey, comfort food! I had my doubts - i thought the bacon would make the whole thing too rich, that there wasn't enough sauce for the amount of noodles, yada, yada, yada, Silly me, it all balanced out just right. DH loved that the dish tasted smokey but not obvious that it was from bacon. This isn't an over saucy dish but that keeps it from being overwhelming .  I too omitted the mushrooms and green pepper and added onion. I used garlic granules and sliced fresh garlic. I started browning the meat, then tossed in the bacon and onion and cooked them well together. I used a mix of sharp cheddar and mozzarella. We have a keeper! Made for Best of 2010 Tag."
193516,90975,2006-06-02,5,This is a very pretty salad.  The colorful veggies offset by the white feta is gorgeous...and also delicious!  I really liked the dressing for this salad - it really complimented the veggies.  Oregano isn't a normal spice in my usual dressings but really enjoyed it here.  I also enjoyed the amount of garlic as I am a garlic lover!  This is a definite make again salad.
278118,15722,2008-08-11,5,These were a thumbs up at our house.  Two kids went back for seconds. :)  I don't like feta cheese so used colby jack.  I didn't have red bell pepper and used green bell pepper from the garden.  Followed everything else exactly.  This was perfect for a warm summer day.  Made for the August 2008 Aussie/NZ recipe swap.
196296,74844,2006-05-30,5,"Thank you for making my Memorial Day BBQ a big hit!!!  Everyone loved your Yakatori and asked for the recipe.  I marinated the chicken in the sauce for a couple of hours, and then basted as you described.  It was fab!  
"
199848,99320,2008-07-21,5,Really yummy and really easy!   It's like traditional comfort food with a little flair.  I used lean ground beef and my own mashed potatoes.  I melted a little extra cheese on top of the potatoes.  Great stuff!  Thanx for sharing this.  I'll make this again for sure.
829250,230769,2012-09-09,5,"I thought these were very good! Marinated over night. I made extra sauce to baste, but it didn't seem like it would be enough to marinated with. So I just used all of it. I had very big drumsticks. I had my husband sprinkle some with red pepper. But I liked it better without. I will use this marinate again."
486725,204291,2007-12-14,3,"We liked this sauce. I think we might like it even more with less condensed milk. That would make it less sweet and the chocolate and peanut butter could really shine through. It went well with waffles and pears, and also as a dip, as it is very thick. Serving size is extremely generous, we ate about 1.5 tablespoons per person each serving. Thanks, Baby Kato!"
1162041,210687,2009-02-08,5,I like this recipe!
98212,31371,2009-05-09,5,This is how I make it except I wrap it all together in foil & cook on the grill in the summer.
317554,290903,2008-06-23,5,"I've been trying and discarding apple cake recipes for the last year--this one is great, and easy.  I left out raisins but added some vanilla and a couple of tablespoons of bourbon for extra flavor.  Reheats nicely in the microwave to pair with ice cream, and does indeed make a good breakfast.  Thanks!"
217824,33707,2006-08-24,5,"OUTSTANDING, DELICIOUS, AND VERY VERY GOOD.  My husband and I were very impressed but my boys did not like it as much.  They'll get over it though.  Anywho, can wait for it to get cold so I can really enjoy it.  Thanks, Shannonmc"
308765,26111,2010-01-16,2,"To me this was quite gluey and bland, I am not sure why it did not work out."
197023,313369,2008-11-03,5,"Great recipe: great blend of flavours. I probably had proportionally more potatoes, so the amount of vinegar was fine for us, and we love cider vinegar. I used grindings of a rosemary and sage blend from a mini blender I acquired recently and I'm finding that that blend is wonderful in so many recipes. I used grindings of black pepper rather than white pepper, as I use it all the time and don't even have any white pepper! The baby onions were very elegant and I'd use them again for serving guests, but unless I can find some peeled and frozen, I'm going to try this next time with regular onions or perhaps a mix of onions and leeks. It's the tedium of the peeling! Oh how lazy are some of us in 2008! Loved the baby potatoes - which we're eating all the time - caramelised! Yum, yum! Thanks so much for sharing this delicious recipe, mersaydees."
2001865205,106641,2017-12-17,5,I use cashews so good
980012,53133,2008-12-05,4,"Very good, the pork came out perfectly cooked.  I gave it four stars instead of five because I altered the recipe a bit and used shallots instead of onions so can not accurately rate the recipe.  Also I doubled the sauce recipe and served the extra over rice.  I LOVE sauces!"
286566,215662,2014-01-03,5,"Loved the acidy from the sour cream with the smoothness from the cream cheese and the sharpness from the vintage cheddar with smooth creamy scrambled eggs, thank you James Cook, made for Name that Ingredient tag game."
1680722,178644,2011-09-15,5,"I think that almost all love these rosemary potatoes!<br/>Instead of boiling the potatoes I put my pyrex with the potatoes 5 minutes in the microwave as the result is similar to ""boiling them"". Then I add only to add the other ingredients.<br/>Completed with roasted garlic this recipe is really special and soo tasty. Thanks a lot for this recipe!"
1802736406,360924,2014-05-27,4,"Tastes nice, would probably have put a bit more spice in it just to make it more exciting but it tastes great anyway. Only thing is the rice came out a bit sticky/starchy, I dunno if that was just me not using enough water or not cooking it long enough. Would definitely make it again with some more spice and maybe added vegetables."

This Rice Pudding Is FABULOUS!!!!! So creamy and delicius,and EASY to make.Thank you so much.Darlene "
808027,353384,2009-04-15,5,Exactly the same way I make guacamole except I add about 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt to mine.  It never lasts long at our house.  And you are right...the mayo is awesome.  I discovered it when I was looking for sour cream (which I used to use instead) and never looked back since.
60304,65084,2008-05-27,5,"This was really good!  It was too hot to turn the oven on and I was craving Mexican so this fit the bill perfectly.
I only had 1 pound of hamburger and 1 can of chili beans so I scaled it down accordingly and it was delicious!  Perfect with a little sour cream on top.  Thanks for sharing this one!"
2001662231,449452,2017-08-08,5,"I was tired of preparing leg quarters the same old way (breaded) and this was the first recipe that popped up in my search. It was such an effortless method. I don't use soy sauce so I worried about how it would turn out when I substituted Frank's Red Hot and used Southwest Sizzle seasoning to complement it....it was delicious and looked really appealing. I never eat chicken skin but in this recipe, it's so crispy and flavorful I ate every bit. The first time I made it, I used 4 leg quarters for three people which lead to huge disappointment from hubby and son because both wanted 2 pieces PLUS pieces for lunch. The second time I made it, I asked hubby to work on 4 as I did 4. He felt his turned out better because he added more spice (he didn't but 37 yrs of blissful marriage means sometimes I just smile and nod) The latest two times (because it's in weekly rotation now) hubby made all 8 and I heard him tell someone roast chicken quarters are his speciality. The cooking times and temps are perfect. The chicken is well cooked but juicy and tender."
187281,3451,2006-12-19,5,"A wonderful alternative to an alfredo sauce.  The best part is that i always have the ingredients (minus shrimp) on hand.  We had this over thin spaghetti for lunch.  It was a great lunch since the sauce was so easy to prepare.  We added canned mushrooms, salt, pepper, parsley and basil to it.  Thanks!"
558979,150863,2010-10-07,5,"With 525 reviews and being a 5 star recipe I had to try it.  We're having a soup bar at work tomorrow so this is what I decided to make.  I have only had a couple spoonfuls but MAN was it GOOD!!  I did add a heaping spoon of sour cream to it after the first taste just cause I thought that zing would add another dimension to it and it does : )  Mmmm, mmmm!  And it really can't get much easier either!"
176615,73927,2011-04-03,5,"This gets five stars for being so easy and so healthy. I used frozen blackberries and baked in a 9x9 pan and it was really too thin. Would increase the recipe or use the correct pan size next time. With a tablespoon of light vanilla ice cream, this was decadent and delicious without being bad. The kids loved it, too. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
770656,76360,2008-02-20,0,My Nana always used to make this with Farmer's cheese which she would crumble in at the end.  Give it a try.  In my opinion a little cheese makes everything better!
122878,76616,2010-06-25,5,"Thank's again Kittencal, you always come through for us. Tonight I used your Taco Seasoning Mix when preparing  ""Recipe #349745"" which I've made several times to great family reviews.  Being out of Taco seasoning tonight, I used this recipe as a substitute and my DH, who never says much, came to tell me that although he always likes this meal, something was different and it was just over the top!  There could never be a better review -- so much for store bought Taco seasoning mix.  This only took minutes to throw together and totally an already very good meal to the exceptional level.  This seasoning is made quickly with ingredients most of us already have on hand.  High five Kitten!!"
285039,118487,2009-03-27,5,"We love chewy cookies in our house and these fit the bill!  I added mocha flavored chips to mine and they turned out great!  That is a good, good cookie...as my youngest son says!"
269521,464233,2012-09-21,4,Followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of poppy seeds) and served with Recipe #265727.   It had a moist quick bread texture.   Not sure if it was the tomatoes I used or what but it was a little bland for our taste.   Wonder what some sun dried tomatoes might add to it.
37463,49200,2003-05-02,5,fantastic!!!

1797076,144377,2012-01-08,4,"Tasty and easy!  I threw in a can of corn I had sitting around, and substituted broth for about half of the water.  I used canned chickpeas and that cut down on the time.  <br/><br/>Perfect soup for a cold winter day!"
68960,203538,2007-11-26,5,Jan made these for us for an Australian 'zaar get together BBQ.  I've never tried anything quite like them before and I thought they were great. Love the sesame in them.
27783,49400,2006-02-28,5,This was so delicious.  I couldn't stop eating this and my guests all loved it.  Really easy to prepare and so beautiful with the bits of cherry speckling the cheeseball. This will be a regular feature on my appetizer tray for holiday parties.
226867,376786,2014-09-05,5,Simple and tasty! made for Culinary Quest 2014
313014,111774,2008-06-28,4,I didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised!  It turned out to be quite good and had nice flavor.  A good way to make use of leftover pickle juice.  Thanks for posting!
202431,33919,2007-11-11,5,"Very Good! Will definately make again, Thanks for posting."
721654,207171,2008-06-22,5,BEST APPLE PIE EVER!  I added 1/2 cup of chopped nuts.  Recipe is a keeper.  WOW!
2054052,104565,2011-12-16,5,"Just made this for Christmas baking. Was very good. I wanted a soft and chewy toffee like Mackintosh toffee I grew up with, so after reading reviews I decided to test my toffee as I was cooking I dropped a bit in water every so often and used a brand new candy thermometer. When it got to 240 degrees it was just perfect. My daughter and I agree. It wasn't quite as flavourful as I would like and next time I may add some vanilla extract or some butterscotch flavoring just to boost the flavor a bit but all in all, this recipe is going in my book of go to recipes"
136997,328951,2013-11-23,5,"Nice change from the creamed cauliflower soups. I only used 2 leeks, as mine were fairly large. It did need a tad more salt. :)"
1680722,465692,2011-10-30,5,Fast and tasty meal.<br/>I used fresh salsa with red bell peppers and chili. I finished my dried garlic so used some chopped fresh one.<br/>I topped the chickien with some green onion.<br/>In 25 minutes everything was ready and the chicken was moist and tender.<br/>Thanks a lot for this easy and yummi menu.
678857,24306,2007-12-23,5,Delicious!  I stirred up some extra sauce and used it for a marinade for the chicken.  The sauce didn't thicken up as much as I would have preferred.  Next time I will heat and stir the sauce in a small sauce pan while the veggies are cooking.  This recipe is going to be a family favorite.  Thank you MizzNezz
1844337,29939,2011-12-04,5,Delicious & easy. BF gobbled it all up!!
197023,319350,2008-10-09,5,"I was totally outside my comfort zone making these so I was very glad of the easy-to-follow-instructions.  I was going to halve the recipe and then I decided against this - that I could freeze what we didn't eat tonight - and I'm so glad to have decided this as they were surprisingly easy to make and SO delicious - in fact positively therapeutic to make after a full-on day at work.  I used a couple of baby carrots (always so sweet and flavoursome), a Savoy cabbage and slightly less than the specified amount of chicken so that I could include some beansprouts.  The Spring Rolls I froze, I froze after step six.  Those we ate tonight, we thoroughly enjoyed - and it will be such a treat to be able to pull a few out of the freezer a few more times.  We've tried lots of spring rolls from lots of different Chinese restaurants - and these were way better than what we have determined as our favourites, so YES, I'll definitely be making these again when the stockpile is depleted!  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Noo!"
293410,276119,2008-01-22,3,"The crockpot cooked the beets very nicely, so putting them in there is a nice idea. Perhaps it was those particular beets,but usually I like them and I wasn't really crazy about the flavor of them here. They were better with some lemon salad dressing."
870705,285530,2010-11-03,5,"Wonderful!  I made it just as the recipe states and it""s warm and comforting.  Great without the ice cream!"
949443,37964,2008-11-26,1,"This recipe was an absolute disaster. I followed the recipe and quantities exactly and I ended up with a thick stodgy dough.  The dough itself was tasteless and unappealing. I thought I could resurrect it by cooking it like damper, but it was only fit for feeding to the dog."
123220,105766,2004-12-13,4,Everyone liked this a lot. I used a lot more herbs. I winter over my herbs under lights and the oregano was getting out of hand.
20480,72044,2009-11-26,5,"These are great & easy to make;used to make these with my kids. I have been looking all over for the recipe.Thanks for posting; will be making them next weekend with my grandchildren.
Rita"
1058097,226305,2010-03-30,5,"It may sound weird, but it certainly doesn't taste weird!  This a very creamy, savory dish.  Three eggs may be too many for 1 serving, but that can be adjusted to suit.  I like the idea of adding some cooked veggies, and my try that next time.  Thanks for posting!  Made for Bargain Basement Tag."
302689,305733,2010-06-28,2,"I'm really sorry Mulligan. This just didn't work for us. It seemed like this recipe was trying to be so many things at the same time. Ultimately, the addition of banana made it hard to eat because it felt like I had combined dinner and dessert. Made for ZWT 6 Zingo (Voracious Vagabonds)"
2085008,55977,2011-12-31,5,Simply simple and delicious. I can't believe how much the spinach and mushroom sauce tasted like alfredo sauce. I'm vegan so I substituted the milk with almond milk. Oh and I used whole wheat pasta instead. Delicious!!
67026,105264,2008-12-26,5,"Delish!  I also used chipotle in adobob sauce, about 2 T.   I was trying to keep it mild for the family, next time I'll add more.  Great addition to my southwest-themed christmas dinner, thank you for a keeper!"
2000555289,171703,2016-12-23,5,These are great!!! Just like my granny use to make. Thank you Lavern
1800170572,346196,2013-10-30,5,"I made this yesterday with some slight alterations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I made a half portion, as I only cook for my girlfriend and I. I couldn&#039;t find New Mexico Red Chilis (or powder), so I used ancho chili powder instead. I found this in the &quot;premium&quot; spice section at my grocery store (the glass jar spices).  It took the whole bottle.  If you make a full serving, you will need two of those bottles.  I used Boston butt (pork shoulder) as the cut of meat.  Lastly, I used an electric slow-cooker instead of the oven, cooking it for about 5 hours total while I did other things.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was REALLY good.  Served it up with some refried beans and corn tortillas. The pork was delectable. I think browning it with the onion and garlic juices before roasting it really adds to the flavor..  And I can&#039;t speak for New Mexico chilis, but the ancho chili powder gave it a very robust, smokey flavor. The one thing I will say, is that with the cut of meat I chose, it was really greasy.  I would recommend skimming off the oil that rises to the top as it cooks.   I plan on making this again soon. It was easy and so tasty."
311926,56804,2009-01-04,5,"I just adore this recipe and make it every chance I get!! I don't add the strawberries, jelly or powdered sugar just because I'm lazy and I like it just fine that way. I use french toast sticks and accidentally got 1 regular pkg  and one cinnamon and didn't realize it till I started cutting up the cinnamon ones. I threw them in and it actually added a nice flavor. I wouldn't do half and half but I will definitely add some cinnamon pieces again next time. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!"
6357,20093,2002-11-26,4,"A very rich dish, must say and tasty too with the perfect amount of spices. I made this many many days back and forgot to post the review. I did use 1 1/4 cups of breadcrumbs to bind the ingredients of the neatballs together. Other than that, it was perfect and very tasty with hot rotis and white Basmati rice."
309967,95222,2006-09-08,5,Yum-yum for real!!! I baked my two pork chops for 45min. The sauce was wonderful. Will make it again.
67270,228028,2009-06-07,3,"I used the veggies in the fridge (broccoli, onions, sweet peppers) and pork loin pieces. I also used rice noodles instead of rice. The result was okay; I wasn't so crazy about the sauce."
231507,286575,2012-03-11,5,"You can't get any simpler than this for a good chocolate frosting. DGD and I made brownies and frosted for St. Patrick's day. DGS's helped with the sprinkles and of course, the tasting. All approved!!!"
611409,221594,2007-12-06,5,Almost as good as my grandmother used to make. It reminds me of her potato salad except she always added fuji apple slices. I made it without the chicken stock powder and it was fine.
60716,4199,2008-01-14,5,"These were great! I made these to have with tonight's burgers. They have really good flavor, we are spice lovers and these worked out perfectly."
542518,11217,2007-07-22,5,"YUMMY!!!!!!!!  I gave away my first batch to friends and family and they are already bugging me for more!!  I made a ""secret"" batch just for me and my family--my 3 year old even loves it!  Thanks for the recipe!"
782723,336205,2014-01-04,5,"love the pic of your cat, looks like ours ;-)   But now to your roast.     sooooo good.   Couple neg reviews you got about taste...... don&#039;t fret.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;fishers of recipe&#039;s should always know that if you don&#039;t like the taste of garlic, you are not going to like what it does to any dish.    I hated garlic when I was young also but later on in life I love it and now gravitate to dishes that include it.   And it keeps bad ju ju away from you.   I wonder if that is my breath that does that?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your roast recipe is a keeper in the recipe book above the stove.with your others.     Thanks"
813629,95842,2008-04-09,5,"This was very good and easy to make.  I love the flavor of the feta topping.  Very unique and flavorful.  I made the recipe exactly as is, including the wine.  I will definitely make again.  Even hubby raved about it.  I wouldn't change a thing."
44192,24306,2002-06-17,5,This has just an excellent flavor. We used red and green pepper strips in it and everyone loved it. The pineapple is wonderful with the sauce.
706608,331989,2009-04-08,5,This sauce is phenominal! I can't even tell you how happy I am with this. After transferring to the serving bowl I just stood at the stove scraping the skillet lol Made exactly as directed. The peas add a nice sweetness. The spices are PERFECT. And it was easy to whip up. Thank you!
464080,397744,2010-03-20,5,"Awesome!  I made this for a baby shower last night and it was so stinkin' fancy!  Love it!  I made it as written, but without the grapes as I forgot them at home. . .bummer.  The mint really made them look pretty and smelled great!  Thanks for sharing."
2000068357,28768,2015-03-23,4,"Made this last night after reading tons of positive and negative reviews. I used ground turkey and sausage, doubled the sauce, added 4 table spoons of red wine, and a few pinches of sugar. Sauce was amazing! Oh, I also used canned San Marzano tomatoes. I made one huge pan and used leftover sauce to make mini spaghetti squash lasagnas. So good! I loved this basic recipe for non cooks like me."
464080,275334,2009-05-08,5,"I mean really, how could you give these any less than 5 stars?!?!?!?  Great tasting and super easy.  I cut the recipe in half and used a smaller baking dish.  I also used Splenda in place of the sugar to decrease on calories and it worked like a charm; I may even use half the Splenda next time.  I used half the amt of butterscotch chips, melted them and smeared them over the treats, then melted half the amt of choco chips and did zig zags over the top.  Next time I am going to throw the butterscotch chips whole into the cereal mixture and then drizzle just the chocolate on top. Thanks for a keeper!"
37449,227732,2010-06-23,5,"Yum, very much enjoyed today! A sweet dressing that I liked. Thanks! Made for Family Picks for ZWT#6."
60031,12921,2009-12-09,4,"My husband stated this was the best *censored* chicken he'd had in  a long time.  It was good to me too, but not spectacular.
However, it was simple, fast and gave me free time to worry about my side dishes."
140132,110047,2012-12-22,5,Oh what a delicious recipe.  I wanted something easy to make and use up some frozen cooked turkey and we chose your recipe.  I made exactly as written and we loved it.  My kids wouldn't want the added veggies into it so I served some on the side (they don't like alot mixed together).  Thank you for sharing with us.
649612,208486,2008-11-27,5,"These cupcakes are really good. I omitted the raisins and nuts and they came out really good. I also used grapeseed oil for improved flavor. Very good cake.

I really like the icing as well. Very rich and with a good cream cheese flavor. I didn't add as much sugar because I don't like overly-sweet frosting. I am making a batch for the second time right now. I upped the recipe to 36 cupcakes and they came out quite well."
57721,42673,2004-01-29,4,"Very good, I will however use margarine next time, it is hard to spread cold butter. Excellent taste."
1086570,446062,2011-01-13,5,"Wonderful and its sugar free. (not calorie free) It took me less than 20 minutes to make, You and your kids will love this pie. Its dense without being overly heavy. It is somewhat sweet  but not a bit of  false sweetness, Make sure you use a large enough container to mix  everthing together. (I did not). If you have someone with a huge sweet tooth this pie will fill the bill and not totally kill a diet."
424680,417181,2011-03-27,5,"Since I made this for just the 2 of us, I cut the recipe in half! We thoroughly enjoyed the Dijon mustard mix over this vegetable & will be making it again, next time for company! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!  [Made & reviewed for one of my adopted chefs in this Spring's Pick A Chef event]"
379572,212062,2007-06-22,4,i tried this and was good....i did add kosher salt the add to the taste.....morton salt company made this years ago then quit
12657,50201,2003-02-01,3,"The only change I made was in omitting the capers, which I didn't have. While this was an extremely healthy recipe (no oil!), it was a bit too sour for my liking. Somehow the peppers seemed to have absorbed all the sourness, while the pasta was more sweet. But I do like the concept of boiling peppers, and I'll probably use that technique often now! Thanks basia!"
200822,89177,2005-05-25,5,"Hubby and I both give this a big thumbs up!! My husband isn't a huge corn fan, so I was worried he wouldn't like it... he devoured 2 big bowls! I did it in the crockpot as directed but mine didn't take 6-8 hours. I started it at 10am and it was done by 1 (I taste tested- couldn't help it!).. everything was totally cooked through and hot. I know the newer crock pots cook hotter in a shoter amount of time so I'm guessing that was it :)  So I turned it to the warm setting for a few hours and it was perfect.  I did change 2 things - instead of adding the can of diced tomatoes, I ran it through my food chopped... so it kinda made crushed tomatoes :)  My hubs doesn't like tomato chunks.  I didnt have monterey jack on hand so I just used 2 cups of sharp cheddar.  I topped my bowl with sour cream and crushed tortilla chips... I'll be freezing the leftovers!! Thanks for the delicious recipe!"
742667,151089,2008-04-17,5,We loved this recipe. I did add a cup of frozen blueberries. Great way to add fiber too our diets!
2000431901,434019,2016-03-24,5,"Like other reviewers, I cut the mayo quantity in half. I also used leftover turkey instead of chicken. I used a sourdough baguette which made nice little sandwiches, and an aged white cheddar. These were SO good!!!"

Perhaps you meant another more reasonable amount ?"
452355,424870,2013-12-01,5,"Really easy as well as being hearty and flavorful.  We really enjoyed this soup.  Like another reviewer, I added more coriander and cumin for extra flavor.  I would make this again.  Thanks!"
444132,401607,2010-05-14,5,"These are really wonderful bars! Simple to make, too. I was a little worried about the microwaving of sweetened condensed milk, because of prior reviews, but found that following the tips given (use a large bowl, cook an extra two minutes, don't worry if it doesn't look perfect when it's done, whisk it and it will be perfect), worked perfectly! Also - score/mark the bars by sliding a knife through the chocolate layer once it sets, then chill - then the chocolate doesn't streak through the other layers when you cut through. Fantastic recipe, Gailanng - thanks for sharing it! Made for 1-2-3 Hits Tag."
254415,192298,2006-10-25,5,I made this with frozen raspberries which I pureed and strained. I first enjoyed these treats during a visit to Washington State and have been waiting for a recipe to make them at home. I substituted Splenda for half the sugar and they turned out perfect. These are addictive and are a wonderful gift for the holidays.

These were amazing!!!! I made two batches in one bowl (what was I thinking?) and I used all of the sugar for the recipe and not for the outside, so my mom and I used a mix of; cinnamon, brown sugar, and vanilla, and it turned out amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2011420,87775,2011-09-19,5,"Thank you! My Greek husband loves Tsoureki. His YaYa and aunt made it for him all the time when he was little. Today, I made this recipe and he loved it! You made me a tsoureki making star with these easy to follow instructions."
142367,71273,2007-07-09,5,"At first, I wasn't going to give this one 5 stars, but then I tasted the sauce the next day -- excellent!  Letting the sauce sit in the frig makes a huge difference.  I have used the sauce in Easy Way Lasagna #18888 with great results and will try it on my homemade pizza and in Pepperoni Casserole #110024.  Thanks for the recipe Kittencal.  P.S.  I thought my family might have a fist fight over the last meatball!"
780028,321179,2009-02-13,5,"This is a great lunch time or light dinner pizza option, so fresh tasting and different!  I used this topping on a homemade thin crust and doubled the amount of pepper flake, as we like things a little spicy.  I followed the recipe exactly except just a little less onion and I used dried basil and oregano and sprinkled generously!"
135887,3180,2009-09-12,5,The best!
486725,425626,2012-08-06,5,"Delicious pizza, the brussels sprouts are really the star here. I did make some modifications - subbed goat cheese/prosciutto and used less, and baked at 450. I am glad I did, the brussels sprouts would have completely burned (unless maybe you added them just the last few minutes?). I would also probably use 3 garlic cloves next time. This pizza really is a great combo, definitely worth making again."
124190,103966,2009-01-05,5,"Great recipe, especially for our two-diet home! DH is doing Weight Watchers, and I am South Beaching. This recipe works great for both! I did use a lot more salsa than called for, and added more cheese to mine. I used light pepper-jack for my piece. YUM! Thanks!"
305531,427482,2013-08-11,5,So simple and so good. A really nice side dish that would go well with so many things. Thanks iewe for sharing. Made for ZWT9.
456799,37393,2008-02-06,5,"Excellent! So easy and delicious. The meat was so tender I had to use an electric knife to slice it so it wouldn't fall apart while cutting. I didn't have any liquid smoke so I wasn't sure how it would turn out. I marinated it in the fridge for a day and half, using dark guiness beer in place of the smoke. It turned out perfect even with out the smoke. The only way to cook a brisket! Update... I have made this several times since and with the liquid smoke or with the beer it is always wonderful. Sometimes I leave off the barbecue sauce if I am not in the mood for the sweetness and it is still scrumscious and still the only way to cook a brisket!"
271119,151614,2006-02-21,5,This is so good and easy.  My husband loved it.  Adjusted for 2 people so I can use the stuffing mix 3 times with one box.  Thank you so much!
626096,257794,2008-05-27,5,Everyone raved about this recipe. I used half sugar and half Splenda with excellent results. Thank you so much for posting! Reviewed for ZWT 4.
351446,4312,2007-11-09,5,Excellent! Will cook again
523665,49232,2008-11-15,5,"I make this for my girls (1 & 4) at least once a week, we call it ""Tubby-Toast"" as in the Teletubbies. They both love it and can't get enough. The only modification is that we use a cinammon raising bread. It greatly enhances the flavor. I guess I know what they'll be having next time we go to Disney."
10255570,11345,2015-12-22,1,"I did follow the steps and didn&#039;t add anything. It was awful, it tasted like nothing and like something was off at the same time.
Then again I can and do burn brownies from the box..."
61660,60877,2007-05-30,4,"Easy to put together!  I used about 4 bananas to get the 1 1/2 cups mashed.  I baked for one hour and the top was a bit too brown but the inside was really moist. I may add a little more lemon zest next time too.  I could really taste it in the batter, but not as much baked.  Overall a great tasting bread and I was able to get it in the oven within 10 minutes."
135470,446975,2011-10-09,4,"These are simple and tasty, though with the time they take to bake. They aren't overly sweet but for my taste I would use less sugar. I would only use this method again if I had something else going in the oven too, as I get similar results from the microwave or on the stove top in much less time. I used them for a topping for french toast. Made for PAC Fall 2011."
553587,23312,2009-03-15,4,"I've been making a vanilla version of this for many years.  For those who said to use less milk, I'm guessing that you didn't cook the milk mixture long enough.  It should be sort of like glue.  If you are gluten-free, this also works with corn starch--try 3 T.  For some reason, while this recipe works, I prefer to put the sugar with the butter and cream for about 8-10 minutes.  The granular sugar will disappear; I like the texture it provides to the frosting.  Last, you can substitute chocolate; I used milk chocolate tonight and it was delicious.  I only used 1 T of cocoa to keep it from getting to dark tasting.  I used 3/4 c sugar, as the recipe says.  If I were making it with semi-sweet, I might want to go with 1 cup."
136997,395145,2009-12-31,5,I don't think I have to pay the high price of Naan ever again. Very easy to produce. I didn't need all of the flour in the end and I also skipped the last two ingredients. Baked them on my baking stone as well. I shaped them into ovals. They make really nice pizzas too. Thank you for posting it. :)
134027,86691,2004-03-20,5,yummy! VERY easy to make... almost impossible to screw up :) awesome how it puffs up. and it's all about the powdered sugar on top :)
299591,30360,2009-08-04,5,"My family loved it.  They only want me to make steak like this from now on.
Thanks for the great recipe."
126418,37413,2007-03-17,5,What a great meal! I'm quite sure my mom made something similiar to this when I was growing up. My husband was certainly happy with it! I imagine I will be making this quite often! Thanks for the keeper!
1219343,355130,2010-03-28,5,"I've been doing this for a few years now and have gotten a few friends to try it, too!!  It's so nice to be able to cook up a supply of bacon for the freezer with little or no mess to clean up. And the strips stay flat instead of curling up like they do in the frying pan.  BLT's aren't such a chore to make anymore!!  Only problem for me is........I know that all that yummy bacon is in the freezer and I tend to snack on it more often than I should!!!"
352538,351440,2009-03-04,5,"Excellent soup.  I didn't have a jalapeno so used a chipotle instead.  Very nice amount of heat.  I only had blackstrap molasses and it is a bit obvious in the taste so next time will use the fancy molasses or some other sweetener.  As another reviewer said, the amount of cinnamon is just right.  I wouldn't use any more.  Thanks!"
410352,9836,2007-09-14,5,"My whole family enjoys it very much, we always eat the whole thing. Very easy to prepare as well."
496803,37639,2012-08-27,4,"I liked these, but I didn't really love them.  The green sauce is really nice, and worth the work that went into making it.  I didn't care for the texture of the corn tortillas, they just kind of fell apart and turned mushy.  I also felt that it needed a bit more flavor; some cumin sprinkled on top fixed that.  I'd make these again, using flour tortillas and adding some cumin to the chicken.  Made for ZWT8."
190421,3470,2007-10-14,4,"Very nice.  I used stovetop stuffing mix, but next time I'll do my own with just some sage and rosemary.  Found it to be a little too salty with the stuffing mix.  Planning on leaving out the butter for this reason as well."
7108,8626,2002-03-27,5,"These are excellent!!!  In the 29 years I have been alive I have never cared for green beans, but after tasting this recipe I am very much into green beans!"
233495,5297,2010-10-06,3,"So sorry to ruin the star rating, but this was just okay for us.  It wasn't too spicy or too sweet - we just didn't like the combination of flavors with the chicken.  It was certainly not bad!  It just wasn't one of our favorites and probably will not be made again in our house.  Thanks anyway for sharing the recipe!  :)"
2001315189,384069,2016-12-23,5,Amazing !!!!!!! So easy yest so yummy!!!!! Best I have ever had !! I'm going to try make pandan and a lemon curd batch next!!!
1260605,264604,2009-08-20,0,"delicious, I used 'cubed' chicken rather than minced and add a little bit more of Soy sauce than what the recipe calls for.  Today I added juice of 1 lime it gave the soup a nice touch.   Thanks."
377039,52253,2009-03-04,0,"I made too many changes to give a star rating. This was pretty good. I increased the veggies quite a bit and added a little diced potato as well. I forgot the garlic. I made the dumplings, dropped one in to see how it would taste and it puffed beautifully and tasted great.  Dinner was about two hours away so I let them rest until shortly before serving time, then dumped them all in and boiled. These didn't puff up at all and were very dense (because they'd rested? Because the soup was overcrowded? I don't know).  It was pretty tasty but I didn't enjoy the texture of the dumplings.  The soup had a faint, bitter aftertaste. I'm not sure what I did to cause that, but I am sure it was my fault and not the recipe's.  This did get rave reviews, but I wasn't wow'd by it. I may try again. It did smell fantastic!"
281701,109297,2006-08-25,5,"Yum!  Used the vegetable broth option, and canned pumpkin.  The parmesan cheese really makes this taste so good!  Thanks!!"
354150,31230,2008-01-29,4,"Great basic recipe.  I personally don't like a ton of sugar in baked goods, so I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  Also added about a cup each of chopped dried apricots and dark chocolate chips.  Might have just been the added apricot and chocolate but next time I make this I will use even less sugar, probably a cup, as the biscotti was still a bit sweet for me.  Also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract."
174096,137164,2011-06-09,5,Very nice!  This is refreshing and easy to make.  It was great alongside a curry dish.  Thanks for sharing!  Veg*n Swap 35
237123,127295,2005-10-10,5,Yumm.. this was great. I used Spanish rice and also topped with sauteed onion and bell peppers (before the cheese).  Fantastic.  Thank you for this recipe.
25792,33489,2006-07-05,5,"I dont like coleslaw but was requested to bring some to a picnic.  This was what I brought and an empty bowl was what I brought home. I changed nothing and my DBF's father could not get enough of it and was scraping the bowl for more!  That says it all as he is a picky person...Thanks Sharlene, I dont have to look any further for coleslaw!"
268955,138239,2007-12-24,5,"My search for a beef and noodles recipe is over!  I have been looking for something that my family likes for 3 years, and this is definitely it.  I made the recipe with half of the meat, but doubled the onion and mushrooms.  It was wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
220023,208554,2007-10-06,5,cool
8688,251229,2007-11-28,4,"Loved this combination!  Very pretty, too!  Thanks, Jen!"
394902,106363,2006-11-26,2,"Not as flavorful as we expected. We could taste the cinnamon and walnut. We only let it marinate for an hour and a half. If we remade it, I would let it sit overnight. I would have used more than 2 cups crumbled cornbread. Save the remaining, uncrumpled cornbread and eat it with the meal. I like how it was different and the ease at which it was to prepare."
104295,70778,2003-11-07,4,"We used 1/2 whole wheat flour which, I'm sure contributed a bit to how heavy it was.  But it was quite tasty.  The rise time is very long, so plan on just letting it sit.  But the kids love it (my 21 month old is walking around with a piece right now).  I'm  going to try to make it into french toast tomorrow.  Nice for dipping into stews."
280271,367952,2012-10-16,3,I was expecting great flavor with this dish...but it was on the bland side...I added lots of salt to perk it up and still it was missing flavor so I added in a couple of beef bouillon cubes...that did help it...I cut the recipe in half and it made enough for 6 people...I think cooking the ingredients in bacon fat would give it a burst of flavor...I really love cabbage and noodles cooked together but this time hubby wasn't impressed...
383346,152413,2012-02-20,5,I used a small onion and chicken broth.  The rice had a great flavor with the rosemary.  Thanks Ms*Bindy :)  made for cookbook tag game
424008,377848,2009-07-05,5,"OMGOSH!!! I found another awesome porkchop recipe (2 thumbs up)
Thanks for posting :)"
552613,423880,2010-06-03,4,It doesn't get much easier than this recipe! If you don't have the actual mango fruit around this is an easy fix to satisfy your sweet tooth while still being a healthy drink.  I used nearly fat free natural yoghurt and it worked just fine.  Made for vegetarian swap.
113894,43503,2007-09-04,5,"This is an excellent omelet.  It is light and fluffy and full of flavor.  This recipe was featured in the collectors issue of Taste of Home's Light & Tasty..and light it is!  It's easy to double the ingredients and use two pans so the whole family can eat at the same time! Thanks, Tootsie for posting..you saved me a bunch of typing!"
293410,224793,2008-01-10,5,"I love the mild spiciness of the rice, and the fresh juiciness of the tomato and peppers. Didn't have any parsley, so I added about 1 tsp. dried parsley flakes with the other spices. Also greatly reduced the salt. I'd like to add this is great at room temperature for my school lunches!!"
204452,372388,2013-05-12,5,Not sure why I haven&#039;t reviewed this recipe.  I have been using this recipe for almost 2 years and it is now my go to for pulled pork.  It is so simple and delicious.  In fact my mom loved is so much that I gave her the recipe and now it&#039;s her go to.  Make exactly as written.
440324,381325,2012-11-04,5,With red cabbage in season I've been trying out several recipes and so far this one was the biggest hit. I liked it because the recipe didn't call for sugar so the only sweetness came from the apples which was just perfect. Everyone else liked it just because it tasted great. Thank you.
359533,4957,2009-05-16,5,"This came out really well! I doubled the recipe, froze a ton of leftovers and had easy meals when I was too tired to cook! Yum."
480666,52251,2007-06-09,5,"the best tasting muffins! not too much flour, and a lot of apples.
next time I want to use 1/3 cup of sugar. very moist and soft muffins."
482376,235054,2010-01-06,5,"We LOVED this recipe. I must say upfront, that I used ground round instead of ground lamb, because that is what I had on hand. Next time, I will try it with ground lamb.  I used about a pound and a quarter of meat, so I increase the amount of chips that I used to about 3/4 of a large bag. These nachos were devine. I really loved the addition of the crushed tomatoes and Mexican chili beans, making this recipe special. The salsa fresca was the perfect meld of flavors and I especially liked it blended in with the mashed avocado. I have some of that mixture left over and will enjoy it with chips today. Yum!!"
20480,263619,2008-08-10,5,I guess it is wierd to rate a tomato sandwich but I had an urge.A beautiful ripe tomato was sitting on the counter begging to be a star. Turned out great. I made it for Healthy Choice tag game.So I used Whole wheat bread and light Becel ot make it a bit healthier; thanks for sharing this simple gem that gives great pleasure. Rita
383346,246849,2007-10-22,4,I did it for my mother and she didn't like it.  But she's not the type of person who likes to try drinks.  So I drank it.  I liked it cause I like rum.  It's a good drink when it's cold outside :)  Thanks Alia :)  Made for beverage tag.
356746,14960,2006-09-26,4,This is a good basic recipe for mandelbrot.  I found that you can add A LOT more than 1/2 cup filling.  I poured one whole cup of trailmix with raisins and it still felt like more could be added.  The best thing is - it's not too sweet. Thanks Mirj
122108,80137,2004-01-30,5,Excellent drink...  Perfect for dessert...
1116742,139499,2010-03-17,4,"This muffins were very good, but if you are looking for sweet these would not be what you are looking for. I used fresh cranberries which caused the muffins to be tart. I think next time I will try craisens instead. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
199848,264669,2007-12-10,5,"I loved that combination of flavors.... very autumn-y.  I have a similar recipe, but it's gets pureed.  I enjoyed this soup because it was not pureed and had chunkiness, but yet it had a thick, creamy texture.  I used fat free half and half for the milk.  Thanx for a great cold-weather soup!"
26278,26986,2002-05-02,5,"Lee-Ann,
What a delicate texture the cracker crumbs gave to the meatballs. I used salt instead of soy and it was fine. Lastly, served the meatballs over a bed of brown rice. Excellent recipe & thanks for posting.

(This was great because of variety of allergies,I am not allowed any bread or soy.)"
36127,50590,2004-06-29,5,"I made this in the crockpot and let it simmer for about 14 hours.  I browned it first and then just stuck it and the rest of the ingredients in there.  I thought it was very good, a little different but in a yummy way.  I used regular apple cider vinegar in it this time but plan to experiment with other vinegars such as white wine and balsamic.  I will make this often as we love roasts."
197788,111777,2013-12-11,5,"Great directions, great pot pie! I hate using canned cream of whatever soup, and this was truly homemade. My oven took about 40 minutes, but it&#039;s not a very good oven. Thanks for posting this recipe."
1028418,16546,2008-11-15,5,"Good food.
Any combination of beef, beans, potatoes, and onions has to be good.
Suggestion: use one whole onion, and add a can of chunky Ro-Tel.
Your friends who love spicy will pester you for this recipe."
52800,19279,2002-09-17,5,"This was a fantastic recipe. Just a few simple ingredients and it was easy to prepare. Great for those weekday evenings when you need a quick and tasty meal. I used a corn starch slurry to thicken the cream and onion soup mixture after I pulled the porkchops out, that's just a personal preference thing. The gravy was excellent served over the chops!"
243749,76610,2005-11-28,5,"I too saw her make this and went straight to the grocery store.

I serve this as the side with my manicotti, it has powerful flavors and is bold and tangy. It is really good stuff. I have made it several times and found no need to change the recipe."
540322,47641,2007-10-01,5,"This was very good. Like everyone else, I put my own spin on it: Velveeta instead of cheese spread, and roasted garlic mushroom soup instead of plain. My condensed milk looked very ""off,"" so I just used regular milk. Even with all my changes, this one's a keeper!"
759159,355506,2014-08-03,5,"This is an absolutely amazing recipe!! I have tried making this garlic sauce SO many times and it always turns out great! I followed the exact recipe with a few minor changes that I read from other reviewers. I first placed the garlic in the food processor and chopped it up, then I added the lemon juice, salt, &amp; egg whites. I let those ingredients blend, then I slowly added the corn oil from the top until I used all 3 cups. It turned out great!"
199848,224710,2010-11-23,5,"This is a wonderful way to use leftover turkey.  I love that it's got lots of broccoli in it.  I added some onions, but that's all I did differently.  Nice and easy to make.  Loved it.  Thanx!"
771965,193354,2012-08-23,4,I think this was good. I wasn't completely thrilled about the outcome but my husband raved about how he liked it. I will try again to make it. Overall the flavor was good for me. I used it as a bread for lunch.Thanks.
1048179,42901,2011-08-29,4,"I really enjoyed this recipe, it was easy and the texture of the cheesecake was perfect. The white chocolate flavor got lost under the raspberry and oreo flavors though. Next time I might sub more chocolate and use a subtler graham crust. Thanks!"
363806,23779,2007-11-10,5,"Excellent ""weekender"" dish.  It came out perfect.  I too used some BBQ sauce with the catsup.  The end result is wunderbar.  This will last me until Tuesday at least.  Absolutely delicious."
11464,39745,2006-05-22,4,"Great recipe for crab cakes without any fillers!!! Only thing I would do next time is decrease the salt to about 1/8-1/4 tsp as there is already salt added from the worsterchire sauce and the saltines. Otherwise, a great recipe!"
89831,178153,2006-10-19,5,"Oh yum the is so good, I left it to chill overnight and the flavors really seemed to come alive, great recipe hon!...Kitten:)"
2385525,75531,2012-09-01,0,Used to work at little Caesars a couple years ago. If you want real copy cat crazy bread coat the bread after it comes out of the oven with the butter and cheese. That's how the real bread is done :)
85873,31833,2004-02-08,5,"Made this to take to a party. Was well received. Quick to make, easy to transport. Thanks Elaine."
212032,116205,2008-01-22,5,"I wanted to find this recipe for a long time.  I like pork instead of gamier meats, which worked well in this recipe.  Thanks for posting, we ate it with kittencal's latkes, yummy!"
209747,144673,2006-05-10,5,So easy and tasty! These are not bland at all. I did add 1 garlic clove to the tomato-herb-cheese mixture. I will be using this to impress people in the future- definitely! Thanks NC for another great recipe- makes me look really good!  
207375,61857,2005-11-05,4,"I left my bundt pan at my mom in laws, so I made it in a cake pan, very cool citrus flavor, great for summer, but not that great for fall or winter.  Thanks for the recipe."
87308,50875,2003-05-25,5,"Outstanding. Made it last night for dinner, to rave reviews. I'm serving at my mom's group meeting this week. Also loved your Carrot Tofu Miso dressing recipe."
330505,281771,2008-11-06,5,"WOWOWOW!!  Fantastic recipe and amazingly YUMMY!  As others have stated, I could eat the whole pan myself.  Made as directed, except I used tenders instead of breasts.    Thanks SO MUCH for posting!!  Made for Potluck Tag Game."
80353,161439,2006-04-08,5,"Oh my!  My new favourite !WOW! dessert.  Definitely not as complicated as it might sound too some (the first 3 instructions are for peeling the oranges properly).  I used 4 naval oranges and 4 blood oranges, as Kate suggested and it was gorgeous even before I completed the dish.  I loved the citrusy-sweetness of the oranges and creaminess of the gratin.  The almonds were the perfect topping - adding their flavour and crunch.  A delight in every way - texturally, visually and definitely full marks for flavour.  This really should get more stars."
53425,21120,2004-12-29,5,"Perfect! This is a wonderful combination. It's a slow dish to make, but very easy. Into my ""regular"" cookbook it goes! "
54678,277175,2008-03-19,5,This was great but next time I will use the firm ricotta cheese and the parm. I had asiago cheese and loose ricotta so I just mixed it all together and formed a ball which spread during cooking but was still great. It didn't say how much salt and pepper so I used the measurement of the chili flakes and my friends thought it was too peppery but I LOVE PEPPER and that is what counts most. Next time I'll do it to taste.
1803035838,60339,2014-08-15,2,"Really easy and about as healthy as it gets, considering it&#039;s just meat, seasoning, and a couple of veggies...  But it&#039;s SO BLAND.  This recipe is just not for me."
206747,43507,2007-02-04,4,"One of those ""what do I have, that I don't have to go out"" nights. Made almost as directed, but added Hot sauce to the meat mixture, and sliced a shallot that was sitting around. It was very tasty - using spices I would not have thought to combine.  Would probably make a good base to add other favorite ingredients.  Thanks CChick."
356738,58823,2007-05-02,3,"It was good, but I used regular polish kielbasa. Maybe the dish would be better, if indeed I would use smoked instead."
11176,234608,2009-01-21,0,"I can see how this would be a really good substitute for ""All Things Evil"" in regular pie filling, but I think I flubbed up, so I won't rate it right now.  I don't have a lot of experience cooking desserts and the like. I followed the directions to the letter, but I think I didn't let it thicken enough. I ended up adding more cornstarch/water.  I'm afraid my photo depicts the jello-like consistency I achieved which, because of too much cornstarch, rendered the flavor ""off"". My fault.  I do want to get this down, though, so I'll try again. Thank you for posting, MUSEconnie!"
19198,18066,2002-12-30,5,"Excellent...the sauce is really yummy.  I will try another type of beef.  Used round steak but I didn't think it was tender enough, didn't stop my husband and son from finishing this dish.  I used 3 beef bouillons with 1 1/2 c. of water.  Definitely will be a favorite in this kitchen!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!"
395981,185409,2009-06-24,5,My Grandmother gave me this recipe years ago & is on our menu at least once a month.  Tasty & easy

797714,445240,2012-03-25,0,"Tried 4 different recipes for mug cakes and all of them had to much the taste of egg in them, so when a saw this one with no egg decided to try it. My kids loved this one, they tried all the other recipes and this one got 3 thumbs up!! they loved it so much, they want it for dessert tonight again and with this being low cal and low fat i really don't mind them having it again today. Thanks for sharing!!"

364838,200504,2008-12-27,5,FANTASTIC!!! Super Simple and yet SOOO good! I made this tonight on the side.  Would make again and again.  Thanks so much Cooking in Cairo for another winning recipe!  Keep'em coming!
125808,37968,2004-12-28,4,"I used frozen chicken tenders and shredded mexican cheese blend for this recipe but otherwise made it pretty much as directed, and served with rice.  Our guests loved it and had seconds etc.; I thought it was good and it sure was easy to make.  Thanks!"
254614,38238,2007-11-23,5,"Delicious!I used my homemade applesauce. This is a keeper! I used crushed walnuts instead of pecans, they are too expensive here. Great recipe."
83093,137328,2006-06-28,5,Even my professed green bean haters ate these! I made just as written & the orange flavor was perfect.  Thanks for posting thsi!  I'll definitely be making again!
86855,58879,2005-01-27,5,"We loved this recipe! It was a very pretty dish, and flavorful enough that it was good over plain white rice. I will definitely make this one again! :) "

473597,135350,2009-04-23,5,"Just made this for a friend with a death in family, it is the creamiest that I have ever made. Also the easiest came togther in under 10 min.  Very decadent I used half and half and 2% milk and then made 3 more batches for my Freezer,  Thanks."
1072593,96635,2013-03-07,5,I made this just too easily.  I feel so cheap. :-)  *Recipes Without Photo's Tag*
227652,109880,2006-02-28,5,"I LOVED these waffles. The big difference is that I added 1/4 cup mini choc chips to the batter & it was wonderful! I use applesauce for the oil, Eggbeaters, skim milk & Splenda. They were great! I baked them for about 7 min to get them crunchy, the way I like them. Thanks so much!!! "
827835,130623,2011-03-05,5,Very nice frosting! Lovely and light with just the right sweetness.  Yummmmmmmmy
1800183309,17186,2013-11-03,5,I followed a reviewer&#039;s past suggestion and doubled the salt and cheeses and melted with the butter and milk in a pot.  I mixed with the macaroni and topped with the other half of cheeses.  It turned out great!  It&#039;s a great dish for thanksgiving.
80219,90080,2006-10-08,5,This was excellent.  I used quite a bit more cooked chicken to increase the protein and added a can of black beans.  I sprinkled Franks Hot Sauce on my servings.  Will make often.
1803549484,274815,2014-12-23,5,"I used to be cooking it for so long time before I got my multicooker called Redmond M4500... &lt;br/&gt;God, it is so tasty and easy to make! Main thing is that its fast and I don&#039;t have to watch it. Also I am using fresh cranberries for this dish. Delicious!"
611494,16211,2007-12-15,5,"LOVE THIS RECIPE!  (And will never make regular Banana Bread again.)  My husband is a diabetic so I used Splenda instead of sugar and used ""I cannot believe its not butter fat free"", egg beaters and also added 1 tsp vanilla.  I doubled the recipe and made a bunch of muffins and hid them in the freezer thinking they would last longer, boy was I wrong!  I only got two of them and the rest were gone with in a week my family could not stop eating them!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe."
1253556,39646,2010-02-10,5,"amazing! made half batch.. bad idea  wanted to eat all of them in one night! added chocolate chips also 
good find"
1605194,139488,2010-04-26,5,"I would love to know the origin of your recipe! My husband's grandmother used to make the same recipe, but with peppers, in addition to the onions. Love it!"
171790,240807,2008-08-23,5,These tortillas were quite simple to make and impressed DD and DH. Fresh and homemade is so much better than store bought. When I make them again I may increase the recipe so that I'll have some leftover to freeze. Made for Vegetarian/Vegan Recipe Swap
35751,54112,2005-03-31,0,Wonderful taste and it was soooo easy to make.  If you are ever in a time crunch this is the fish to make.  I highly recommend it.
1622285,269092,2010-05-26,0,"This was truly the easiest cinnamon rolls on earth. My grandson (11) and I made these last night and we made them this morning. We forgot to grease the pan so we had a little bit more of a mess, but not a major problem. We probably will never purchase the pre-package again. Thanks for the recipe"
389712,194283,2006-12-18,5,This dish was wonderful.  I realy enjoyed the flavor.  It was a nice change from the normal fried pork chop.
2001780798,101839,2017-11-06,5,"Mouthwatering, delicious, scrumptious, yummy, finger-lickin good!"
239758,223897,2008-02-11,4,"I made this for Friday night drinks at work. Reactions were mixed and reflected people's preferences regarding broccoli and wasabi. Lovers loved it (count me in that group), and the others were polite. I didn't have powdered wasabi, so used almost a tablespoon of pre-mixed wasabi. I added it a teaspoon at a time to get the taste I thought the powder would give. My ricotta was quite dry, so I added almost 1/4 cup of milk to thin the mixture to a dip consistency. If you are a fan of the ingredients, this dip is wonderful. Thanks Leslie."
46545,17031,2002-10-05,5,"Thankyou!  Thankyou!
I don't like too much mayo, either.  This was perfect.  I used low fat cream cheese, used 1/2 the amount of cream cheese and sour cream, and substituted 1/2 the cheddar and jack with a veggie cheddar jack cheese blend.  I realize mine was a bit thicker because of this but hey, more stayed on my crackers!!"
173579,405033,2012-12-28,5,This pie was totally delicious.  My whole family really enjoyed it.  Thanks for posting.
860079,160537,2009-08-11,5,"This was a very nice recipe for what I would call ""home made baked beans"" ~ at least, that's what the flavors reminded me of. I made these in the crock-pot as I was pressed for time and served them to DH with homemade cornbread ~ he was a HAPPY MAN :) Thanks for posting, made for IRON CHEF AUGUST 2009."
281665,141789,2006-02-22,5,"Very easy, quick and yummy.  Kids and hubby loved it!!  "
2000693138,429768,2015-11-19,5,"I did tweak the recipe a bit, it still turned out so yummy! I saut&eacute;ed the onions in with a bunch of butter and onion powder. I mixed the milk in with the velveeta cheese block in a separate pot so it melted without burning, then mixed all the ingredients together. I used 1 can of the combo cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup and a can of celery soup. I put a little sharp cheddar cheese on top so when it bakes it comes out pretty ?"
573325,443144,2011-11-04,4,"This spread is nice and chunky with great nut and date flavours. The spices complemented each other and the remaining ingredients nicely, but were a bit strong for our taste. A tad less ginger would have been perfect for us. Since there are so many dates in here, we skipped the sugar. THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this lovely recipe with us, Paula!<br/>Made and reviewed for the Aussie/NZ Recipe Swap November 2011."
154379,32290,2004-08-06,5,"absolutly awsome sauce,perfect for ribs,bbq chicken...puts a nice heat on yur lips ....LOVE IT!!!
THANKS SOOO MUCH "
2000203533,133902,2017-06-26,5,"With just small adjustments making the sauce this really becomes a 30-minute meal. My husband loved the flavors of pineapple, onion &amp; sausage enhanced by the sweet &amp; sour sauce."
452940,425525,2011-05-02,4,"We love pickled cucumbers and this is a super easy recipe. I thick sliced my cukes as that is how we like them. I added some dill and garlic to the brine as our first taste (yesterday) was a bit bland. Worked like a charm. We sometimes do a medley of cukes, tomatoes (quartered), and sliced onion for a mini-salad. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Made for PRMR"
2383576,179522,2014-02-21,4,"Two stars as written, four with my adjustments. 1) ADD SALT. 2) Jack up the pepper a bit. I doubled, then doubled again. 3) Instead of paprika, use a teaspoon of mustard powder or a tablespoon of dijon mustard. With those changes, this was a great base mac and cheese recipe, one I&#039;ll definitely play with to make variations like buffalo chicken mac and cheese or bacon ranch."
220348,355889,2009-03-29,5,"This was a really good recipe, and I made an apple chuntey with raisins, and it went really well with this recipe. I also used mild curry so it wouldn't over power the taste of the cheese."
260679,28148,2008-06-10,5,"This was a big hit with my family and a recipe my husband said to ""please"" make again! The tortillas came out of the oven crispy and the filling was delicious. I love recipes that are versatile, when you can use a variety of ingredient combinations -- and this one is a great example. Next time I think I'll use beef, or maybe I'll add some black beans. This would be great to make ahead then bake 30 minutes before dinnertime. Love it!"
2795674,369849,2013-04-22,3,"Prepared as as in the recipe.  There was WAY too heavy of a concentration of red pepper flakes - 1 tbsp is just too much for a recipe this size.  It overpowers the other flavors.  All in all, things were pretty good, but I&#039;ve had much better Shrimp Mozambique.  Next time, I&#039;d probably cut this down to a teaspoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Portugese friend also assures me that lemon is commonly used in this dish.  Next time I try making Shrimp Mozambique, I&#039;ll definitely try something else."
581280,174276,2009-04-30,5,This was great!  I needed a quick dessert for company and it rec'd rave reviews!  I am now making it for the second time in less then a week because my mom requested it!  The recipe is quick and easy.  And taster wonderful!
724631,378033,2012-10-22,4,"Nice salsa, the sesame oil and rice vinegar weren't enough to impart a Thai feel to the dish, in our opinion, but it was a refreshing and healthy counterpoint to a guilty pleasure main dish.  Made for October 2012 Pick A Chef."
2865154,28667,2013-06-15,5,Was looking for something quick and yummy. Had all the ingredients but chose to also add some red bell pepper and sliced mushrooms. Really good and simple!
984155,102677,2009-12-22,5,WOW!!!! Yummy yummy yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmy! Thats all I have to say.
189643,182600,2006-11-10,5,"This deserves 5 stars for great flavor. It was a lot of onions to slice, but I stopped crying when I got to eat this! I sliced the meat very thinly and mixed it in the onions.  I realized afterwards that I misread the recipe-I only used one 2 1/2 lb. roast. Oops! It was very good though and I will make this again. Thanks!"
836822,32844,2009-12-21,5,So good and simple!!
526666,372574,2009-09-12,5,"It has been a long time since I made this; I forgot how easy it is and how GOOD! I had never tried a chocolate crust, so I did, and it was great! I used Nellie and Joe's key lime juice, as it is my fave and I did add 2 drops of green food coloring, personal preference...
Thanks for reminding me of this simple deliciousness, RBD, CBN!"
449929,36232,2008-03-09,3,"These were good.  Easy to make, I added craisins in addition to the raisins.  They were a little dry for our taste, but nice to know I can make a oatmeal cookie that is healthy!"
511151,60560,2007-07-03,5,Awesome!!
89831,129825,2006-11-29,5,"This soup is delicious! I also added in a couple tablespoons fresh minced garlic when sauteeing the onions and celery, I used butter in place of margarine and reduced it to 1/2 cup, I love this soup and plan on making it many times again, thanks for sharing Kitty!...Kitten :)"
175574,8507,2005-07-11,5,"Our Summer side dish staple once the tomatoes in the garden get ripe!

This is a perfect salad to showcase summer's freshest ingredients.  This is all about taking just a few REALLY GOOD ingredients and putting them together, nothing can be hidden or 'fudged' with this one.  Use your favorite extra virgin olive oil and if you can't get really ripe fresh tomatoes, dont' bother making it! Great recipe post Tish!  "
2404924,26370,2013-05-27,5,Yummy! I can&#039;t post a picture because we ate the cake so fast!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will be my go-to recipie for chocolate cake from now on.
1628373,25753,2011-01-12,5,Followed to a T! Surprisingly AMAZING!
2549237,134402,2016-09-24,4,"I made this tonight for dinner and my kids really liked it. I left out the onions, only because I didn't have a burner on my stove left to make them. I had an issue with the rice and lentils sticking to the bottom after the 25 minute cook time where it said not to touch them, I'm not sure if my heat was too high or something, but I wasn't terribly concerned about that, because we still had enough to feed everyone and I soaked the pan it and it came clean just fine. Thanks for an interesting way to use up some lentils that have been lingering in my kitchen for a while."
1689677,73166,2010-10-07,2,"Sorry just didn't do it for me, maybe it was that I used a crockpot ?I<br/>used 3 seeded jalapenos, and two cans of beans was plenty."
1052065,108527,2010-09-01,5,I made this minus the preserve since I didn't have any. I added extra honey and crushed red pepper too. Went very well with my egg rolls. Thanks for sharing Aroostook!!
156783,133106,2007-11-21,5,We have this for dinner quite often - my husband is always requesting it!  Very tasty and I always have the ingredients on hand.  Even my toddler likes it.
37779,49929,2003-03-23,5,"I know I was supposed to pick a recipe that hasn't been reviewed but I just had to try this. We love mushrooms and this recipe was awesome. We loved all the different herbs combined. Such great flavor!! Very easy and went well with roast beef and mashed potatoes. Stephanie, you have some terrific recipes and I am glad I picked you. Thanks!!"
355282,115208,2007-06-05,3,Hello I made this for the US regional category of World Zaar III. I did not have anaheim or pasilla chilies so substituted a tbs of Chipotle in adobo sause and 1 green chile. It was GOOD but lacked the depth of flavours others mentionned. But it looked very appetizing and was really easy to pull together...so I am going to keep my eyes out for the other peppers and try again!
242729,205504,2008-01-25,5,"Wonderful! I made this 3 weeks ago before I went to England, and it was nicely matured and mellow when I got back! The addition of the apricots makes this a VERY subtle marmalade and we loved the extra apricoty taste in addition to the normal tangy flavours of oranges and lemons. I managed to get 6 jars yield and I put aside a whole day for this - turn on your favourite music and relax whilst you chop, mince and stir!! A great recipe and now I am set up for a few weeks with my breakfast marmalade! Made for the Comfort Food Photo Tag game, 2008. Thanks NoraMarie for posting a keeper! FT:-)"
87023,19577,2003-05-23,4,An easier version of the lumpia is to substitute cooked prawns and roll in rice paper wrappers.  All else staysthe same just no cooking
1179225,384800,2009-08-17,5,"These came out great, almost addictive. Next time I'll use a little less kosher salt. I could not believe how great the house smelled while they were baking."
242929,312478,2008-07-16,5,This was so easy! It might be the best recipe I have ever tried! I added   turkey bacon and used fresh basil. I also used low fat wheat biscuit. I will make this over and over again. Thanks!
424680,51140,2010-01-20,5,"Made this the other day, then kept out enough for 2 of us before freezing the rest of it for another time or two ~ Just the kind of thing to have on hand when my vegetarian son & DIL are over for a meal! I expect to be making another whole batch just for freezing ~ Gotta be prepared for the next few cold months! Thanks, much, for another great keeper! [Tagged & made in Please Review My Recipe]"
37449,327077,2008-10-16,5,"This was a nice, tasty treat! I enjoyed the lemon and parsley flavors. I used fresh parsley. Thanks!"
866805,126086,2008-06-19,3,While easy to make and flavorful this recipe is way too sweet for my taste.
776876,24978,2009-05-15,5,"I really enjoy this bread! With the honey, it is a good combination of slightly sweet and hearty.  This has come out perfectly every time with no modifications."
37449,86178,2005-07-28,5,I had just about 2 cups of broccoli I needed to use up and this did the job wonderfully! I halved the dressing. Delicious! Thanks Barb!  :)
43514,3768,2004-07-22,5,"I share my finds on Zaar with a friend, and she's made this more than I have now.  We love this in the heart of winter.  And it makes our classroom smell great when we reheat it at school (we're both teachers)."
587766,304636,2008-06-04,4,i was really excited to try this recipe but it was a bit different for my tastes...my boyfriend liked it but said the warm dressing threw him off a bit.  i'm not big on sweets & a 1/2 cup sugar made this pretty sweet so i dont know if i'll be making this one again.  i made this for zwt4.
1028382,328828,2009-02-21,5,"Great recipe!  I honestly don't like mashed potatoes much or cream of chicken soup, but somehow all combined this was delicious!  The only substitute I made was using plain yogurt instead of sour cream, turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!  Like another reviewer said, would be a great meal to share with someone in need."
1142023,349848,2009-01-24,4,Easy to prepare. The flavors blend together very well.
932620,331112,2009-06-30,5,"Made these for a co-workers birthday and all the girlz at work are raving about them!  I made them into mini's (400F for 11 min.), omitted the chocolate chunks but used a low fat chocolate icing.  These are scrumptious!  Would definately make these again!"
208988,182386,2008-07-06,5,i just juiced the cucumber and did not add any sweetener or water. very refreshing!! will do this again :)
95044,12365,2003-09-12,4,Very good.  I will definitely use this recipe again.
350594,183828,2006-11-12,5,Awesome and easy to make!
129783,73166,2004-03-03,5,"the first time i made this was for a cookoff and it won first place!! (have to admit i didn't have a beer to put in, so it got left out!)  i have made the chili since then and i get rave reviews about it every time.  Amanda, thanks for sharing this great recipe- it's one i will use for many years to come."
122001,33489,2004-11-21,5,"I can't believe I didn't rate this, after making it.  I only used your ingredients, but had to adjust because I only had a 1/2 of head of cabbage left.  I used the taste method as you go.  Because of the reviews, it came out perfect.  I can't think of anything I'd do different."
283390,223844,2008-05-06,5,"Great salad! I used minced peperoncini instead of jalapenos (it was all I had on-hand), but otherwise followed the recipe closely. I don't think I would change a thing. This salad improves a LOT if you let it sit for a while, so make sure to give it a chance to ""rest"" in the refrigerator. Thanks for posting this!"
481494,217415,2007-04-20,5,"The name says it all! The best I've ever had. One word for it - amazing. I did it in the oven, so just imagine what it would be like on the grill."
223854,238729,2008-01-02,5,"Outstanding, we all really enjoyed these roasted pumpkin, the garlic flavour really adds a lot to the pumpkin.  The directions were perfect and they baked perfectly at 210oC for 30 minutes, nice and brown on the bottom and soft inside and crisp on top. Thank you busyozmum"
833434,88294,2010-09-25,1,"i'm sorry i totally disagree with the other reviews. these were complete soup until i added over a cup of breadcrumbs and they did not hold together at all before, during, or after cooking. moreover, they were very bland even though i added quite a lot more chili and jalapeÃ±o then called for. i might use kidney beans as a base for burgers again but not without a lot more binding agents and a heck of a lot more flavor. these were time consuming, annoying, and totally tasteless. will not make again."
216671,116236,2008-09-09,5,"Very very good!  I found it a little sweet, but DH loved it, and he doesn't even like cucumbers, ha ha! Subbed Splenda for sugar."
67395,67204,2004-08-08,5,This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  I bought some beautiful blueberries from a local farm and I wanted a recipe that would not overpower them.  I followed this recipe exactly and the muffins turned out beautifully and delicious!
879350,186363,2008-12-12,5,"I took these beautiful gems to a Christmas party last night and they were gone instantly! I made 1 1/2 times the recipe and used a 9 * 13 pan - I doubled the icing  as 1 1/2 wasn't quite enough.
Even my 5 year old who claims not to like coconut loved these!"
2000431901,444408,2016-06-09,5,This is amazing! Lots of flavor. The cornbread dumplings are wonderful.
2000250456,503781,2015-06-05,5,If i could give this 10 stars I would.  Throw all your other snickerdoodle recipes away. you will never use them again
225118,97297,2008-04-26,5,"Wow!  Just the recipe I was craving tonigh ~ thanks much!  This one is a keeper for sure and went great with my country fried pork chops, fried squash, & grandma's cornbread dressing - YUM-OH!"
2000369714,443987,2015-08-03,5,"I have been buying whatever Bruschetta I could find from various grocers in my areas but NONE sell anything decent tasting. I have been looking for the true and authentic Bruschetta I had when I was in Italy. I kept thinking it can&#039;t be that hard to find. Well, I finally gave up and decided to try making my own. I knew all I needed were fresh ingredients and a willingness to try. So, I grabbed some Basil from the garden and ran up to the store to buy everything else.  I succeeded and I do not even want to try other recipes! This was THE ONE I was looking for. I did use the small toastettes instead of the Baguette. Excellent recipe and it is now saved to my list. 

I will probably venture out when making it next time because I found by accident that Tomato Basil Soup added makes it another kind of awesome. ;-)"
59780,84957,2005-01-07,5,These are great meatballs! I amsurprised that they stayed together so well without any eggs. The spices and the seasoned breadcrumbs gave these a really good flavour. I made these during my Once A Month cooking blitz and they are now cooked and waiting in the freezer for a meal later this month. Thanks!
121185,385365,2010-06-22,5,holy gooey brownie goodness!!!  I used Trader Joes Gluten Free Brownie Mix and made 1/2 the tray without graham crackers due to a wheat intolerance.  Both versions were AMAZINGLY good.  I did struggle cutting them into squares as the marshmallow kept gunking up on the knife and getting all over the place.  Otherwise - WOW!
2000076772,134470,2015-03-29,5,"Was looking for something new for my Easter Brunch  - tested this and it&#039;s rock star !  I used pre-made pizza dough from local pizzeria.  Also made a version with smoked salmon, dill, chive, scallion and used goat cheese, ricotta and mozzarella - it was yummy too!  Look forward to serving it for Brunch next week!"
1072593,144179,2013-02-07,5,"The sky is falling...the sky is falling...the sky...""!!!  Just wanted to get your attention. You've run out of ideas not to make this.  Made for Best of 2012 recipe tag."
101823,210576,2007-08-24,4,"This is a lovely, simple soup with comfort food appeal.  I didn't have purple potatoes, but did have the purple cauliflower.  My husband prefers some texture to his soups, and I therefore didn't puree until fully smooth.  I omitted the drizzle of walnut oil, but served with toasted garlic asiago bread.  It was a rainy and cool day, and this was perfect, although unusually colored soup."
119997,11811,2004-01-14,4,"I'm always looking for new ways to sneak vegetables into our meals and this one was a hit, even with my two year old.  I used parmesan cheese as someone else suggested since that's what I had on hand.  Also left out the scallions to appease my picky husband.  Even good warmed up the next day (although a little soggy then)."
168462,134192,2008-07-14,4,Good and hearty recipe. My family really liked these. Thanks for the recipe.
204153,98493,2005-09-02,5,"Wonderful--our guests loved them. They are really good served on fresh green salads, too. Like oven-dried tomatoes, these have become a staple around here, and both are delicious salad toppings."
187128,11107,2007-04-27,1,"My family found these noodles to be gummy and pasty. They were flavorful, but we did not like the texture."
302094,39335,2010-05-11,5,"I needed a quick dinner last night, my 7 yr old asked for hamburger helper style dinner. So of course I turned to Zaar. This was wonderful. The only change I will make next time is to use 1 c. of dry pasta. I made a 1lb. box and it was way too much pasta. Great meal, fast to fix. Thanks for posting!"
340113,2496,2007-09-01,5,"Wow.  This is the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever used - and I have tried a fair few.  I didn't have any white suger in the house (crazy - i know) so i used two cups of soft brown sugar insteed, and it worked perfectly.  Thanks a million"
312577,117253,2008-08-20,5,"We LOVED these cheddar cheese corn fritters. I admit that I added a tad more sugar as I wanted them sweet. (We love sweet foods). Other than that we followed this spot-on recipe. This is one of the many Kittencal recipes I had on a list ""to make"". These were so easy to make, but such a wonderful addition to my meal. Great side dish!!"
2001959332,160089,2018-01-28,4,Healthier/vegan alternative: Used 1 cup of water and 1 tbsp of cornstarch In place of the egg dredge. Also I omitted the oil and just placed parchment paper dow.
1242063,67256,2009-05-05,0,"This is really good.  I made it with my son, (he loves to cook), and he could barely wait to eat it.  I love cream cheese frosting.  My husband and four kids are already asking me when I'm going to make it again.  It doesn't stay around for long."
1920020,63746,2011-05-29,3,"Recipe was good, but nowhere near as good as Krispy Kreme's.  It was fun to make them but a lot of work. Probably wouldn't make them again but its worth trying once."
1677154,114392,2012-07-29,5,excellent my new goto pizza sauce
2000178451,17509,2015-06-20,4,"For the crust
1 &amp; 1/2 stick butter
2 Tbs sugar
1 cup chopped pecans
Mix together pat into 9x13 pan bake 350 degrees for 20 mins. 
Best crust ever."
625629,155959,2008-11-06,5,Very very good.  The whole family loved this and I gave out the recipe!  Thanks so much!
37862,414317,2013-07-31,3,"This is an acceptable dish.  As I began cooking according to the directions, I realized there was no provision for when to add the olives, zest and lemon juice.  Also, the reference to pepperoncini threw me off, but I am sure that meant the red pepper."
197023,135386,2006-03-07,5,"A deliciously refreshing summer salad. Just loved the lemony flavour. I didn't peel my cucumber as the Lebanese cucumbers I always buy don't need peeling (or seeding). I doubled the number of kalamata olives and left them whole, and I added feta just before serving. A fabulous side dish to grilled or BBQd meats or a flavoursome stand alone salad (which is how I enjoyed mine) with crusty bread. Thank you, Bunny Mom, for sharing another wonderful recipe.

2732810,285832,2013-03-11,0,"I'm sorry, this recipe, when followed as-is was awful.  I'm not sure what the problem was, but this spicy peanut sauce recipe is a dud."
764845,171628,2008-03-19,5,"This is quick, simple to prepare and would likely appeal to most anyone who eats pork. The brown sugar and apples lend great flavor to the pork while keeping it moist. A definate keeper for when you're looking for something easy to prepare with ingreadients you have on hand."
422893,139807,2007-10-09,4,"I regularly do mashed potato & pumpkin together but haven't done it this way before. I love the bacon, onion addition, it really jazzes up what would otherwise be a quite plain vegie side. Great idea, one I will make again."
226867,215789,2009-03-26,5,"I made this for an after-service coffee at church tonight. Everyone raved and one person said they liked it so much that they would like to ""wallow"" in it!! Wow! It was easy to make; I served it with crackers. (PAC  Spring 09) 
ps I garnished with green onion slices and black sesame seeds."
417881,100480,2009-11-13,5,"OMG I can't keep my fork out of this pie. I cannot believe something so easy can be so delish. Hubby said "" This is the best apple pie i ever had"" so long Mrs. Smith."
403428,5170,2008-06-08,5,"Very yummy! I used a 1/3 cup measure when pouring them out and got 12 large pancakes. These had a nice, buttery taste."
918697,53605,2010-04-26,5,"Excellent.  Made a half-recipe.  No spaetzle machine or colander with large enough holes, so I did it the old-fashioned way: scraped noodles off a flat plate into the boiling water with a butterknife.  Some were a little thick, but tasty none-the-less.  Served with sauerbraten.  Teenage son ate the left-overs for a late-night snack."
2374266,287680,2012-08-23,5,Really nice we have this all the time as kids love it great for family's !
237123,135777,2005-09-23,5,Yummy! This is the first time I have tried to make any type of vodka infusion.  It is great.  I like the sweetness of it.  I skipped the rehydration of the apricots because the ones I used were really soft and moist already.  I have been drinking it in both club soda and ginger ail.  Thanks! 
296081,49401,2006-04-22,5,Super Duper Yummy!  These had a very good flavor.  I substituted lemon juice for the Sherry since I don't drink alcohol.  Very good! Did I mention Good? ;)  Even my DH said this was a keeper!
2000403125,78194,2017-11-03,5,"I've been making these quesadillas for years. I usually cook my chicken in butter (for that added flavor) and use a &quot;Mexican&quot; cheese blend. For the sauce, I used to follow it exactly, but now I just throw everything together. It always turns out fantastic! Note: if you run out of cumin or paprika, I've found that chili powder or seasoning creates a sauce similar to this one. It's not the same, but it's very delicious! Just make sure to add it to taste."
336058,272332,2010-05-23,4,"Was looking for a GF snack with lots of fiber and protein.  I used rice milk, 4 eggs, 1/2 C flax seed (instead of sesame), 1/4 C hemp protein powder (with fiber) and the rest the same.  Had to bake it 40 minutes, but it came out nice and firm.  Actually tasted better, cold, the next day."
1934136,82697,2011-06-17,5,"Thank you!! I absolutely LOVE these meatballs and they are so easy to make! I'm making them for my Dad for Father's Day. I make these all the time for my family, and now it's kind of like our tradition for me to make these every once in a while. I am 12 years old and if I can do it than I'm pretty sure any adult can! Again, thank you so much for this recipe!!"
376098,93295,2007-07-12,4,"This was good.  It wasn't anything radically different, but that was fine with me; I was just looking to use this as a simple side dish, and it did the trick.  Thank you for posting."
125388,90454,2008-12-29,5,"Very good dressing.  I halved the recipe, using one clove of garlic.  I used Splenda instead of sugar, so I had no problems with the sugar dissolving.  I served this over a salad of crisp iceberg lettuse and shredded carrots."
229619,145573,2005-11-25,5,Put these in the oven first thing Thanksgiving morning while I was getting the turkey ready to bake.  Wanted something to feed the family when all the smells brought them snooping around the kitchen.  They were wonderful!  DH really liked them.  Had a couple of squares left and had them for breakfast today. I heated mine in the microwave for about 10 seconds.  Yummy!
748089,37413,2011-06-10,1,"Sorry, we thought it was bland and not very good."
237123,304163,2008-11-24,5,"Delish.  I made a half log because I didn't have enough vital wheat gluten.  A nice change from the first seitan log.  I was a little heavy handed on the spices and next time will follow the recipe closer.  Even though the log was smaller, I still cooked it for the same amount of time and it worked great.  Thanks for posting!"
58439,374354,2009-11-21,5,"Made something VERY similar to this recently, TRUE!
Grated the garlic, tucked it under the skin too!
Instead of paprika, used Portugese spice!
With roasted veggies (potaotes, carrots, onions, WAS very nice!
Secret is to capture juices, reheating the pan for the extra hit,
Use sav blanc, sifted flour, pepper, was DEFINATELY a hit!
Would recommend this recipe as SO easy to do,
I ended up eating a half a chook by myself too!
THANKS!"
868654,152013,2008-08-18,5,"I made this to go along with Recipe #52284 and french fries and it really hit the spot!  Thick and delicious and really brought back memories of my childhood, sitting at the soda fountain at the drug store sipping on my favorite drink!  Will make again soon it was so good!"
59064,56695,2003-04-09,5,"Yum! I ran out of cilantro earlier in the week so had to substitute some parsley but it still worked out well.
Next time I may thicken up the juices with a bit of arrowroot as it is a shame to lose all that perfectly good fruit juice.
My toddler also really enjoyed this and was not scared off by the habaneros at all."
2908565,62907,2013-07-19,5,"I love this. I Changed the recipe by Adding little cubes of chicken into the pasta salad, before you add the dressing! It came out Fabulous, can&#039;t wait to keep making this!!"
169430,245503,2007-09-09,5,"I used 1/2 the fat garlic mayo in the smallest amount possible. This is a marvelous sandwich and so perfect for the cooler weather coming on. I used the deli turkey I could get, roasted turkey breast. It's a keeper."
305531,467873,2014-11-08,5,Fantastic!! I can&#039;t believe that I&#039;m the first one to review this. Lots of fish and chips lovers have missed out on a great recipe! The fries were good but the star of the show was the batter. I&#039;ve made several fish and chip recipes before but this is my new favorite. The batter was great and stuck on the fish (cod) well. I&#039;ll be making this again soon. Thanks for sharing this winner. Made for What&#039;s on the Menu tag.
9869,124503,2006-06-22,5,"This was a perfect pick me up on a cold sleety afternoon (couldnt wait past 4 o'clock!) Loved the flavours and as it used the last of my honey it's on the shopping list for today, well after all I still have red wine, brandy and orange juice left, have to make something with it!
My only other comment would be this did not serve 2..it served one..ME!  Delicious Kooka, thanks for sharing."
20371,79563,2005-03-05,5,"Boy, did I ever get rave reviews when I made this soup! I made this up and gave some to a friend, plus some to my MIL, and all called to tell me how good it was. The changes I made were minor: used 2 bay leaves instead of 1, used 1/4 tsp of thyme instead of a pinch plus added 1/4 tsp dried savory. Other than that, I followed this as written. It was so easy to make and the taste was just so, so delicious. I froze some too, which worked well. Thanks so much for sharing!"
169130,87380,2006-08-06,5,"Love this!  I bought the jelly at a shop at Kitchen Kettle Village in Lancaster, PA while visiting recently and they give out samples of this.  Boy, does it sell a ton of jelly.  I like mine on Triscuit crackers."
107135,90745,2005-03-09,5,add some cinnamon to this 1/2 teaspoon
600208,166289,2009-01-21,5,"This is one of my favorite new recipe's! It is so easy, mostly healthy, and delicious I can make it a regular. Thanks for posting it. Keep up the good cooking!"
39835,85002,2005-02-04,4,This soup has good flavor but it wasn't as spicy as we like - next time I will increase the Asian chili sauce a bit to at least 1/2 teaspoon. Thanks for sharing!
2001775882,467362,2017-11-02,5,How many crepes does this make?
2002250296,373374,2018-08-17,5,"I tried this just as an experiment, because I had extra beets and was out of ideas. My wife absolutely loves this recipe, and has insisted I make it again. Simple but super tasty!"
133174,455551,2011-05-30,5,This is a different and delightful way to serve green beans.  Olive oil was used for the oil.  The beans were steamed till crisp tender.  The salad was served at room temperature.  Made for the Vivacious Violets during ZWT 7.
2000729009,524863,2015-12-06,5,Look delicious!
63807,88615,2004-04-12,5,"Made this for Easter - went over really well! I was able to find really fresh beans at the store, and everything went together very nicely. Even the kids liked these!"
184819,88486,2007-10-30,5,"I used this recioe with boneless pork loin chops, so I adjusted the ingredients. Was sooooo good. Think it was the best pork chops i've ever had thank you for the recipe"
23293,16752,2002-03-12,5,The Best Scalloped Potatoes I've ever had!
2001796296,71849,2018-10-28,5,Amazing recipe! Thank you so much. They were a bit crumbly but we love them that way!
6357,86637,2004-03-16,5,"What a beautiful combination of ingredients! I just loved the few things you put together(all easily available at anyone's house)and the taste to boot! This was really really nice and very simple to make as well.  The only additional ingredient I used was 1/2 tsp. of freshly powdered cinnamon in the syrup mixture. It was very nice to eat this dessert for BREAKFAST this morning!(You know, I felt that if I wanted the ay ahead to be good, I had to start it on a sweet note;))
Thank you for posting this !"
98812,360000,2009-03-31,5,"There are actual chunks of potato in this muffins which made them quite unusual to me.  I served them to guests and everyone gave them a thumbs up.   They provided a good topic for conversation, too!"
516457,93886,2007-08-20,5,"Very easy to make, peeling is tedious, but the most difficult part.  I used this last year and will this recipe again this year, thanks for sharing!!"
113868,84310,2004-04-05,4,"This recipe was quick and easy to make.  This recipe recommended to let it set for about 1 hour, but I like vinegar, and I thought that the salad tasted better on the second day after the salad could marinate in the dressing for a little extra time."
67656,116988,2007-07-14,5,"My mom never cared for casseroles so they are not part of my childhood memories.  Despite that, when I crave comfort food, I often find myself looking for one.  Tagged this  knowing that I could make it fit my low fat diet and still have a great meal, and indeed it exceeded my expectations.  I made three changes which are quite standard for my kitchen 1) replacing the ground beef with Morningstar Farms beef crumbles, 2) using whole wheat noodles and 3) using a reduced fat cheddar/mozzarella combination on top.  Given the wonderful flavors of the sauce and other components dinner was superb.  The sauce has a great contrast of sweet (the peppers, corn and soup) balanced out by the savory flavors from the garlic, jalapenos, mustard and chili powder. It was just delicious and yielded big, stick-to-your-ribs portions. My one other comment was that my casserole was bubbling hot in about 30 minutes so definitely watch for doneness.  Thanks!"
79989,63786,2008-02-24,0,"Made it tonight, tastes excellent.  I made a few changes, like I made the salsa myself with tomatoes, asian chilli sauce, lime, coriander and red onion, and I also made some beetroot puree/sauce to add to it. 
Most delicious!"
5060,10721,2002-03-12,5,"Bergy, I kinda followed Tebo's lead, thank-you both!!  I put some mandarin orange slices in the bottom of wine glasses with some chocolate curles, put the cream in and topped it with more chocolate curles and a couple of mandarin orange slices.  It was a huge hit!! and the presentation caused oohhhs  and aahhhs !!  It was a wonderfull dinner party dessert."
537188,354004,2009-03-13,5,I'm rating this even though I only made the chickpea part but it tasted so good I felt it deserved it! I put the chickpeas into the food processor with most of the 11 ingredients apart from the basil and parmesan as I didn't have any. Instead I used some red pesto. I served this in pita pockets with some feta cheese and lettuce and it made a brilliant lunch. Thanks!
304235,61153,2007-03-19,5,Great recipe!  The flavor is great and very easy to make.  I will be making it a lot this summer. It is great dish to bring to BBQs.  Thanks for sharing!
357071,454315,2011-09-15,5,This was excellent and what a great way to use all that summer squash. thanks
125411,81207,2004-12-22,5,"During this hectic holiday season, I was looking for quick, fresh dinner ideas. This was absolutely tasty! I did add more garlic and a dash of crushed red pepper(just a personal preference) with delicious results. Thanks for posting, Uncle Bill!"
542159,227991,2009-07-07,5,Yummy! Made as written and would not change a thing. Thanks so much for the great post.
309630,333702,2010-03-29,5,Made your recipe for Alfredo and then completed this recipe with that sauce.  Really good. Made for PAC Spring10
125325,159239,2007-02-11,5,"I love arugula but never thought of sauteeing them. I've made this almost every week, it's my new favorite way to eat veggies. Thanks so much Rita :)"
232463,361715,2009-10-18,5,"These are delish!  The lemon juice tip worked a dream.  Unfortunately, there was user error and I grabbed too big of a grating disc for the food processor and my potato and apples were too coarsely grated - (didn't have any more eggs to add to hold them together.)  but I made some great hash browns with them.  The apple adds a subtle sweetness.  I'll be making these again!"
885339,78024,2009-01-17,5,"This is a hearty recipe! My family really liked it. I did some changes to the basic recipe to make it more like a Spanish paella. I omitted the dill and added a few pinches of saffron as well as one pinch of cayenne. I also added some frozen peas at the same time as the shrimps. I also needed to add more liquid to cook well the rice. Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used canned tomatoes which I strained to measure up the liquid properly. VoilÃÂ !"
440735,147850,2010-05-02,4,I used fresh minced garlic and cut back on the rosemary by about a 1/2 tsp. I am always afraid rosemary may overpower the dish.  My chicken was a little dry. I think basting is a must.  Made for Everyday is a Holiday 2010.
497077,209076,2008-10-29,5,"This bread is DELICIOUS! I followed recipe exactly w/ perfect results. Thank you, French Tart, for a great recipe! Made for the Think Pink Tag Game In Honor of Breast Cancer Awareness, October 2008."
28636,97523,2007-06-10,5,"Yummy doughnuts!!  I used butter in the recipe and only needed 3 tablespoons of the butter for dipping.  Lovely texture, great taste...they didn't last long at my house!  We made 12 muffins with this batter.  They're dreamy Dreamgoddess."
453856,80728,2009-01-20,4,"We really liked this!! I would have given 5 stars, but I found that as written there wasn't enough liquid. I added about 20oz of water (we were out of milk),some garlic and some carrots but otherwise made it as written. It cam out delicious- the flavor reminded me of a good pot roast, but it's much more affordable! We'll definitely be making this again, Thanks!!"
37449,163043,2007-10-15,4,A lovely salad that I enjoye along with cherry tomatoes. I baked the nuts for 15 minutes and some of it burned but otherwise this was really good. So be sure to keep an eye on the walnuts. Next time I will bake for 8-10 minutes and check them. Thank you! Made for Pick a Chef!
2001598395,390234,2017-06-24,4,I have been cooking this for thirty years after seeing it on his show in the 80's. It was always a favorite he used red wine and I always use a good one and he also took filet mignon and cut it into 1/4 inch slices and seared it very quickly...this was the frugal part to make it more affordable. I always make extra sauce and serve with fresh french bread to sop up the sauce. Thanks for posting.
39857,18632,2004-12-10,5,I made this for dinner tonight for my wife. It was very tasty! It would go well with pasta. It was really good!
353381,104248,2008-02-10,5,"Eggcellent!  Oh, I couldn't resist a little cheesiness!  I've made this a few times and this has now made it into my fast-food breakfast days...days when I haven't prepared hot cereal, but still want something healthy.  Super quick, tasty, and I mic it for 45 secs on High and it comes out perfect!  Thanks Trisha!"
2002063018,447553,2018-03-19,5,"I made these exactly as the recipe stated. They turned out DELICIOUS &amp; beautiful! I wasn't sure about how the cream cheese filling would be because it was a bit runny, but they turned out great. They were a bit tedious, with three different components to make, but it was well worth it. Will definitely be making them again!"
2002019965,100663,2018-03-19,0,Made according to directions. Turned out perfect! My friends are raving!
330545,362501,2011-09-27,5,I made these as an after-school snack for my GD and her frieds.  They scoffed them up and all gave a thumbs up.  Coming from this finicky group that means five stars.
197023,307320,2008-09-28,4,"A really tasty soup which two friends and I enjoyed today for lunch.  Being so quick to prepare, this is a great recipe to have in one's repertoire.  Since it has so few ingredients, I believe that it is essential to use a really tasty broth; it also makes this a versatile recipe to which you can so readily add vegetables which you have on hand and which would perhaps be better used today rather than tomorrow. I used my Vegetable Stock #135453, and added a leek (that otherwise was in danger of not being used) in step one and a couple of handfuls of chopped baby spinach leaves in step five.  And I followed ellie_'s lead in using a mixture of wild rice and regular rice, as I always enjoy this blend.  Thank you, Engrossed, for sharing another flavoursome recipe.  Made for All New Zaar Cookbooks Tag."
88717,15968,2006-12-13,5,Thank you for posting this recipe. It's one of my favorites and I lost my recipe. I made a double batch and they turned out yummy. I'm surprised this recipe hasn't been reviewed yet. They are very good!
37449,89181,2005-03-02,5,"I scaled this down to 2 servings, used 1/3 cup mayo  using the 3 tsp. vinegar and sugar, 2 tsp. milk. I liked it like that! Thanks!"
302795,19577,2011-06-15,5,"These are delicious! I doubled everything but the pork and ended up with about 120 rolls.  I did not use the egg to seal but just my moistened fingertip and found that worked just fine.  I also followed the advice of a previous poster and brushed my pan as well as the rolls with oil.  I used peanut oil and thought the result was excellent!  Nice and crispy.  I found that wrapping them by folding the two corners on the sides and then rolling them worked best for me.  I may try to add more veggies like bean sprouts (I am not sure if you can freeze bean sprouts?)and eliminate the pork or try ground chicken instead, I think both ways would be good.  I also found there to be too much garlic as others have posted, I think I would cut it to half the amount.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce, and thought it could use a bit more."
157126,58347,2006-03-19,5,I had to take time to rate this after making it so many times.  This is great!  Fast and easy to put together.  This is a real hit with my picky 2 year old!  Thanks for posting. 
446403,16981,2008-04-16,5,"Great!  I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes with Italian herbs.  I didn't have lemon juice, so I substituted lime juice (bottled).  I skipped the green onion, but threw in a few dashes of onion powder.  I used 2 tbs minced garlic.  I traded in the parmesan cheese for pecorino romano.  I also added 6 oz fresh, steamed baby spinach.  I didn't - but I suggest you do - snip of the stems :-)  For pasta, I used whole wheat blend linguine (Ronzoni - low fat, sodium free, cholesterol free food).  Oh, and for italian seasoning, I used oregano and basil.  Hubby, baby and I loved it!"
118342,46780,2008-12-30,5,"YUMM!  What a pleasant change from pumpkin pie!  This was a huge hit at Christmas dinner.  I beat the eggs with a fork before adding to the mixture, as this helps with the consistency.  I also doubled the cinnamon.  This recipe deserves all 5 stars!"
174096,473356,2013-08-16,5,These are great - very flavorful!  I subbed in corn tortillas to make it gluten free.  Very quick prep too.  Thanks for sharing!  Veggie Swap 61
518488,213214,2007-11-15,5,"Yum! I was making pumpkin puree today, wondering how in the world I would use it all (I made about 15 pounds!), when I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I was already making a batch of cornbread for my father, so I whipped this one up along with it.  It's a very hearty bread b/c of the whole wheat (and I used stone-ground cornmeal as well), but moist and sweet. I'm thinking about making this to serve with Thanksgiving dinner.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was I substituted buttermilk for the milk since that's all I had, but it turned out great, nonetheless!"
174991,13473,2005-11-26,5,I made this as part of our Thanksgivings dinner and it is wonderful.  I did as MonicaD suggested and added 1 c applesauce.  My husband loves turnip and he loved this.  This will be my new turnip recipe.  Thanks for sharing.
128693,112064,2006-04-14,5,"On a whim, I bought some molasses and then had to find a recipe to use it in. This one looked great, and it was! I omitted the walnuts and the egg wash (personal preference). It turned out so nice, not crumbly at all like some other recipes I've used. The first loaf I made disappeared in a matter of minutes (fresh, warm bread is a real treat in this house; we're just a bunch of carbaholics!), and I had to make 2 more loaves. I mixed them and kneaded them right in my kitchaid, placed the dough into the bread pan, let it rise, and baked. Couldn't be simpler. Molasses will have to become a staple in my house now! Thanks for posting. "
141569,70294,2005-07-05,5,"The cookies taste perfect. I baked them for about 15 min. (I made very large cookies!). It made them crunchy outside and chewy inside, the way I like them. Thanks a lot!"
311904,17012,2007-11-19,5,"These is great.  We've had this dish twice in the past two weeks.  The second time, we added cubed ham steak (don't add any extra salt with this version).  It's delicious and reheats nicely in the microwave."
689332,149506,2009-03-08,5,Yummy and super easy. Thanks!
204124,169303,2008-09-21,5,"This recipe was right on time.  I just had to try it.  On my last visit to the liquor store, they had home canned Spicy Pickled Okra on the counter by the checkout. I asked my buddy that works there all about it, and he said that several customers had requested it.  It is home canned from homegrown Okra, by a lady that lives here in the Florida Panhandle area bout 15 miles south of the AL line. I bought a jar for the next time we have Bloody Mary's, but when I saw this recipe, just had to try it.  What a great Martini, the spicy okra gave it some zip, but wasn't overpowering.  I will be making these on a regular basis.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!!"
64583,104242,2004-11-22,5,Very good!  The coating was nice and crispy and very flavorful (I used ranch flavored croutons).  
208196,12291,2009-11-26,5,Simple and delicious.  Great instructions.
1494593,113817,2010-01-14,5,This is a teriffic recipe !! ...so tasty and yet so simple...this is a keeper ..I made as directed but put slices of lemon on top then covered with foil  ... I will definately make this again...Thanks Paula
66983,57634,2003-04-15,5,"This was really yummy!!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I live at high altitude and wild rice takes longer to cook.  I also left out the wine and added more chicken stock.  Thanks for the new yummy side dish"
324390,109685,2007-11-24,5,Quick and easy. I added some cumin and onion powder and reduced the water to 2 cups as I like my sauce on the thicker side. I love that it can easily be made with ingredients from the pantry.
260911,58708,2009-09-16,5,"Excellent sauce!  I had so many tomatoes from my garden that ripened all at once.  This recipe helped me use them.  I didn't bother peeling the tomatoes; I just cut the tops off, squeezed some juice out and chopped them into large pieces before adding to the pan of sauteed onions and garlic.  I didn't have summer savory so I left it out, but increased the sugar to about 1/4 cup.  After cooking uncovered for over an hour, I pureed in a blender.  Then, I cooked it down for about another 2 hours to thicken it up.  Instead of canning, I froze it in small containers.  Each container will make about 2 pizzas.  My family loved the sauce on homemade pizza."
256411,190433,2008-07-30,4,"Nice recipe...I orginally found it in a cookbook from the National Honey Board but was pleased to see someone had posted it here also! I like this bread because I don't like my cranberry (or oat bread) to be sweet, so using honey is a nice alternative! I also use egg substitute in place of the whole eggs and I split the flour into half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour. THANKS for sharing!"
476359,81845,2007-11-22,5,"The previous reviewers are right, this is SOO Flavorful! I love the smell it makes when cooking. I didn't have the mexican tomatoes, so I diced three plum tomoatoes and added red chile powder, a pinch or two of oregano and tons of garlic powder. I also made it vegan by using Vegan Gourmet mozzarella and chedder cheeses. For left overs I made  a burrito topped with salsa...SO AWESOME! Thanks so much for the recipe!!!"
121683,350239,2010-04-25,5,Thank you for this receipe.  It is simple to make and the presentation is impressive.  I serve this as an appetizer and leave it whole and cut it into servings at the table.  Dinner guests always ask for the recipe.  I've found that you can use any combination of cold cuts and it still comes out delicious.  Kol HaKavod!!!
1110599,111128,2009-01-03,4,"I found this recipe a wonderful , I added a half a bottle of dark beer and found it complimented the recipe perfect."
199848,87935,2007-03-30,5,"I loved the subtle creaminess that the cottage cheese gives this recipe.  I used butter instead of maragarine, but otherwise no changes were made.  I'll certainly make this version again.  Thanx for sharing."
343262,163238,2008-01-17,5,"Great recipe ! One can also use part evaporated milk , it's creamy and isn't as expensive as cream. This is great made with ground beef that has been browned and drained. Add lots of black pepper and serve on toast or mashed potatoes. Either meat you use will make a warm filling meal. I've seen recipes that call for 1 cup shredded cheese to be melted into the white sauce."
349800,132470,2006-10-02,5,"I really liked this recipe.  These are just like my grandma used to make!  I served ""Easy and Tasty BBQ Crockpot Chicken"" <a href=""/95569"">Easy and Tasty Barbecue Chicken Sandwiches in the Crockpot</a> over these.  Definately a keeper for me."
187927,216715,2009-02-05,5,"Simply marvelous! I can see why this has been your family's go-to birthday cake for over five decades, Engrossed! :) I made this for my fiance's birthday, with only two minor changes: 1) I added 1/4 tsp. almond extract to the truffle filling to give it a subtle yet noticeable depth of flavor, and 2) instead of all vanilla extract for the frosting, I used 3/4 tsp. vanilla and 1/4 tsp. almond... we just find that a hint of almond does wonderful things to chocolate, but I already have in mind so many other flavors that would be phenomenal in this cake (raspberry? mmmmm...) and will experiment the next time I make it. Everyone *loved* this surprisingly easy cake, even our one guest who normally does not care for whipped cream frosting. The truffle filling was perfect, and really puts this cake over the top. Thank you for a cake that will surely become a tradition in our family, too! EDITED TO ADD: I used regular baking cocoa for the cake, but Hershey's Special Dark cocoa for the filling. The contrast of color and flavor was just right!"
88099,21131,2008-10-17,5,"I am a blue cheese lover and this was just a wonderful combination of flavors, predominantly blue cheese.  If you don't care for it, you will hate this.  DH doesn't care for it, but I knew that before I made it so he doesn't count.  Everything went so well together.  Served on social crackers as a snack.  Thanks Kathy for all the wonderful work you do here."
552613,312165,2009-03-25,4,"Easy, tasty and healthy - always a good trio in a recipe.  I also went with adding a bit of soy and had them with noodles.  Made for 1-2-3 tag."
1019947,128020,2008-11-10,4,"so nice to see a real fish cake recipe! very gourmet and delicious!
thanks!"
2310,55995,2003-03-22,5,"What an unusual and delicious dressing.  I didn't know what I would put on the salad to compliment the dressing, so I made a simple spinach salad.  It was perfect. I didn't change or substitute any of the ingredients, and was totally satisfied.  This will have a permanent place in my salad repetoire.
Thanks, Sharon123"
286566,228159,2009-09-08,5,"Good thing I doubled this recipe though I must have made mine with a bit too much filling as I got 40, baked at 200C fan forced oven for 15 minutes.  Sent them the next day to the DS's music recreation group were they were much appreciated, they heated some up as it was a cold wet day so these were perfect but some did not make it to the oven as they were wanted now but declared equally good hot or cold.  Thank you Joy, made for Edition 8 - Make My Recipe."
61660,186193,2008-06-12,5,"I took the hit from NCMysteryShopper and mix the dressing ingredients in a small container.  Shook like mad and it was perfect!  I am not a huge mustard fan, but this was a great dressing and DH and BIL really enjoyed it.  Made for the Babes of ZWT4."
591016,32446,2009-09-10,5,Just like my Grandmas! light and fluffy. Also not over sweet. Thanks for the recipe!
88099,205326,2007-11-25,4,This was very nice and so easy to put together.  I added extra lime juice but other than that made as directed.  I think some cilantro would work well with this salad.  Thanks
787270,13285,2008-03-11,4,"4 out of 5 because I didn't follow the recipe to the T.

I didn't have any italian seasoning on hand and didn't use the olives. I did substitute fresh parsley and onion for the dried/powdered variety.  Also, I squeezed a little lemon juice, added some of the zest and 1 garlice clove (that I grated on a microplane - I love that microplane!).  I pan fried it in olive oil.  Served it with some tzatziki in a pita with more feta, fresh parsley, lettuce and tomatoes.  Delish!"
1912789,33645,2011-05-19,4,"I added two tablespoons of yogurt and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter and substituted buttermilk for milk, gluten-free baking mix for flour. And since we're in Maine, I added a cup of frozen Maine blueberries. My sweetie says that it's an 8 or a 9 out of 10! I'll make it again."
2137537,19859,2012-01-06,5,"I've been making this for about 2 years. I came across a similar recipe on another site. This recipe is definitely a favorite of mine and my boyfriend loves it too! For an extra kick, I get rid of the water and cook the chicken in about 1/2 cup of of white wine. It tastes like I worked for hours on end to make this dish, but it's very easy to throw together. It smells great while it's cooking too. I serve it over angel hair pasta."
111899,179083,2006-08-07,5,"Very yummy!  Dinner guests loved it.  Next time, I will use less butter (maybe 1/4 cup) and sprinkle with paprika just for a little color.  Thanks for sharing."
166642,313722,2008-09-09,5,"Is this ever a great way to make a baked potato! This is so good and so much better than the ordinary kind. I made exactly as stated and they were loved by my family. I served these with ""Recipe#268707"". Thanks for sharing!"
427576,112304,2008-09-24,5,"This recipe is excellent, especially if you don't know how to cook paneer. Simple, easy and fast. My friends love it, and people are always requesting the recipe from me.
A real Indian origional, i couldn't find this in any local restaurant, and have only been able to have it on holiday in India... yum !"
416738,25417,2006-12-26,5,"Delectable.  I didn't have milk powder, so I used regular milk.  This of course made it more watery, so I had to boil it for longer to get it to the desired consistency.  Also added flour to that purpose.  And for the herbs, I used thyme instead of marjoram.  Seriously excellent.  Give it a try."
92006,192150,2009-05-29,5,"Yummy. This salad is really not for simple palates. I loved the contrast of textures. I halved the recipe and used about 1/8 cup celery because I don't care much for it, almonds (chopped and toasted), and cream similar to creme fraiche instead of the mayonnaise, which I don't like. I added a small, chopped cucumber because it needed to be used up. Also reduced the amount of salt and added black pepper. I came out great! Than so much for posting! Made for the All Aboard challenge - ZWT5  & the Dining Daredevils."
2000221157,483803,2016-08-19,3,"try with infused french lavender leaves, awesome!!"
563781,33921,2007-08-30,5,"Great tasting!!!  It turned out a little runny and I had to bake it for an extra 20 minutes.. but that may be because I doubled the sauce.  Regardless, it turned out fantastic, and I will be making this often!  Thank you!!"
29956,5453,2002-12-10,5,Delicious. I also cut down the milk and sprinkled chopped macadamias and coconut on top. They were a huge success at work. 
173579,38912,2011-06-09,5,This is the best homemade dip I have ever had.  My DH said it tasted like it was toasted.  It was also quick and easy to fix.  Thanks for posting.
201581,240945,2007-10-15,4,"When I read the ingredients I thought this would turn out like meringues. NOT! They are lovely, chewy cookies, perfect for chocoholics. I wanted to make them as posted for a fair review, but I will try them again experimenting with Splenda for part of the sugar. I'll update my review if it works. Made for PAC Fall '07."
509918,90544,2008-01-31,5,"This was excellent.  The best vegan mayonnaise I've ever made.  It's just like Vegenaise, which is very expensive.  I did find a tablespoon of salt to be way too much.  I will definitely cut it in half next time.  Thanks so much for sharing."
47892,414294,2011-02-23,0,"The recipe was reduced to 2 servings and baked in an 8"" cast iron skillet. I used<br/>a medley of organic frozen Oregon-grown berries and added a dollop of sour cream to <br/>each serving and light sprinkle of freshly grated nutmeg. I think almond extract would make a good substitute for the vanilla extract. I especially thought the orange zest was a delicious addition. Easy to make! Reviewed for Best of 2010."
1479319,44194,2010-01-02,5,This is amazing. I also add a little of the pineapple juice from the can to the liquid mixture. A huge hit with the whole family and many friends: I have made this dish multiple times over the last 4 years or so and I just joined the site so I thought I should leave a review!
163112,324619,2008-10-27,5,"A definite favorite with this family!  I would increase the ginger as imho, it's a bit too subtle (for our tastes).  This didn't last long & will be made repeatedly.  Thank you, Mike!!  Made for the Vegan Swap 10/08."
162759,30488,2005-02-01,5,"This is terrific!  Even my husband, the carnivore, loved the salad I made with this dressing.  I used half the salt, but I added a pinch of garlic salt.  It came out perfect!"
498271,483086,2012-07-21,5,"Sometimes the simplest things are the best and this is one of those times!  The citrus vinaigrette created by the marinating of the oranges was so fresh and tasty.  I don't care for raw onion so left it off mine but DH enjoyed it on his.  Finished with plenty of black pepper and really enjoyed - thanks for sharing the recipe!  Made for ZWT8, Chefs gone WILD!"
340980,217674,2008-04-10,2,"I agree with JESMorn.  Too much of an evaporated milk taste for me.  I can see why others love it, it's not horrible but it didn't do it for me.  Sorry :("
2000951508,87075,2016-03-31,4,"Could be 4 stars, could be 5, all I know was this was a BIG HIT!  I think I added garlic since anytime I use onion, I figure garlic goes with it.  I am going to make this tonight and I think I&#039;ll use beef broth instead of water just to add to the beefy richness, but the water was certainly good.

I took a tip from Chef John at foodwishes.com and his Sloppy Joe recipe, and I started with the meat and onions in a cold pan.  As he put it, we want &#039;maximum crumbliness&#039; and presumably the cold ban and all the breaking up of the meat and the simmering of the water will give you that."
736607,518914,2016-02-08,4,"This was a great way to use leftover pulled pork.  I didn&#039;t have the cheese soup, but the sauce was cheesy and smooth.   I left the jalapenos on the side, given the kids don&#039;t like spicy foods.  A hit at the Super Bowl! Thanks for sharing!"
158815,320348,2010-09-05,0,YUmmmmmmm!!!!!!!  So easy too!
226863,253406,2012-07-30,5,"So loved this recipe!  My DS has become a blue cheese lover, and he's home for college break and I'm cooking for him, as well as ZWT8!  This recipe saved the day.  I did use a filet, so mine was exceptionally tender, especially after marinating for so long.  Thanks for sharing!"
465829,298971,2008-12-09,5,"Wow! I did not think you could do brown rice in the steamer, but now I have this great tip to do it. It was nice to be able to have something a little more healthy to serve to my kids without them really knowing it. I have a couple small bags waiting for me in the freezer to throw into soups as needed! Made and Reviewed for EveryDay Holiday Tag - Thanks! :)"
6258,111275,2009-02-19,4,"I love bologna sandwiches.  You make them and I'll eat them. LOL
I really liked the simplicity of this spread, and it was a breeze to make.  I really don't like the sweet pickles, so I used dill.  I will definately use this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing."
146149,60287,2004-08-28,5,"Changed a little - added juice and rind of 1 lemon, and 1/2 teaspoon of Lemon Flav.; as well, used Lemon Cake mix. Now THAT's lemony!!

Topped with Lemon Whipped Cream #54274 and won Blue Ribbon for Best EVER Cake!!!

Added some strawberries to top just for that little extra!
"
644902,305739,2008-06-03,5,love the combination of the bacon and garlic - great dish for that left over rice!!!
162996,94242,2004-09-14,4,Delicious flavors and a great way to use fresh tomatos from the garden.
6258,58701,2003-06-04,5,"These cakes are definately Southern, and definately good.  I did everything the way you directed, except I added about 2 tsps. fresh lemon juice.  I think the lemon gave the salmon a zestier, fresher taste.  I will definately be using this delicious recipe again."
1802604365,347623,2014-04-22,5,"I followed the directions exactly and thought this was very tasty.  Not quite as good as I remember my grandmother&#039;s, but that would not be possible. Better than Cracker Barrel though.  Thanks for posting it."
174722,245490,2009-01-19,5,"I just had to drop everything and rate this recipe!! This is fabulous! I had it last night with a big bowl of Minestrone and then heated the leftover garlic bread in the toaster oven today for lunch! I think it was even better the second day, if that's possible! This is the best recipe I've found on RZ yet! I used mozzerella cheese instead of jack. Can't imagine it being any better than it was!! I'd give this 11 stars if y
they'd let me!"
820346,115565,2008-07-13,5,"Great recipe!  I modified it just a touch, using thyme instead of oregano.  

I marinated it for about 12-14 hours, then cooked it on low in my crockpot for 6 hours.  For moisture, I added 1/4 of a hard cider beer.

When done, I shredded it with a fork and put it back in its juices and kept it on warm until I was ready to serve. 

Served with mango salsa and flax seed chips.  Delish!"
193804,36336,2008-05-14,5,This is delicious! I used the blender to combine the wet ingredients (my kids don't like chunky stuff) and decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup.  I only had to bake my loaves for 55 minutes or so.  Love the moist texture.
353485,391292,2010-05-16,5,"I made these tonight and they are delicious! I used craisins in place of raisins and left out the option flax.  I also added blueberries as suggested by Chef 573772 and they took longer to cook, but are well worth it."
39547,7756,2005-02-26,5,"I made this for Steingrim's dinner tonight - delicious!  I did have some differences, however.  I used buffalo, rather than beef.  I used fresh baby spinach leaves, 6 ounces (about 4 cups) rather than actual rau muong.  I misread the recipe and chopped up 2 medium onions - but it tasted quite good with that much!  I also used 2 large cloves of garlic.  A good subtitle for this recipe would be ""Vietnamese Pepper Beef with Spinach.""  :)  One nifty thing about the recipe is the use of cornstarch as a ""marinade"" before cooking the meat - when you use cornstarch this way, it tenderizes the meat and gives it a really nice, velvety texture!  We'll be making this again!  Advice: don't substitute soy sauce for the nuoc mam/nam pla - the fish sauce really does wonderful things to the overall flavor of the dish."
19198,52253,2007-07-12,5,"Wow, this is pure comfort food.  Didn't change a thingwith the chicken and broth part except next time I may cut some of the skin off the chicken because there was alot of fat on top.  Did use my dumpling recipe I've used for years.  Which is just flour, baking powder, salt, oil and milk.  Was worried that the broth wouldn't thicken up but it did nicely after adding the dumplings.  Thank you for sharing a great recipe."
166642,275447,2009-05-10,5,These are so good! They made such a delicious snack or lunch. My sons enjoyed them a lot. Thanks for sharing!
416260,170401,2008-03-22,5,"Loved the recipe so much that it's become a ""company"" dish for us.  We live in France, and rabbit is a popular dish here -which means there is stiff competition in terms of recipes!  But, I've had rave reviews each time I've served this!  And, yes, I agree about adding additional sauce.  It's so-o-o-o delicious."
27961,41318,2011-08-28,5,Excellent. Thanks for the new keeper.
234372,20713,2006-12-19,5,"Absolutely the BEST hot chocolate mix I've ever tried.  It makes a lot (I had to mix it in my turkey pan because I didn't have a bowl big enough), but that's cool - now I can give some as gifts and still have plenty left for me. :)"
49482,22391,2005-04-23,5,"I absolutely adore onion, so I might be a little biased, but this recipe is perfect. 
What a gently different way to serve onion. The possibilities are ENDLESS. I served on top of baked chicken, on a slice of (Chicago-style) deep-dish pizza, in a sandwich wrap, and plain (gasp!), out of the jar. - And this was all within the first day of opening the jar - which I let marinate for 2 days. (My breath may not be the best) Soooo good."
37036,125726,2009-01-02,5,Very Good!  This is probably the best Salisbury steak I've had.  I made exactly as the recipe stated.  Thanks Karen for posting!
181447,54257,2008-12-30,5,I have made this several times and get rave reviews every time I make it. My brother who doesn't like meat loaf tried it and loved it!! Thanks for posting

1418023,256064,2009-11-15,5,"LOVED this!!!!  I used my homemade spaghetti sauce with ground beef and pepperoni in it.  We are adding this into our OAMC rotation!  My hubby LOVES it!  Thanks for another wonderful recipe, Kittencal!"
997194,69484,2009-10-08,5,This was fabulous I really enjoyed the simplicity of the recipe as well as the flavours that explode in your mouth. DH really enjoyed them as well though next time I think I might add some chilli in the recipe. Fantastic! Worth a try.
66708,413569,2010-02-20,5,"My,Oh My, You're right.  This has good taste and texture."
57404,65287,2005-01-02,5,"i had to make a few modifications, but this came out very yummy!  i only had about a half a tbsp left of brown sugar, so i put that in with a few packets of splenda.  i also used low sodium soy sauce.  came out great, and very quick and cheap too.  i'm sure it would also be good with all splenda subbed for sugar, which i will try next time.

299829,20376,2007-04-24,0,"thanks so much for posting this traditional recipe. i moved to England where gasp shock ... they dont stock butterscotch chips in the grocery stores!!! managed to smuggle a generic brand of chips home with me on my last trip from the states but NO RECIPE!! so glad to find my own favorite here, clear, consice, and easy to follow... now if i can just get the hang of weighing ingredients instead of cups and teaspoons lol...

732425,287708,2011-09-29,5,"This tasted good just making it! For those allergic to dairy, here are the subs:<br/><br/>Tofutti non dairy cream cheese (plain)<br/>Rich Whip whipping cream (8 oz. carton, available in most freezer sections)<br/><br/>It turned out great and there was no taste difference that my friends could discern. Easy to make and highly recommended. <br/><br/>It should be noted, as I didn't see it in the recipe, that this has to be kept in the refrigerator."
357723,37928,2006-11-15,5,Ohhhh myyyy word this is goooooood! I normally do not like blue cheese dressing but this was fabulous. The flavors are incredible together. My children loved the flavor as well. Thank you Miss Diggy!
399474,317876,2008-08-23,4,"Very tasty delicious pancakes. The whole family loved the flavor! The pancakes came up nice and fluffy. The almonds in the pancake batter gave it a good crunch. It was a little time consuming for being pancakes, but worth the work. My only complaint would be that it only made 4 small pancakes. If I were to make again I would double or triple the batter amount. I also would probably warm the berries up in the microwave for a little bit. The pancakes were delicious though! My son said it was 10 stars! The family did agree that it was not quite enough to feed more then 2 people. Thanks so much! Made for RSC#12"
292917,142387,2011-03-06,5,"This is great, thanks for the recipe, only thing I changed was I added 4 teaspoons of vital wheat gluten.  It baked up great and looks pretty tastes good toooo !!!"
780172,298561,2008-10-09,5,"This was a very good sandwich and quite easy to prepare, only thing I different was I did not toast the bread, it probably would have been good to do this, but it was fine not doing it. Loved the onions. Also, we added a little mustard."
1667115,195947,2010-08-29,0,"I liked the combination. Quick and easy. I just cut the zucchini in smaller pieces, and used salsa instead of pasta sauce. I will surely make it again."
2001247310,54257,2016-11-15,5,"No doubt, this was wonderful! We had a meatloaf challenge at the church, I'd never made one before and tried this recipe. Guess who's meatloaf was actually hidden from people? This one!!! It was hidden so the leaders could enjoy it!! IT WAS PHENOMENAL! I'm going to add it to our recipe rotation for the family. The only variation, I only used about 3T of brown sugar. It was very juicy and devoured! You will not have leftovers so make two!"
28649,10318,2005-04-27,4,I liked not having to cook the noodles before making this but I thought it was a little dry.  I liked the idea of using sliced mozzarella also.
4439,56708,2003-03-27,3,"My family and I were not too crazy about this recipe. We did not like the texture or taste of the chicken. We thought the sauce was too mild in flavor and had a weird consistency. Sorry, but I will not make it again."
125773,99567,2004-09-14,5,This is excellent!!!! It is nice and spicey and very easy to prepare. I followed the recipe. I served with jicima/apple salad.Thanks for posting.
175824,66241,2006-02-14,5,Excellent flavor. These were soooo good and flavorful. They taste the way pancakes are supposed to taste. Delicious and light.  I will never again use the box mix again. I followed the recipe exactly. Loved the vanilla. Thank you for sharing such a great and easy recipe. 
201972,65704,2005-04-24,5,"We enjoyed this recipe very much but we added a few things like ca. 100g of ham pieces, a cup of stock and 325g of ""latina"" Tomato, Pinenut & Parmesan fresh pasta sauce."
191220,73166,2008-10-29,3,"Made this last night and it was good but not what me or my family were expecting.  It was rather on the sweet side.  I used Honey Brown (cuz that is what I had) and the flavor really came thru and it smelled really good while it was cooking, but the taste was not there for us.  I guess we are just use to ""TEXAS Style Chili""."
395713,211485,2010-01-22,4,"I really liked this recipe, and I think with a bit of tweaking it could be perfect.  I used fresh ginger, which was great (you've GOT to like ginger to enjoy this recipe).  Make sure you really chop that garlic and ginger very fine. I used about 1/2 t chili powder (not cayenne) which was the perfect touch of heat.  The sauce turned out a bit too sweet for my taste, so I think next time I'll half the honey and add 1 T soy sauce. Not only is this really easy to make, but it's SUPER low fat!  SCORE!"
41578,78997,2008-01-01,5,"Oh my. . . what an easy and great tasting pie.  I used pineapple and we loved it.  (I have a great baked pineapple recipe, but this is so much easier to prepare when I need a pineapple fix.)  Also, this recipe is going straight into the motorhome as this will be a great treat to make when we are traveling.  I just can't believe how easy and how good!!!   This is  winner, -Kathi- !!!!!"
2000520043,347323,2015-10-04,5,The best recipe!!
43642,187955,2006-11-27,5,This is everything Redsie promises.  You have to like mustard though - it's definitely the dominant flavor.  We really enjoyed this different dish.  Thank you!
532510,38046,2007-08-26,4,"These are good beans...I was hoping for more though. My daughter, 7, is a total bean nut and she was totally unimpressed.  (and yes I know beer does not completely cook out so maybe it was that flavor...)
I added a ton of salt to them at the end- otherwise followed the recipe exactly(even doubling it).
Sorry=("
11176,97761,2006-09-19,5,"WhooHoo!  Fast, easy, DELICIOUS!  Tested it on some heated French bread and darned near polished the whole shebang off. Can't wait to get it on a steak... like filet mignon.  Thanks, georgi!"
464080,152072,2013-03-05,5,Love this no fat dressing!  I can't wait to try it with a flavored honey such as rosemary or orange blossom.  I used Grey Poupon but next time will try stoneground.  It did thicken up a bit in the fridge and was tasty. Perfect for our diet!
383853,305697,2008-10-07,4,"This was a yummy soup.  It is simple to put together if you have the onions and chicken cut up and the tomatoes and beans drained beforehand.  I did think though that for having ""fiesta"" in the title it wasn't spicy enough, lol.  To my serving I added some shakes of Chalula (hot sauce).  I liked it much better that way, it was a bit too bland for me otherwise.  I think next time I make it I will try to use a can of Rotel instead of the mexican stewed tomoatoes.  Then the tomatoes will be cut up smaller plus add a lot more heat then the mexican stewed tomatoes had.  This was a nice filling soup.  Thanks for posting!"
455163,295832,2009-07-31,5,Its summer time and the garden has lots of summer squash coming on this is great and the boys love it.  I rate it A #1 great.  thanks
488244,221743,2007-12-23,5,"Loved this method!  This was my first roast chicken, and I wasn't disappointed.  I did two chickens and used a BBQ rub on them.  Moist and delicious, it was enjoyed by all!  Thank you :)"
274913,85172,2009-01-28,5,"LOVE this soup. I make it at least once a month. It's super easy & cheap to make. I use four cans of minced clams (with juice) and one bottle of clam juice, 2 carrots, three celery stalks, and I add corn cut off of four cobs. Once you chop everything (which you can easily do during the first 45-minute stretch) it's just dump-in and wait. And the flavor is amazing! Soooo delicious."
954555,359844,2009-03-24,5,"Oh FT. I must say these are the best scones Ive ever had, followed your advice and did miniture ones and served them as appetisers, with my own spreads, 
everyone lovethem. thank you so much for sharing this lovely receipe, its one I'll be repeating, and SOON!!!"
41370,8972,2014-01-20,0,"I have made this recipe numerous times and I really need to give this author credit because as long as it takes, it is worth every second!  This Red Velvet is beautiful to look at and as moist and delicious as anything else I have ever tasted!  I cook 3 layers in 8&quot;round cake tins.  I also serve this cake cold as I think it really brings out the moistness of the cake without falling apart.  And I love cold frosting!  Thank you again!!!"
2001278155,100927,2016-12-01,0,I made these and indeed they almost melted off my baking sheet! I think the recipie indicates too much butter.
1517485,292231,2010-01-10,5,Awesome recipe! Very filling
463202,134820,2008-06-18,5,"So delicious, so moist.  I made some mini ones for lunchboxes, and they were definitely the best thing in the box!  Thank you for posting, made for ZWT4 . . . but I will be making these again! :)"
1027074,8972,2012-04-30,3,"I made this for my anniversary because I wanted to try something that would have a ""wow"" factor.  That said, I prefer the red velvet cake made with oil.  To me, this cake lacked moistness (and it wasn't overcooked).  It was much better at room temperature than cold.  The icing was a trick - I made two batches of the milk/flour mixture before I was able to get *most* of the lumps out - even adding the milk gradually while using an electric mixer I was unable to get all the lumps out so I settled for getting it mainly lump free.  When heating the flour/milk, start with your burner on very low and when it clings to the surface of your whisk or spoon then its thick enough.  At least that was thick enough for me.  The icing did have a nice smooth texture, but, I think for red velvet I prefer the cream cheese and confectioners sugar icing.  Glad I tried it, but, I won't be making it again."
993604,319432,2009-12-04,5,"Yummy!  I used plain non-fat yogurt, 2% milk, and soy protein because that is what I keep on hand.  I only used frozen strawberries and left out the ice.  I did end up tripling the peanut butter :-)  I also added a little sweetener.  Thank you for a great smoothie recipe.  Made for PRMR."
136511,230894,2008-04-24,3,"I was really happy with how quickly the chicken legs were cooked.  Im not really sure that I cared for the taste of the bisquick coating, but I think thats just me.  Im a picky eater.  I think this is a good recipe for a quick weeknight dinner and I think it would be a kid pleaser.  Thanks for posting!"
62264,347436,2012-01-27,5,"Total success!  Had plenty of ginger I grated using coarse microplane.   Turned out great! Versatile too - great on toasty buttery English muffins at breakfast, fresh scones in the afternoon & as the middle of a 2 layer lemon cake.  Have given away 2 tiny jars - am coveting the rest. Made 4 1/2 pints (which I canned in 1/2 & 1/4 pint pretty jars).  Very clear & sparkly set too."
29782,192178,2007-11-23,5,YUM! this is a outstanding recipe! I made this for my step son for Thanksgiving and he loved it as did everyone else. I used Recipe #23724 for a topping. I will be keeping this recipe for future making :)  Thanks for sharing the recipe Chef~V !!
726393,227271,2008-11-08,4,Very tasty.  Makes a lot!
167225,117934,2006-03-20,4,"I used whole wheat penne, and thought it went well with the strong flavors here. Easy and good."
2412137,493882,2017-01-14,4,"This turned out pretty well. Bad thing about making breakfast casseroles in the slow cooker is the cheese on top gets dark and you miss that cheese flavor. Out of all the breakfast casseroles I've made this turned out the best. I was apprehensive putting raw meat in with eggs and everything because thats a lot of grease sitting in there. So, I went ahead and cooked my sausage and then put everything together, I didnt have onion or peppers on hand but will add next time. This was a last minute deal. Thanks for the recipe."
39835,240163,2007-07-21,5,Delicious salad and a great way to use some of the mint (spearmint) which is growing rampant in our garden. We had this for supper with fish so I skipped step 2. I also didn't measure my amounts but used 1 whole cantalope and one whole honeydew plus 1 lime and a bunch of mint leaves which I picked out of the yard. I think the leftover salad will make a wonderful breakfast with yogurt. Thanks for sharing this keeper!
151565,95601,2004-07-18,4,"Sounds like, like the ones my aunt used to make.

Julie"
166751,155186,2009-04-28,5,The entire family was a member of the clean plate club last night with this recipe!  That certainly doesn't happen often around here.  Maybe next time I'll add some diced jalepenos to spice it up a bit.  Thanks for a great recipe!
934536,11595,2009-05-15,4,"Great flavor, but my cake totally fell apart.  I ended up tearing it into little pieces and layering it with cool whip in an 8X8 dish.  It tasted really good- I will make it again, but I would like for the ""cake"" to actually look like the picture!"
748565,76273,2010-01-15,5,"AMAZING! I used a homemade chili sauce recipe #180046, which made it even more divine! The sauce was absolutely perfect and the meat fell apart beautifully! I think I will make this again for my church pot luck coming up on sunday!"
658188,108320,2008-02-04,5,"To me these were kinda blah but I am pretty sure it was fault of my own so I won't dock stars.  I was in a hurry, sliced my thumb big time and had to mush the ingredients together with one hand.  I also used packaged cheese, cheap lowfat sausage and should have used fresh garlic but was in too much pain and hurry to do it.  I will make them again with better ingredients and I'm sure they will be better"
61660,61769,2004-04-20,5,This was a very yummy dip.  We served it with crackers.  It was pretty much my dinner last night.  I did add a little more bacon and also chopped up the mushrooms.  Very easy to make and tasty.
122577,92390,2006-09-01,4,"What a wonderfully light fish dish.  Perfect for the warm summer months.  This was especially great because I was able to use some of the tomatoes and parsley from our garden.  (Nothing beats fresh foods!)  I did substitute basil for the tarragon and mint, because this is what I had on hand.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as instructed.  We really loved this dish!"
493093,356577,2012-12-11,1,"The time/temp. combination seemed WILDLY off. When I cooked this the top was dry and developed a big crack, the center was clean to testing, and after cooling, over 90% of the cake part was wet, soggy, and tasted of uncooked flour."
215014,121396,2006-11-03,5,This is great! Loved it with the guacamoly and the olive oil really made my tastebuds dance.  Will make it again!
273025,99059,2006-07-21,4,"Very Yummy! I actually put the pesto in the meat as well as inside the burger, and it turned our great! Loved the pesto-mayo!"
207176,22557,2009-01-05,5,"Easy, nice and tasty!  I seasoned my bone-in chops before browning with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Then I used the 1/2 packet of ranch dressing mix for the chops and followed your advice for the rest of the mix in the rice. My son commented that he really loved the rice.  The chops were juicy as others said.  Thanks for an easy and good recipe."
195400,117255,2005-05-03,5,"Wow made the bergers everyone enjoyed them this will be a keeper. The only thing I did diferant was I had to use 2 rolls I could not git 1 to come out to 7"".But other then that they were enjoyed by all .
"
30534,72346,2003-11-02,5,"Excellent! It's amazing how something so simple can be so delicious. I choose this dish to accompany a very rich entree. I made 1/2 the recipe as directed adding only white pepper and letting it sit 10 minutes before serving. The butter transforms canned beef broth into a fresh tasting beefy au jus. The 2 of us devoured what was supposed to be 4 servings. This goes into my book of ""special tricks"" !  "
31914,22558,2002-04-30,5,"I made this the other night, gave one loaf to a neighbour and the other loaf was devoured within 30 minutes!!!!!! It didn't quite rise as much in the pan as I had hoped but it sure tasted yummy!"
353131,10404,2008-08-07,5,"Made a mistake with these. I did not heat the pickling mixture. But, it doesn't seem to have hurt them in the least. These are WONDERFUL!!!!!!!! I have canned pickles for years and you just can't seem to get them as crispy as these are. Thanks for a great and greatly appreciated recipe!!!"
227750,59668,2006-10-12,5,EXCELLENT Rizogalo EV!!!  The  combo of vanilla extract  and lemon zest adds a nice touch!  BEST Rizogalo HANDS DOWN!  Thanks for sharing another winner! 
670246,25087,2008-03-02,5,I really love how simple and easy this rice recipe was! Absolutely delicious! I really think that you could even use beef broth and the flavor would be fantastic!! Thanks for such a great recipe!
169017,167202,2007-01-22,5,"Great recipe, super easy.  Great for busy nights.  Do be careful though with the one review...egg substitute is 1 point where regular eggs are 2.  It probably won't make a difference in the recipe spread over the number of servings though."
162826,200572,2009-10-10,5,"Marsha, This really hits the mark. Great flavors and lots of crispiness. I did make a little ahead to let the patties set up in the fridge for easier frying. YUMMY!"
33588,70722,2004-01-12,5,"These were the best brownies,I wouldn't change anything.Thanks
5stars is not enough!!!!"
1040393,299075,2009-04-21,5,"So easy and we loved that it was kind of low fat. I so enjoy trying these zarr keepers, thanks for a lovely dinner."
515357,43908,2008-12-30,5,"I'm pregnant and these have been my go to craving relief for months now.  Way better than any restaurant.  Love it, thanks."
1174071,121350,2009-06-04,0,I thought the muffins were very dry and seemed to be missing vegetable oil or something.  The texture was very odd.
400708,210056,2018-09-13,5,"Oh Joy, like so many of your recipes this one has it all, easy, tasty and so pretty. Made it for company and topped with a creamy, sausage recipe and everyone is already asking for the recipe. This is for sure a TEN stare winner"
2001804764,301754,2017-11-18,0,My 16 year old daughter made this and followed the directions to a T and it turned out perfect!
740480,30602,2009-01-30,4,This bread was great and I will be making it again.   I spread butter and sprinkled cinnemon but forgot the sugar.   It was still good.   I used good bubbly starter and yet it still took 5 hours to rise with most of the rise coming in the last hour.    Next time I will roll it tighter and not forget the sugar.   We love this as toast even when just baked.
440562,191274,2007-02-26,4,"My family loved it and I liked it.  I added sliced fresh mushrooms, which I sauteed.  I used mushroom soup with roasted garlic in it and added extra garlic and adobo seasoning to the mix.  I also used Redpack crushed tomatoes with Italian seasoning in it and Kraft shredded Italian mix of cheeses.  I didn't understand what the 1 1/2 cups of water was at the end, being that I cooked the noodles first, so I omitted it.
I served it with grated Parmesan cheese at the table."
1958841,363821,2014-04-19,5,I made these for an Easter egg hunt / party. They were a huge hit with kids and adults alike. Yum! Thanks for a great and creative idea!
829250,390256,2014-09-15,3,"I have used this before. Its ok! I think if you poke holes in the chicken and marinate over night, it would be better. I did it for 6 hours and grilled. Flavor didn&#039;t really come thru."
349458,89451,2012-01-22,5,"After reading the other reviews I decided to make this with a little twist.  I started by frying half a package of bacon in the stew pot.  I removed the bacon then used the grease (which was about 1/4 of a cup and added only 1/4 of a cup butter to make the half cup of butter it called for in the recipe) I cooked the remainder just as called for in the recipe except I didn't have the extra clam juice, I only had the juice from the cans of clams.  Oh and I added a can of corn and the cooked bacon in the last 5 minutes of cook time, and waited until the last 5 minutes to add the clams so they wouldn't over cook. (I also waited to add the potatoes because I cooked them completely before adding and I didn't want them to turn to mush in the soup) I seasoned the soup as called for in the recipe and added a dash of cayenne pepper to it.  It was so great that my husband who isn't a soup eater had 2 bowls of it."
104295,117153,2006-06-15,4,"Definitely easy and fast.  I used fat free sour cream and it was fine.  I think it probably needed some salt.  I think I still prefer cucumbers with a red wine vinegar sauce, but this is a quick and easy nice veggie side.  "
314018,108631,2006-04-27,5,I served this at girls night a year or two ago.  Not only was it popular that night but my friend has asked me to serve it at her bridal shower.
146486,24003,2006-12-19,5,"Oh my goodness, this is soooo good!!  I love the flavor of this soup and it is so very easy.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks MizzNezz, you always have the best recipes!"
1455684,52486,2009-12-02,5,"I made this recipe before I joined 
'Zaar.  It was decadent.  I added a clove of garlic to the sauce, and used a chicken recipe my mom had on hand.  I left out the pancetta, and my mom doesn't like artichoke hearts or capers, so it had some empty spots in it.  My dad said it tasted like the Brio's scallopini.  (The Brio is this very nice Tuscan franchise).  I will make it again, but only for special occasions  (that's a lot of butter!)"
72483,92096,2004-06-15,5,"I didn't make it....but I TASTED IT and had to review this recipe!!! My friend made it and my dh and I were at her house and the fragrance of the sauce called out my name. She graciously gave us a sample and we can't stop talking about how amazing it tasted! I LOVE oregano, BUT I didn't even notice that it was missing...it wasn't needed. Anyone who had actually made the recipe might have know that! Thanks Allie!"
2000731609,223206,2015-12-06,5,"Great recipe lovely flavours. Just need to double up on all ingredients. If you are going to go through all that time and  effort to make it, trust me you need to double up.Every one is going to want seconds? I used 1kg of Lamb Knuckle (great meat for a potjie) with the lamb neck. Then rather add the potatoes an hour before it is almost done, they don&#039;t need more cooking otherwise you will no whole  potatoes to enjoy."
520092,56322,2008-08-15,5,"Mmmm!! This is sooo good! I did change it slightly, I used yellow cake mix instead of butter since that was all I had on hand. It turned out perfectly! Some other comments say it was too buttery to add any more butter when you eat them, well that  is certainly not the case if you use yellow cake mix. It tastes very similar to Boston Market's Cornbread, it does still have the cornmeal texture and is not too sweet at all. It sure does make a whole lot of them- I used 2 round cake pans and 12 muffins! Thank you for posting this great recipe!"
128473,255672,2008-02-07,5,"This was delicious 2Bleu, each forkful was a treasure. A new and exciting flavour in every bite. I loved all the different flavours and textures in this dish, they all blend perfectly together, complimenting one another beautifully. Thank you so much for sharing, we hope you don't have to sleep with the fishes...Kato"
381180,53208,2012-03-31,4,"I roasted whole almonds for a total of 10 minutes, stirring only once at 5 minutes.  When I opened the oven at 10 minutes to stir them again, the oven was filled with smoke and I thought my smoke detector would alarm!  I immediately removed them from the oven to cool underneath my range hood fan!  Much of the pepper was left on the bottom of my pan, and I don't detect any hint of sweetness!  Made for Peppercorns~Black Pepper Recipe Tag,  March 2012, in the Photo Forum."
44383,78897,2005-08-04,5,"My husband, a man of superior wisdom and knowledge, poo poo'd this and was figuring on another one of those ""hungry"" nights when I told him what was for dinner.  My husband went back for seconds and so did I.  Great recipe, a keeper in my house and I made it exactly as directed.  Thanks for a great one, Fluffy. And for helping me make my husband eat his words yet again. ;-)"
319943,247722,2009-02-06,5,"Tasty, but rich!  I used roasted red pepper alfredo sauce and a jar of garlic alfredo sauce.  I thought I had a jar of roasted red peppers, but it turned out to be sundried tomatoes, so I omitted those.  I cooked the noodles, personal preference.  The result was a thick, rich, delectable meal that my husband termed ""a keeper."""
1802566842,16705,2014-03-10,2,"I took them out of the pot at least an hour earlier than the recipe stated.  If I had continued to cook them (on lo) the full recommended time, it would have cooked the bones, too.  they were just soup with bones floating around.  Didn&#039;t like the way it turned out."
28346,173042,2009-02-06,3,"Made this last week for the cook-a-thon.  I'm not sure how thick it's supposed to get but I didn't find this to be a very thick soup.  Also I didn't find the flavor to be all that cheesey which was surprising.  The addition of an 8 oz bag of shredded cheddar helped, and the second time we ate this I mixed up some corn starch and water and added it in to the hot soup.  At that point we had a very thick and enjoyable soup.  We ate the thickened version of this soup over big baked potatoes one night and really enjoyed that presentation.  The flavor of this soup continues to improve with age as is so often the case.  I'm glad I tried it."
311625,104409,2009-01-11,5,"Man I'm losing it, I swear I've reviewed this recipe before (this is the second time in a week!). Took me a while to find it, but it's so good I couldn't quit looking till I did. This is the perfect batter for real fish and chips, not the crap the sell in restaurants most places outside of the northeast and Michigan. Thanks so much for posting, I've been fiending every since we moved 8 years ago!"
632657,192998,2009-01-31,4,"These are very delicious. Rich and buttery. I used walnuts in place of the pecans and sprinkled them in the bottom of the pan (I thought they would stay there, but they all floated to the top). Also, I thought this was WAY too much caramel for a 9x9-inch pan, unless you like really thick pieces. I actually ended up using a 9x13-inch pan. Nevertheless, I LOVE caramels, any kind of caramels, and this one goes on my favorites list :)"
83961,154233,2006-09-01,5,This was excellent!  One of my new favorite recipes!  I only had a pound of beef so I made it in an 11X7 pyrex dish and used a little less of everything.  I also used whole wheat tortillas & Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of a separate can of chilies.  It was also great as leftovers!
1366254,404472,2011-04-20,4,"very good and like you said, very moist.. many a recipe came into my recipe box via pampered chef parties"
220166,99086,2007-07-05,5,These were awesome!!  We have been trying to eat more healthy and these fit right in!!  I used 2 eggs whites in place of a whole egg and added some pepper to spice it up a bit!  Great recipe KC!  Thanks for posting!!
741494,31717,2009-10-12,5,"Wonderful soup, full of flavor! I took this to a pot luck and everyone enjoyed it. I will be making this again soon. I followed the directions exactly, except I cooked the pasta separate since I was taking it somewhere. I did not want the pasta to keep cooking in the pot. Oh, and I made this stove top because I do not have a crock pot large enough."
104902,60816,2006-12-02,5,"Excellent crust - I made the dough in the bread machine, rubbed it with oil then let it sit (covered) an extra 1/2 hour to raise then cut it in half and made 2 thin crust pizza's. Really good!"
25045,45107,2002-11-01,5,I had a tupperware party tonight and served this with ritz crackers. It is soooooo good! Everyone loved it. I must have given the recipe to at least 20 people. Thanks for posting this recipe.
638342,99992,2009-04-29,5,"My type of recipe: easy, tasty and with ingredients I always have on hand.  Just used it again for the second time...loved it!  Only thing I changed was subbing Splenda for sugar...cuz that's the way I roll.  I also used some of the marinade to flavor the steamed brown rice I served with it...simple and yummy :-9"
351424,75141,2006-09-11,4,"I really enjoyed this dish.  Great flavor, I would totally recommend trying this one.  I added double the ricotta, and it turned out great!"
194993,191504,2015-06-26,5,"My family really gobbled this up. I made one with a regular frozen pie crust and skipped all the pre-cooking steps, just threw the ingredients in the crust and baked it, and that worked fine. I made the other crust less. It was a little strange to put the cumin and chili powder in an empty pie plate, but it came out fine, too. Directions were good. Serving size was a bit confusing though. Overall, an excellent recipe."
1002329,119541,2008-10-25,5,"I've never made risotto before and wanted to use up some fresh mushrooms.  This was PERFECT!  Followed recipe exactly except substituted for romano cheese and fresh parsley. 

DH LOVED it and was very impressed.  I wondered how long it would take him to come home from work with fresh mushrooms so I'd make it again!  (about 1 week).  :-) 

Thank you!  This is a wonderful recipe."
58852,64283,2009-04-30,5,"Wow! I wish I could give this recipe MORE stars! I made this for a church dinner and it was the ONLY cake that was gone at the end!! I made the cake as directed, but did add a bit of fresh lemon juice and baked for a bit longer, as it didn't seem quite done in the center at 20 minutes. For the frosting, I used **POPPY**'s Luscious Lemon Frosting as written. This was the most wonderful combo!!! It was so dense and moist with an abundance of lemon tang! For lemon lovers, I suggest replacing the vanilla extract with fresh lemon juice or lemon extract. I made this as a sheet cake and it was puuurrrrfect!!!!! Thanks for a terrific recipe!"
1800054678,146514,2015-07-03,5,"Amazing! I omit the salt and found 1/3 cup flour was a little too much for the turkey dripping I had, so I added more water to reach to my desired thickness. Blend it in a food processor for a few second to get rid of the lumps. Really really good!"
2001670377,416878,2017-09-03,0,Why was it so soupy?
139594,30381,2004-05-20,3,"This dessert was very easy to prepare.  I used 6c. of rhubarb, chopped pecans and whipping cream.  It tasted delicious, however it was very soupy and i felt it lacked the texture that a crisp should have. I probably would not make this again.    "
1333451,5287,2009-08-03,5,I used a Pilsbury Golden Butter Reciple cake mix and chocolate chips.  They turned out wonderfully.  I cannot wait to try out other flavors!
762775,374329,2009-06-13,5,I was going to post myself and found that it was already here! I subscribe to Cooking Light and knew I had to try this one out. It's a change from the mango or pineapple salsas that you find and I love radishes. Served it over grilled tilapia but it also tastes great as a dip for salted chips since it's a little sweet the combo is nice.
2000294074,96253,2015-06-25,5,"I haven&#039;t made red potato salad in years. I made this recipe and tweaked it a little by using scallions, celery and just 1/4 of a green pepper.  
This was made for Fathers Day and every bit of it in a large bowl was gone. I thought I would be able to take some home. Nothing, was left."
42669,135753,2014-11-04,5,"This sounds like a perfect recipe for a 7# chicken that I am roasting. I&#039;ve read every single review and I am very surprised that a few mentioned dark soy but not one person actually named it correctly. It is called Tamari. Tamari has either no or very little wheat, while Soy sauce has a lot of wheat. Something to keep in mind if you are looking for gluten-free. Also the Tamari is a trad sweeter and much less salty. Secondly, if you&#039;ve never used Chinese 5-Spice, it is widely used in almost every Asian restaurant. It has a wonderful flavor unless you don&#039;t know how to cook with it. It&#039;s not like seasoning salt where you liberally apply it. It is a very potent mixture of spices and should be used SPARINGLY! A little goes a long way! Too much and you&#039;re not going to like it, as some of your have already discovered. Just saying that it is not always the recipe that is unfavorable. It sometimes is the cooks unfamiliarity with knowing how to cook with the ingredients."
2000852212,204257,2016-02-02,1,"Sorry, this wasn&#039;t good. It&#039;s way too salty, mostly because of the kalamata olives. The dish also expressed a ton of liquid out of the kale, resulting in mush. If you&#039;re going to precook leafy greens, you have to press the moisture out of it."
833875,99272,2009-01-13,5,These were so easy to make (to my surprise) and my kids said they were better than Cinnabon!  What more could you ask for?  This is great and I'll be making it again and again.  Thanks so much for the recipe....:)
1580204,409374,2010-06-07,3,"Far too much olive oil.  That's all I tasted when I cooked this.  When I try it again, I intend to use just enough olive oil to saute the scallops."
185446,42754,2009-06-09,4,"I tried this because of all the positive reviews, but found it to be very thick for a dressing, and as much as I love ginger, did not really enjoy its flavoring with tomatoes.  Make sure you like that combination before trying (now I know).  This seems more a dip or condiment than dressing."
522496,83789,2008-06-24,5,This is very easy and tastes great.  I did substitute 2/3 cup of oats for the flour in the streusel.  Wonderful recipe!
970098,172290,2009-06-23,5,Amazing! The only change I made was adding more peppers to the sauce. The burgers were scooped up faster than I could make them. :)
573325,301255,2009-10-02,5,"This is a truly yummy, easy and healthy recipe! I enjoyed every bite of it! The flavours of the earthy beetroot, the sweet carrot and tangy apple go really well together and make for a fresh salad experience.
THANKS SO MUCH for sharing your recipe with us, Chef! Ill make it again!
Made and reviewed for Think Pink Event Octobre 09."
987323,26676,2009-08-05,5,"Easy to make and a great alternative to cow's milk!  I didn't strain mine and it still tasted fine, although there were fine pieces throughout.  I also used brown sugar instead of maple syrup, and added a HUGE sqeeze of honey!  For reference, this recipe is actually the base for the milk, you adjust it with more water to your personal liking.  I'm definitely keeping this recipe!"
488441,133143,2009-04-06,5,"Call the neighbors--it's time for a margarita party! This is fantastic! It is similar to a recipe my mom used to make, but she didn't add the Corona beer--I would say ADD the beer--it makes the difference! Made and reviewed for Pick a chef, Spring 2009. Great drink recipe!"
2495491,203646,2014-12-26,5,"I made the mayo mixture, came out pretty good. I used a food processor to process the ingredients and used half of a lime.  Awesome sauce!"
133174,161324,2006-02-25,5,We really enjoyed this.  I did use Patka's Hot Curry Paste.  I left off the rum and garnished with plain yogurt and sweet paprika and recommended.  This is a good soup and I wish you luck in the contest.
115758,125017,2006-04-27,5,"The kids loved this one. I used ultra lean beef, which I think is essential for good results in this recipe. We ate it hot with mash and veg...n I look forward to cooking it again and taking it along to picnic and eaten cold."
222564,76610,2008-12-19,5,Fantastico! I added a drizzle of balsamico alng with the olive oil.
394204,43923,2007-08-19,5,"Loved the texture...more like mini cakes, very soft, great flavor. My kid was clueless it was full of pumpkin as well."
1383666,70654,2009-09-14,5,I Loved the dressing and or dip. Easy to make and keep. I would make this again and again.
125218,79421,2005-05-05,5,Absolutely delicious. This is perfect for the dark chocolate lover. I used dove dark chocolate bars and added slivered almonds on top. I like my chocolate on the goey side so I only cooked them 9 minutes. Perfect!
48902,23779,2011-07-02,5,"This was great!  Loved the ""BBQ"" sauce this made.  Very easy to throw together.  With the leftover sauce I put it over some cooked chicken breast tenderloins and placed it in the frig.  It was a fantastic snack.  Thanks Denise for sharing this.  Can't wait to make it for the next potluck."
2001693735,56351,2018-04-25,5,Moma made something similar. She would make a slit in the hot dogs and put a thick strip of cheddar cheese in the slit. Then wrap it with bacon and pin it with toothpicks soaked in waterror and bake them in a 350&deg; oven.
1219702,79316,2010-01-18,5,"Great soup -- easy to make and tastes great. I needed to cut the sodium so left out the soy, used a lo-sodium chix stock and El Yucateco chipotle sauce. For pasta, I used the Spanish 'fideos'. It turned out surprisingly thick -- nice one Denise!"
266635,454935,2014-03-12,5,"Wonderful dish!  Great flavor and very easy to make.  Loved the addition of the cauliflower and raisins.  The only change I made was to leave out the apples -- just our preference.  Will definitely make this dish again.  Made for Everyday is a Holiday, March, 2014."
153141,143667,2006-05-20,5,this was the first cake i've ever made and it was great.the frosting came out more like a thick glaze but tasted really good.the shaved white chocolate was beautiful with some of the lemon zest sprinkled over it.
40193101,114392,2014-01-20,5,Prefect sauce. Made only one change and that was I pureed the sauce before I added the spices. My family loved it and they are very picky. I made extra an from it in small batches for later.
37722,194460,2007-12-27,4,"Great Stuffing for Everyone! First off, I have to say that I don't like liver by itself - the texture throws me off. But I used to have a recipe for stuffed pork chops that included diced, sauteed chicken livers and it was so delicious. The liver adds such great flavorand you don't know it's there! This recipe sounds the same. I will probably dice the liver before sauteing, but that's just me. Try this by all means!!"
82616,111609,2006-03-27,5,"We had this tonight with maincooncats potato dumplings, all I can say it NUMMY!!! Great way to do up chicken. Thanks Molly."
488716,87420,2009-06-07,0,This was great. My whole family loved it and couldn't stop eating this great comfort food.
498271,184086,2007-11-30,5,"I loved these potatoes!  I took a shortcut and used thawed hash browns instead of cooking potatoes, otherwise made just as directed - easy and terrific!"
208679,65297,2008-11-10,5,"ABSOLUTELY the best chicken burger yet!!!!  I doubled recipe and cooked all.  Frooze the extras in freezer bags with squares of parchment paper in between to bring to work and microwave for an awesome lunch!!!  I cooked on each side then basted with sauce for about 1 min on each side. Oh forgot, I didnt have chili sauce so I added chili powder and as others omitted the salt due to the saltiness of the teryaki, did add some ground pepper for personal preference. Served on lettuce, with awesome sauce, no bun needed here!!! Pineapple on the side goes well with these burgers too.  THANK YOU FOR AN A+ RECIPE!!!!"
188848,29765,2010-03-29,5,This is definitely a do-again! Made for Valentines Day 2010. I actually had cranberry stilton in my cheese drawer - a good suggestion. Thanks for sharing!
350812,50737,2006-11-24,5,"Quick & easy for Thanksgiving!  I used Bisquick light and the light sour cream.  I was also going to use diet Sprite, but thought that this recipe might need *some* sugar in it!  I just dropped them onto my cooking stone in blobs of about 2-3T in size, and then sprayed a bit of butter on the top to cook.  They looked FINE & were nice and soft.  Not quite like Popeye's...but probably b/c I used less butter than they did!  YUMMM!!"
68960,78970,2003-12-21,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe.  I used chicken breasts and cut into strips, let it marinade for 1/2 a day and found the flavors went right through the chicken. Cooked it on the BBQ and served with a salad.
Thanks for posting this fantastic, quick and easy recipe.
"
857580,220067,2009-02-01,5,"When I saw this on tv, I thought the lime flavor might be overwhelming, but it is very subtle. I doubled the recipe and ran out of limes, so I used the stuff in the little plastic lime and they were still awesome. Definitely worth the extra trouble of marinating and drying. I served with AB's guac, which is the perfect gauc recipe."
246742,15248,2005-09-27,4,"Good recipe, I only recommend more onions and cheese, that's just a personal preference!"
2424936,123538,2013-01-13,5,"This recipe is terrific! I didn't add any sweetener and was great without.  It took less than a minute in my vitamix, definitely a keeper."
1179225,367779,2014-04-22,5,"Wow! This is one delicious cocktail! Really smooth, not too sweet. I used fresh squeezed oj and think that&#039;s the ticket with this one. Thanks for the keeper recipe."
1131605,20492,2010-01-06,5,This was delicious. I used the suggestion of one of the reviewers to serve it with a spring green salad and cherry tomatoes.  The sauce made a great salad dressing.  I also served garlic bread.  My husband said he felt like he was at a really good restaurant.
1537761,32369,2010-02-20,5,"I couldn't wait to try my hand at making a batter bread. This was the first time I was going to attempt something with yeast in it (I am always making quick breads) so I was nervous. But it was beautifully baked and just the right consistency and texture! :) Thanks for the recipe, MissNez!"
305531,184516,2006-12-05,5,"Very simple and very tasty. I used leftover horseradish sauce from Recipe #186485, tomato, lettuce, and used the sauce on the side for dipping, which all made a great sandwich. Thanks Lainey6605."
439174,267387,2013-09-28,5,"Outstanding flavor!  I served with Spanish rice, sour cream, lettuce &amp; tomato with warm tortillas.....oh sooooo good.  Thank you!"
146486,130223,2008-04-14,5,These were good and a nice change from the yellow cake version.  I bet it would be good with fresh strawberries in it too!
356927,322858,2010-07-14,5,"These are excellent. I did it with both crunch & creamy peanut butter both were yummy. Good little snack prior to a work out. I rolled mine into little balls instead of a disk,  then put them in snack bags ~ great for on-the-go."
865936,397640,2010-06-27,5,Wow!  We loved this!  It has just the right amount of spice and heat.  Made for ZWT #6 - ZINGO.
2001326840,52272,2016-12-29,5,This was delish I did change the recipe no bacon I saut&eacute;ed the onions and GARLIC in butter then added clam juice and two potatoes I also used cream mushroom soup instead of cream celery also 4oz cream cheese this soup was the best clam chowder I've had since I was at a fresh sea food house in California yumm thank you
113509,12316,2009-07-27,5,"We had this for dinner over the weekend. Hubby did the frying in our fryer instead of a pan, and I made the gravy. We cut the recipe in half, and I didn't use any drippings in the gravy (since we were using our big fryer) but the gravy was still really tasty. I served it with Jalapeno Cheese Grits. All in all, we really enjoyed this recipe, and will make it again. thanks for posting."
49879,84401,2007-05-21,5,"I was so happy to find this recipe, it is one of my family favorites and some how I misplaced the recipe.  I like to serve this with my Chicken Caesar Salad #78140"
1362621,201915,2009-08-24,5,What a great dish! And so cute! The pasta shells are probably easier to fill than pasta like manicotti. Could sub seasoned rice vinegar for lemon juice for added flavor.
330505,80896,2008-12-02,5,"This got rave reviews at the ladies fellowship tonight. I didn't get to actually taste any, but based on all the comments I'm giving this 5 stars.  I didn't add the alfalfa sprouts as the store was out and I added a touch of splenda to the dressing, cuz I like mine a little sweet.  Thanks for posting Sue L!!"
2000847475,117532,2016-01-31,5,"Quick, Easy, great results! Rolled my dough thin and it was perfect! Made a 12&times;18&quot; size. Baked for 15 min then broiled for 3 min."
219865,204682,2009-05-15,4,these are very very tasty and quick to reheat
71324,196753,2007-04-08,5,"This deserves every single of those five stars. It takes a little time to make, but it's not much effort really once you have chopped the veg and well worth every minute. My meat loving BF said that surely vegetables couldn't taste this good and it's healthy to boost!
I used vegetable stock instead of the reserved cooking liquid to thin the sauce a little and I didn't have any parsley, so I just used a little more basil and thyme (I don't really like parsley much anyways). The only thing I would change would be to add the garlic with the tomatoes, as roasting it minced for twenty minutes at that temperature meant that it just got brown and started to taste bitter. Luckily you couldn't taste it in the end result though. This is a brilliant dish that will definitely become one of the regulars in this house. Thanks for sharing."
383346,317201,2009-04-29,5,This is so good.  I used boneless pork chops.  They were in the marinade overnight.  They were very tender.  I used fresh italian parsley and fresh mint.  I omitted the orange zest and cumin.  Thanks Crafty Lady.  Made for Bevy tag :)
414666,12549,2007-04-14,5,My mom was taken aback by these...absolutely fabulous
231137,139366,2010-10-02,5,"Good recipe, but the ingredients could be clarified. The ingredients say ""par-boiled cooked rice"". I suspect this just means regular parboiled rice out of the bag, right? <br/><br/>Usually idli batter is made from either raw rice or parboiled rice (which looks pretty much like raw rice). Parboiled rice is rice that was partially boiled and then sun dried before dehusking and packaging. Supposedly this process (1) causes some of the nutrition from the husk to go into the rice grain; (2) changes the starch so that it cooks more quickly; (3) makes softer idli than raw rice does."
356850,244505,2014-10-19,3,This pretty good but not sure that I would fix it again.
69838,101104,2006-01-04,5,Thanks for posting this recipe.  I was in dire need of the recipe b/c I couldnt find the can wrapping off of the pumpkin puree LOL.  I too baked in a glass pie pan and it makes for easy cutting and removal :) I used just a bit more cinnamon  to our tastes. Delicious! Thanks!
498271,432088,2011-03-26,4,"Very flavorful carrot dish!  I had to use dried parsley, otherwise made as directed.  I really liked the cumin with the carrots; next time I'll add a dash of lemon juice as well.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for Spring Pick-A-Chef 2011"
142559,80482,2009-08-16,5,"This was soooo good! I used fresh bing cherries as that it what I had on hand and needed to use them before they went bad. I used 6 cups of cherries and I doubled the ingredients for the crisp (we like lots of crisp) and baked in a 9x9 square pan.  Came out beautifully! Hubby is making ""nom-nom"" noises! Thanks for posting! :)"
382071,246997,2007-09-14,4,This was a VERY NICE salad. My husband just about gobbled it all up and didn't eat much of the other 2 things I made. I had to sub mustard greens for the beet leaves because I couldn't find any fresh looking beet leaves. I also added 1 clove of minced garlic and fresh ground black pepper. I made a half recipe for Zaar Tag.
39762,28750,2004-03-29,5,This was a really nice and different way to serve peas. The bacon and sage added a nice flavor.
864348,124241,2009-06-21,5,"This recipe is so easy and the results are quite tasty.  My family loved it.  I read a review that called this dish a little bland.  Make sure to cook the macaroni in salted water and don't be afraid to hit the egg with some salt, too.  If something tastes bland, season it.  Thanks for the recipe.  It is a keeper."
1482616,316180,2009-12-14,5,Perfect! I searched through a variety of internet recipes and settled on this one. The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp. of ginger. The cookies were crisp with a soft bite and had that authentic dutch windmill taste. Yum!
218535,105726,2015-01-19,5,Very good. We reduced the amount of parmesan for our taste.
142335,107997,2007-11-20,5,I've been experimenting with this since it's so delicious and easy. Last night I also added fresh chopped tomatoes and green onions. I removed the shrimp from the grill pan and grilled fresh crusty bread in the juices. Then I served the shrimp on top of the bread. The bread and the shrimp were amazing. This is now my favorite way to serve this dish. I wish I had remembered to take a picture it was beautiful!
2655367,209114,2013-01-24,5,Delicious! The flavors really combine in a wonderful way.  I made it tonight and it took me by surprise.  Thanks for the concise and helpful recipe.
642099,215631,2011-01-25,0,"Love this recipe! The smoked paprika is a must, gives the greens a wonderful flavor. This recipe has become the standard at my house."
146486,63073,2007-11-29,2,"Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a beautiful cake, but unfortunately nobody cared for the taste.  I was so excited to make this after reading all the wonderful reviews, but it just didn't work for us. Mine was done in 1 hour."
166642,462289,2011-08-31,5,Wonderful! I made exactly as directed using real bacon and it is very good. A great snack for my family. Thanks for sharing.
897493,66947,2009-08-15,5,Great drink!  Can't wait to make another pitcher!
742667,73825,2008-02-17,5,I'm sure you don't need another review but I just made this for my mothers birthday and....It was a HUGE hit! Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!
195870,91106,2005-03-12,5,I make these a lot with any large white or yellow onion. I just use the beef bullion cube.  I don't put butter in with it. This is delicious and has fewer calories than a baked potato. 
3810,249,2000-12-18,4,"These were incredibly easy and fast to make.  They stored well in the refrigerator...I brought them to my organization's holiday potluck on a nice paper plate.  They all went quickly, so there was no cleanup or any leftovers to take back home.  PS--my coworkers liked them!"
91392,27993,2004-08-22,5,"DH gives this a 5, me a four.  He has never had a cannoli, and I think that is the difference.  I thought it was good, and very fast and easy, but was missing a cannoli taste that I can't put my finger on.  I think it would make a very easy, quick and good filling for a plain chocolate cake, or even a white cake, and that is how I plan on using it next.  Thanks!"
1377630,22539,2009-09-18,5,Very easy to make and delicious! Next time I will use more pasta sauce as mine turned out a little dry at the top.
1041521,185603,2009-10-11,5,"These turned out great!  I used one cup of whole wheat flour, and two cups of white.  Delicious!"
245429,163391,2008-12-14,5,"Also added one onion as others suggested and used a few more slices of bacon.  After pureeing the mixture, I added about 1/4 cup of heavy cream to give it an even richer flavor.  Delicious!!"
270842,56366,2006-10-05,5,Rave reviews from my family. My sister in law isn't too crazy about ground beef but she gave it more praise than anyone else. Thanks for a simple recipe that I can make over and over again. 
134289,107059,2008-11-29,5,I ran out of pumpkin pie spice.  I found this recipe.  It's easy ---why bother buying this spice when I already have the ingredients on hand.  I usually only need pp spice once a year.
305531,226963,2007-06-21,5,Great corn! The lime juice was a good flavor to accompany a Mexican salmon dish. Thanks Cookin'Diva.
7544,15843,2005-03-17,5,Fantastic!  The kids polished off this loaf in a matter of minutes!
1219679,404834,2011-09-22,2,"We gave it a try, but it tasted like grass with garlic!"
2001508689,486641,2017-04-26,5,"I am not sure how this is much different than other Banana bread recipes but man it sure is much better, so light and fluffy, not dense and heavy like most. I do not eat refined white sugar so used coconut sugar and upped it to 1 1/2 cups as it is not a sweet. Perfection!!!"
285039,259256,2008-03-17,5,"I am always looking for ways to get more calcium, so the boost in the AM from the yogurt helps. This has great flavor!  I used frozen peach slices and decreased the crushed ice to 1/3 cup.  For an extra boost of calcium add about a 1/3 cup powdered milk; it makes it more like a milk shake though!  Thanks for posting; I will be adding it to my morning breakfast rotation!"
2001953437,308034,2018-01-25,5,"Fantastic! Tried a greek pasta salad at my local deli and was determined to come home and make my own. This one is even better than what I tried! I went heavy on the garlic, mayo and pepper. Also used a penne pasta and roasted red bell pepper. Thank You!!!!"
1443660,302815,2012-12-27,4,"Very good and simple....you can spice it up a little and make it more of a meal by adding oregano, parsely, fresh ground pepper, and garlic salt to the butter and fresh garlic. Add cooked pasta to spiced melted butter stir to coat in skillet and then add ground cooked italian sausage, and cook until hot.  I also add 1 beated raw egg and stir in to past mixture and cook for an addidional minute.   Add parmesian cheese after pasta is on the plate.   Great for Lent by adding mushrooms instead of the italian sausage."
1340964,158292,2009-08-11,4,It was good. It had a very summery taste. I would add a little more garlic. All I could taste was lemon. I used basil which gave it a good flavor.
960191,99636,2008-09-23,5,"So far so good.  I'll update after it has cooled down, but so far I am very happy with this.  I just loved how easy it was.  I ended up with 12 8oz jars and a smallish tub to eat right away.  I didnot use any coloring and like it was suggested by another user I used juice in place of the water used in the second step.  My son and I fought over the pot and spoon it was so tasty!

Thanks for sharing this treat!"
65670,195511,2006-11-22,5,Loved it! Very easy to prepare. The lemon and orange zest pep it up. I added the raisins but not the nuts. Outstanding!!
1052873,348368,2014-09-22,5,A very different and tasty way to eat fruit. I used a backyard red apple of unknown variety. Made for CQ 14.
158087,37626,2005-08-20,4,Very tasty!  I really enjoyed the complexity of flavors created from so few ingredients. I would have loved it more if I had eaten it under a palapa on some small caye.  Maybe next time.
586291,83475,2008-05-18,5,"So good! I used chicken breasts instead of thighs and it was wonderful. The only thing I didn't do was add the basil at the end, because I forgot! But it still turned out awesome."
185446,18387,2007-01-08,4,"One reviewer commented they didn't like the thick sauce--that is exactly what we DID like!    Thanks for explicit directions, Manda--the enchiladas turned out perfect, and you can be sure this recipe will be made again."
39835,307010,2014-05-15,5,"This was great - I used 2% cottage cheese (didn&#039;t measure - but used the rest of the container) and my mushrooms were a 7 ounce can, otherwise made as directed. Served with mixed vegetables for a great and healthy dinner. Thanks for sharing!"
645094,284363,2008-05-28,4,"This was a great beer cheese recipe!  I didn't have any American cheese, so I used a mixture of Velveeta, cheddar, and marble jack.  Also used skim milk instead of half and half.  I didn't put them into the bread bowls, either. (My DH hates them.)  Turned out very creamy and delicious!  I threw in some broccoli and cauliflower for substance after the initial taste tasting.  Perfect portion size for two!  Thanks!"
993604,351040,2010-03-07,4,This was really good.  I used cavatappi pasta.  I substituted Guinness draught because I did not have the stout.  I ended up using closer to 3 tablespoons of butter.  I used Panko breadcrumbs.  Next time I will mix the butter into the breadcrumbs and then sprinkle the crumbs over rather than trying to drizzle the butter evenly over the casserole.    I think I will also up the cheese quantity just a bit.  Thanks for posting.
282745,180465,2006-09-20,5,"This was really good and is perfect for a light lunch.  I sure miss basil in the winter time so it was nice to be able to use what's left of my basil on this at the beginning of fall.  It would be perfect with a nice summer salad as well.  Thanks for a great recipe, it's a keeper!"
439261,133359,2007-11-12,4,I make these every Christmas. The only thing I do differently is to sprinkle a bit of coconut on top after icing.
39334,397443,2009-12-27,5,Oh man this is good stuff!!! We halved the recipe since there's only two of us but DH has been using it as a spread on sandwiches too so it's going quickly! Goes amazingly well with pretzels! So easy to mix up and very versatile as I can definitely see this as our new sandwich spread too! Thanks for posting! Made for your Football Pool Week 15 win...congrats!!!
33443,29301,2004-03-21,5,"Sue this was incredible. The chicken browned beautifuly, and left lots of great golden bits in the pan. I did need more oil for the onion, garlic stage. The smells were divine. I used Sultana raisins and let the whole thing simmer about 10 minutes so that the raisins got nice and plump. I then added the yogurt (1/2 of a small container)directly into the pan and it made the sauce nice and creamy(we don't like it on the side). Added some of the cilantro in the pan, but did use some to top off on the plate. Served with Basmati rice. The cilantro really makes a big difference here, I would not omit it, and fresh is the way to go. Thanks, BH who hates curry dishes, had two portions!"
15077,55514,2007-07-22,5,"Simply outstanding, like the five-stars suggest.  With this recipe, I have learned that almost all of the restaurant and ALL of the store-purchased blue cheese dressing has a chemical taste. However, this dressing is amazing.  I believe that the base dressing (without the blue cheese) could be used for many dressings such as ranch.  Cudo's!"
521211,84049,2008-11-18,5,"Absolutely delicioussss!  Loved these savory, slightly sweet muffins.  I used the sharp cheddar cheese with the parmesan and topped them with a milder cheddar cheese.  I will keep this recipe for sure in my favorites!  Thanks alot for sharing."
2002060568,194768,2018-03-18,5,I have made this recipe twice now. Both times it turned out better than the mashi in Egypt. The recipe is nearly perfect....I followed the recipe for the stuffing exactly.
1201109,316943,2009-05-30,5,"My wife really liked this bread and easy, not too many ingredients. I did use half & half white and brown rice flour. Didn't have packets of yeast so I used 2 tsp, plus I added a couple tbsp sugar and it rose really nice.

Excellent!!!"
76535,163827,2006-12-18,5,I tried this last 4th of July with Absolut Watermelon vodka. DIVINE!
36944,57408,2003-05-14,5,"I highly recommend these delicious, yet healthy treats!  I used the plastic popsicle molds from the store.  I halved the recipe and it made about 16 popsicles.  They are so easy to make.  The adults and kids have gone crazy eating them.  And since they're so healthy I let them!  Thanks Barb for a recipe that's already become a family favorite!"
216410,31750,2010-01-05,2,"I agree with the other recent poster that my waffle mix was very thin.  It too had lots of lumps, but I think you should add the egg yolks to the milk and butter -- THEN add it to the dry mix.  Once the egg whites were FOLDED in the mixture had a different texture which was better.  I think the waffle iron had a lot to do with my flimsy waffles.  Ours is a Belgian type and the waffles never seemed to 'poof'"
471652,280148,2008-05-30,5,"This was a great, quick, weeknight supper  dish that my whole family really enjoyed!  We all love garbanzo beans and Middle Eastern flavors so assumed that we would like this as well.  Usually we eat garbanzos cold so I wasn't sure if everyone would like the hot dish and as my husband is a real carnivore I was worried about the ""vegetarian"" supper but all were completely satisfied and asking for it again!  Did I mention  that it was so easy to toss together!  Thanks Julie for a keeper."
361531,74126,2006-11-01,4,"This is the recipe that I've been using for many years, just didn't have an origin.   I've never come across one that was this good.   I put pecans in mine, and if I'm feeling decadant, I've used cocoa nibs before, but it really changes the bread.  It's fun to experiment though."
59064,31072,2005-02-09,5,"Very nice pizza dough. I replaced the olive oil with the oil from a jar of sundried tomatoes and used 1 1/3 cup rye flour in the 4 cups flour. Yje dough was still very light!
Bake times were spot on."
1179225,7101,2013-02-12,4,"This was a really simple and quick meal to pull together. I added some kale, just for extra nutrition. Thanks for posting the recipe."
2627639,476314,2013-01-11,0,"I must be the first but I absolutely find this chicken to be disgusting.  I can't describe the flavor I tasted but it wasn't mustard and it wasn't syrup.  It was a lingering weird flavor that was hard for me to stomach after my first bite.  This recipe was nothing like I imagined it would be. Surprisingly, my very picky husband who hates mustard did enjoy it.  So maybe its just my tastebuds.  I did learn that I love chicken thighs though.  I have never cooked them before and I found them to be much juicier and more tender than breast meat."
54678,368387,2010-01-26,5,This was awesome - we used a small pork roast and a small moose roast totalling 6 lbs. I have usuallly eaten pulled meats with bbq sauce only but the black pepper vinaigrette was very good and a nice change.
164610,100578,2007-08-19,3,"I thought I reviewed this already, so sorry for the late review. :)  I made this months ago.  Lemon and cinnamon are both flavors I enjoy and I eat a lot of boneless/skinless chicken breasts so when I found this recipe I thought it would make a nice change/variation.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have shallots so I used sweet onions.  I was only cooking for 2, so I had 2 breasts but kept the rest of the ingredients the same amt.  This did make my apartment smell really lovely but the flavor of this dish was so mild as to be a bit boring.  My bf wasn't very impressed, either.  I did atually think the flavors went really well together and the chicken was moist and tender and the sauce was good, just not enough flavor.  Thanks for sharing, Renea', but I prob won't make this again, but I'm going to keep it around just in case.  I wonder how this migh twork if I marinated the chicken first?"
1217095,94013,2010-01-01,5,"I made this on New Year's Day for my DH and son. I also had to use sweet cherries (frozen) and the sauce was excellent. I cut the soy sauce to 1 tablespoon because we don't care for overly salty food and my DH raved about the sauce, eating it with the duck, rice and then alone. My one problem was the house got somewhat smokey the second hour of cooking. I used a pan with a rack for the duck to rest on, so the drippings fell into the pan below the duck. Did anyone else have this problem?"
41682,341847,2009-12-29,5,Great recipe.  I will definitely make this again.
96295,166089,2006-05-08,2,"We thought it tasted gritty and the peanut butter was too dominate...not impressed with this one.
"
286566,106284,2010-06-13,5,"I only made the lamb component of this which was 1.5k did the initial 30 minutes at 250C fan forced and then turned down to 170C fan forced thinking it would be ready in 2 hours, basted every 15 minutes and just over an hour later it was cooked to well done (which is how we like it) and as it was going to be an hour before the recipe #171945 would be ready I turned the lamb down to 100C non fan and did my potatoes in the top oven.  The lamb was lovely and moist though the DH thought it had a slightly crockpot taste but was still good.  We did have an unfortunate incident with the gravy, as the DH was pouring it into the gravyboat the pot (heavy caste iron) slipped and smashed the gravy boat but was able to salvage enough gravy from the pot for the photo and to give everyone a taste.  Thank you Jan, made as a recipenap/pressie for Aussie/Kiwi Swap #41 June 2010."
246482,483458,2012-08-07,5,I used only 1/4 tsp of cayeene and one squirt of Dijon so it was just right for my taste.  Made for World Tour 8
498271,235374,2007-12-15,5,Yum - loved this!  So simple and refreshing!  I garnished with a lime slice since the drink contained lime juice.  I enjoyed this and will definitely be making it often!
286713,148522,2006-01-23,5,Fantastic!  I made this in place of mashed potatoes and it is one of the best veggie dished I have ever tasted and easy!  I plan to make more next time for snacking on during the week.
398275,244933,2012-10-24,4,Great soup!  I cut the recipe in half and subbed the pepper with Mrs. Dash Salt-Free Extra Spicy Seasoning.  Served with bread and a side salad.  Thanks for sharing!  ***Made for Fall PAC 2012***
2064098,90000,2011-11-13,5,"I can not even tell you how good this recipe was.  My BF and I couldn't BELIEVE it tasted this good!  We will DEFINITELY make this again!  I think I'm about to go heat up my leftovers now.  I'm TRYING to save them for breakfast tomorrow, but I'm not sure I can..."
2908494,36386,2014-05-06,5,"Uncle Bill, my husband and I just loved your stuffed peppers! He gives you 10 stars! I can&#039;t post a photo because they are all eaten! Oishii, ne!!!"
30022,41086,2004-02-17,3,"I am really sorry but I tried this recipe and it really didn't taste right to me.  I followed the recipe to the tea and still feel as if it didn't come out right.  I feel that lack of cocoa powder and baking soda caused an effect in the recipe.  It was really thick, very uneasy to spread and not very soft at all.  Again I am not trying to be overly critical,  but this is how my recipe turned out.  I am really sorry once again."
281919,76001,2006-01-19,5,"This is a great recipe!  I love anything with cheese.  I'll make a bunch for the kids and then with what's left, I add 1-2 cloves fresh garlic to the mix for a spicier kick that goes great with the sharp cheddar.  Thank you for your recipe, we love it!!"
1069239,107142,2009-01-19,5,This recipe was loved by all. My boys ate it right up and asked for more.
386585,352997,2013-04-01,5,"I was very happily surprised by this recipe; I was looking for something a little different, and this fit the bill!  I couldn&#039;t find lemon thyme leaves and had to use regular thyme.  My asparagus took longer than 5 minutes to get to the texture that we like, so I added the lemon juice to the skillet and let them &quot;steam&quot; in the lemon juice for an additional few minutes.  The Dijon was not overpowering at all and, with the thyme, added the perfect hint of new flavors.  I will be making this again!  It was a big hit on my Easter table.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for PRMR Tag Game."
163986,136680,2009-01-05,5,This is very good. Tastes like a baked potato should. It is a huge meal. There are only two of us now and we ate four slices between us. Will save the other two slices for tomorrow's supper and have some meat and veggie with it. Will warm it up. I put a little salt on mine and it brought out the flavor. Maybe I'll try it next time with some broccoli on it. Thanks for the recipe. Yummmy!  EDIT:  Forgot the stars.  Don't know how that happened.  Sorry!  It deserves 5-stars.
60504,25348,2008-06-03,5,"Super easy and finger licking good!!! Thanks so much for sharing, this will sure be on my list for any dinners i host."
535715,297863,2008-08-15,4,"I tried this for a baby shower and used it on strawberry cupcakes.  I like the way the frosting held up to storage and displayed very well.  I piped it around and around the tops of the cupcakes.  I added a little strawberry extract to add to the strawberry experience.  I thought they turned out ""berry"" well.  I did not try to smooth the frosting so I cannot comment on that aspect.  Overall, a very nice and easy to use frosting.  Thanks!"
118684,294106,2008-12-09,5,wonderful... made for my cookie exchange. nicely spiced and unique.
130531,208434,2008-09-09,5,"This was a sensational recipe. I have tried many over the years, and always wished for just a little bit more flavor......well this recipe delivered. It was not dry and not too moist.....just right.  I made 1/2 the recipe and it was the perfect size for my small baking pan which is about 8 x 10 inches. 
 I am going to make it again and add some corn and some jalapeno    peppers.    
Now I can throw away that last box of Jiffy mix that I have in the pantry.!! Thanks for posting.....I now have a favorite cornbread !  Donna"
305531,359623,2017-08-17,5,"Delicious peas. I used fresh tarragon from my garden and loved the great flavor it gave to these peas. Thanks for sharing this great side dish, BK. Made for CQ4."
258528,221953,2007-05-10,5,Quick and easy to prepare. Great taste. Will make it again.
169430,80268,2007-02-11,5,"First, I must agree with M'Larky, I dislike recipes that mix metric and U.S. measurements. They are troublesome. Having said that, I made these for a bake sale and they sold out within an hour. I think that rates 5 stars. It's not a difficult recipe. I made these the night before so they would have plenty of time to set up well and they looked great this morning. While I didn't eat any I can tell you that they are finger lickin good!"
428885,282804,2010-06-10,5,"Well you're right, this is a lovely side lunch to be enjoyed in the bright sunshine of the day. Or curled up on the couch taking sometime out, devouring this special couscous! I followed this exactly, loving the shallots, cumin, and small carrot. Lovely! will be making this more often. Made for ZWT6 Zee Zesties!"
242729,13070,2007-02-04,5,"I made these a couple of years ago - way before I became more involved in Zaar forums & before I became a premium member! They were EASY, crisp and tasty! And, they have now all gone.....obviously! When I get hold of some more cucumbers, later in the season, I will make them & photograph them again! Thanks for this recipe Mirj, I still have the printed recipe in my scrapbook!!
P.S. As I recall - I made them exactly as stated and I felt that they were just a bit on the sweet side - but not much!"
174096,29009,2012-02-28,5,"Wonderful version of latkes - loved the fusion twist!  These were very tasty, and the dipping sauce was a nice touch.  Thanks for sharing!  All You Can Eat Buffet Winter '12"
180406,138852,2006-09-29,5,I have made this recipe before for several different groups and it always gets rave reviews.  I had lost the recipe and was glad to see it on the website.  Thanks Leezah.
242766,30008,2005-10-28,5,"This dish is delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly, and served it over a cumin rice.  My family went wild; they loved the flavors.  Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe!!"
220403,140270,2007-11-19,5,"This really was delightful!!  It was easy to make (my kids helped), and it came out perfectly!  Most homemade caramel corn I have tasted is chewy, but after this cooled, it became pefectly crunchy!  This would make a great holiday tradition with the family, perhaps while putting up the tree or on New Year's Eve.  Thank you, Amy."
373020,301162,2009-02-18,4,"Fabulous!!!!!! I doubled it and substituted 6 cups of veggies (carrots, potato, squash, zucchini and celery) for the barley and minced (ground ) chicken for the chicken breasts and kidney beans for the black beans.  Great with a sprinkle of grated cheese on top.  As I am getting over a cold I wanted something different to my ""usual"" soup ans I had everything in my cupboard/fridge.  I cannot recommend this one more! Thanks for the outstanding recipe."
1893644,66256,2011-06-20,5,"Really easy to prepare with really great taste! <br/>I substituted some regular chili powder for chili flakes, then added a pinch of habanero chili powder to give it a little extra kick. Grilled on high heat, 3 minutes per side for 2-inch thick steaks to get them medium rare to rare. <br/>Thanks Rita for the great recipe."
1049912,410205,2010-05-29,5,"This recipe makes a perfect seitan loaf!  I made sandwiches with it, and will try it again with barbecue sauce on the grill."
495947,190470,2010-04-20,5,Excellent snack! I added cumin and some icing sugar for a sweet/salty/sour taste that is addicting! Great recipe!
204628,106800,2005-05-10,0,"Not a review...sorry!  Just wanted to comment to Ami in D-land that I have always been led to believe that you shouldn't add any salt to the water when cooking beans as it makes them tough, you should add it after cooking.  I'm assuming that any broth or stock that you use for cooking would contain salt.
"
612948,69633,2007-10-12,5,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this icing - and so does everyone else I know that tasted it. The almond extract gives it a wonderful flavor. I doubled the meringue powder so it would crust a little more. EXCELLENT icing recipe!"
1609858,315670,2013-01-04,5,"I also own the 2006 Southern Living Annual Recipe Book and found this there.  Made it this week for a ""Salad Supper"" that we did for guests.  Husband really enjoyed it, and he is picky about chicken salad.  I did use full fat mayo, as the book doesn't specify light mayo.  So I'm not sure how that would affect the taste, but I guess that's up to you.  I think if I were going to ""lighten it up"" I would do half full fat mayo and half fat free yogurt or sour cream.  I served this as a choice of mini sandwiches (served on whole wheat dinner rolls) or as is.  We had it alongside of shrimp salad, green salad, raw veggie dippers, a variety of dressing/dips, cornbread muffins, and a nut bowl."
311625,108787,2012-10-19,5,"Really nice and spicy! Next time I'll double the potatoes, but that's the only change. Thanks!"
239758,424929,2010-06-15,5,Great burgers. I simply massaged the filling into the ground beef and then shaped into patties. Wonderful flavours and so easy to make. Thanks for posting.
1277857,149660,2011-01-30,5,"LOVE THIS...tried another frosting last night, and it wasn't even close to being as good as this!!  I'm pretty sure this is going in the family cookbook!!!"
13483,126333,2006-06-28,5,This was excellent and made quite a bit.  Good way to stretch the shrimp.  I used Tequilla as I had no vermouth and kicked up the pepper sauce a lot.  Served over rice it made a terrific outdoor lunch for three hungry guys.  Thanks Oolala
491259,138233,2007-04-28,5,This is also my grandmother's recipe.  The only change that I have made to it is to use butter flavored shortening.  The amount of water does depend on the flour moisture content so it can take from 3 - 5 Tbs of water.
166642,234621,2007-11-24,5,These are very good brownies! My family enjoyed them a lot. I will be making these again since I make brownies frequently. A keeper!
1133279,31521,2009-01-18,2,"Very disappointing.  Flavor was decent, but WAY too much flour for dredging and too many scallops for my large saute pan.  I may try this again with sea scallops and a ton of my own changes!"
321999,16842,2007-09-23,5,"This is the most amazing marinade recipe.  It makes a lot though, which also makes it perfect for OAMC and freezing with meat.  I ended up spliting it into thirds.  In one bag was two boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and two bags had 2 boneless pork chops each (I could have easily quartered this though since I only had a small amount of meat in each bag).  I then froze all three.
I did leave out the meat tenderizer, simply because I didn't have any.  I also used 1 t each of garlic salt and onion powder (again all I had).
I cooked the chicken for dinner tonight and it was amazing.  I took the meat out this morning to thaw in the marinade (thawed in the fridge).  My husband remarked on how nicely the meat was coated when he grilled it.
The meat is perfectly sweet, not hurt your teeth, dessert sweet, but a nice sweetness with a hint of tange, almost like a really good barbeque sauce.  
The only warning I would give is because of the high sugar content from the dressing, ketchup and sugar itself watch the meat closly when you grill to prevent burning."
147175,22114,2005-08-07,5,"Thank you Ken! My husband just went deep sea fishing and brought back 20lbs of Halibut. I followed the direction expect, set the oven at 450 instead or 500 and cooked it for 20min (think 15min would have been perfect). The flavor was very good, next time (and there will be a next time) I'm gonna try to add some heat to it (crushed red peppers). Thanx again."
448342,420561,2010-04-17,0,"Not going to rate it; have not tried this particular recipe.  When I saw this, it brought back fond memories of when we would visit my Hoosier relatives (Ft. Wayne, Columbia City).  There was a restaurant that served a similar recipe (minus the cayenne pepper).  They are so good!  Thanks for the memories."
531256,123503,2017-05-25,3,I made this pretty much as directed using cream of mushroom instead of chicken and not using the optional mushrooms. It tasted like hot sour cream and was way too thick. I added about 2 tsp of beef granules and about 1/2 a cup of milk and it was better.
953275,338839,2009-08-15,4,"This is pretty good - it certainly is a quick way to throw broccoli together for a side dish - and much more flavour than steaming.  My kids did really  like it.  I wasn't a huge fan, it was still quite underdone after 20 mins, but the garlic was starting to burn a little so I took it out.  If you like your broccoli cooked crisp then this would be ideal for you.  Thanks blucoat!"
822681,41246,2008-07-30,5,"This recipe rocks!!! The only variation I have ever made is to use salsa instead of picante (because I never have it on hand.) This recipe is easy, inexpensive and best of all, my 3 and 6 year olds actually get excited when they know I'm making it...they say it's their favorite meal!"
424680,207854,2008-08-12,5,"Made this GREAT FROZEN DESSERT as directed (although I was tempted to use half papaya & half mango) & it is a wonderful, cool treat at the end of a hot day! Thanks for sharing! [Tagged, made & reviewed for one of my adopted Joeys in the Aus/NZ Special Recipe Swap #19]"
9590,23555,2004-04-15,5,AWESOME COOKIES!  :)  I cut the recipe by third (because I only had that much butter and I desparately wanted to try these) and they came out perfect.  Will make these again!
437727,105417,2008-10-01,5,"Mmmmmm...!!!! I just started two bottles of this, and I just KNOW it will be fantastic! I got vanilla beans from ""www.organic-vanilla.com"" (The Organic Vanilla Bean Co)... if you're wanting to make some extract, I suggest this website to purchase beans...MUCH better than store-bought! Thanks, Mirj! (and thank Ruth for me, too!) : )"
133174,298434,2009-05-18,4,This was made using a 12.5 oz can of white meat chicken.  It was served on top of mixed greens.  The curry powder was doubled.  I think that the addition of walnuts or pecans along with some dried cranberries would be excellent additions.  Made for *ZWT 5*
868551,163672,2012-04-15,5,"Made this cake for my husbands birthday with chocolate and strawberry ice cream. For the filling i used the fudge, but instead of the cookies i mixed the fudge with toffee bits and i frosted the cake with whip cream frosting. everyone loved it!"
169430,194336,2006-11-18,4,Made this for dinner tonight. It was very good and I like the fact that there is no sweetening ask for. I used jasmine rice and it made a lovely dish. I made a full batch and have tons leftover (YAY). This rice would be good with almost anything as it's not sweet but once you start you just want to keep eating it! Thanks Jeri.
8688,367949,2011-03-06,5,"Fabulous Coffeecake!  Tender, moist cake with loads for filling and topping.  In the middle of my recipe on an early Sunday morning, I discovered the sour cream I was planning to use was a few weeks out of date.  So, I subbed buttermilk which worked beautifully!!  I highly recommend this coffeecake!  It is delicious!!  Thanks, doj!"
291188,100480,2014-05-25,5,Used cook and serve Butterscotch for the Carmel flavor as many reviews wanted to try. My apples I sliced and froze in apple pie spices/sugar so they were already yummy but wanted to try adding the box of dry pudding mix to see what happened. Plus several reviews suggested adding cinnamon so I thought with all that sugar it has to be good! One friend who doesn&#039;t like pie even liked it. I will keep as a recipe to switch things up.
394006,5170,2007-02-22,5,"This is the first recipe I've tried for pancakes and all I can say is that I doubt I'll ever use another.  They turned out perfectly.  We had them for dessert on Shrove Tuesday instead of having crepes, like my mum always used to make.  They are light and fluffy and taste great with syrup and vanilla ice cream.  My partner had them with lemon marmalade. We had some left over in the morning which I popped in the microwave, for about 20 seconds on each side, and they still tasted delicious with syrup and a little butter.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Bill (and Pete!)"
53959,120383,2005-12-25,5,This is one of our favorite dips. I usually add guacamole tho and pass on the onions. This is just our preference. Will definatly make again.
37449,242927,2007-08-20,5,"Delicious! I used the heavy cream , and for the milk used skim. I didn't have vanilla beans so used 1 tsp. vanilla. Thank you for  yummy dessert!"
383346,204915,2007-06-18,5,"I did twice the recipe for 3 people and served it in sangria glasses.  That was perfect.  It's not too sweet, perfect.  Everybody liked it.  Made for ZWT 3"
593702,52253,2007-09-29,5,"OMG this was DELICIOUS!!!!  My boyfriend loved this so much, he had me make it twice in one week! I also made only half of the dumplings... there were plenty! The first time I made it, it was a HUGE mess... but so well worth it! The second time was easier! Thank you!"
793359,110806,2015-02-11,5,Made this using extra un-used veggies from my fridge. I also didn&#039;t have fresh basil so I used dried. It was one of the best dishes ever and a great way to clean out my fridge and not have to throw out small amounts of un-used veggies.
464080,310997,2008-09-02,5,"LOVED it.  After I had the bananas and blueberries in the blender I realized that my ""bottle of OJ"" was actually a ""bottle of Peach, Papaya, Mango juice"".  It substituted out for the OJ beautifully.  And instead of the water, I subbed out ice to make it frosty.  Even my 2 yr old son who NEVER touches a smoothie is drinking it up.  THANKS!  Made for Aus/NZ Recipe Swap #20."
1156458,167914,2012-04-27,5,"Wonderful! If Kittencalkitchen has a recipe for what your looking for always go for it! These are the best pancakes I've ever had, anywhere! I made them exactly as written and I did include the vanilla. These were thick but they were so fluffy that it made for the perfect combination."
989281,116882,2010-04-09,5,"This recipe deserves every one of those stars!  The sauce is SO delicious and flavorful, make sure to make extra as you'll be licking your plate clean :)"
167527,295796,2009-05-06,5,"This is an excellent recipe for cooking sea bass.  I used the cilantro lime butter with the addition of garlic just because I eat garlic in everything I make.  I also wrapped the fish in banana leaves instead of corn husks which was very flavorful.

Thank you!"
95796,65040,2003-07-25,5,Beautiful.This is the first recipe that I have tried and if this is anything to go by I can't wait to try more. Well done!
881884,313442,2008-07-20,5,loooove it!
141898,185445,2011-10-29,4,"I would love to give it 4 1/2 stars. They were really good! And one person who ate them swore they were the best cookies he had ever eaten! I really liked them and will defiantly make them again- I just can't say they are my favorite.<br/>I made two batches- the first batch was the recipe followed to a tee- except for the glaze. I omitted the butter, added pumpkin pie spice and eyeballed it because I only wanted to drizzle it across the cookie. I must say, the cookies with more of the glaze were much better IMO- so next I will follow the glaze recipe. Anyway, this batch baked up really fluffy and cakelike. I smoshed some of the before I put them in the oven so they would bake more like cookies and less like muffin tops!<br/>The second batch was made the next day with the remaining pumpkin (waste not, want not!)- which did not measure to one cup (I didn't even bother measuring it- but I would guess 1/2 cup). The batter was a good consistency, so I didn't think I needed to add any extra liquid to make up for the pumpkin. But I did mix in about a cup of chocolate chips to make up for less pumpkin flavor (if I had pumpkin flavoring I might have added that- yes they make it, King Arthur Flour.com carries it). These baked up much more like traditional cookies and less like muffin tops. I didn't glaze these.<br/>I had some family members who preferred the original posted recipe and some who preferred it with chocolate chips! So I will make both again- it was a great way to use up the rest of the pumpkin."
68884,126505,2008-01-24,4,"Sooooo quick & tasty!! I cut back on the amount of onion & bacon just a bit, probably added 2 more Tbsp of parmesan. This has a lot of flavor to have so few ingredients. A great change from my usual crazy-weeknight meal of doctoring some jarred pasta sauce ;)"
1802763950,26849,2014-05-24,0,Not good. They were thick and cake-like. Took about 15-17minutes to bake. Not 10-12. Weren&#039;t sweet enough either. Won&#039;t make these again.
35526,320408,2008-08-21,5,"This was a great Sunday dinner a few weeks ago for the boyfriend.  He enjoys comfort food and this certainly filled the bill.  I used low fat/low sodium cream of mushroom and no fat sour cream with great results.  Twas a tad salty but that was probably my heavy hand when I seasoned the chops.  Good tummy filler, goes well with a green salad."
160541,95702,2004-08-30,4,"My boyfriend liked this recipe a lot.  It was a bit too mushroomy for me as a main dish, but would make a great side dish (or a main dish for mushroom lovers).  I substituted 1/4 soy milk & 1/4 silken tofu for the cream.  Also, I'm fairly certain the porcini measurement is wrong -- 7 grams is about .002 lbs, which is not very much at all.  I ended up using about .08 lbs of dried porcinis.  "
814986,370299,2010-04-19,4,"Goooood flavor, like the previous reviewer said.  I added in some chopped black olives, an extra half-onion to use it up, and salsa instead of the canned tomatoes.  This is the kind of recipe that you can just play with, adding whatever veggies you have on hand.  

Because of the previous reviewer, who had problems with an overly moist mix, I wound up leaving the lid off my slow cooker after shredding my chicken to let some of the moisture evaporate.  I let the mix sit for maybe 30 min while I made the rest of the meal, and it was sufficiently dry for us.  I'm giving the recipe 4 stars because the taste warrants a 5 but I needed to alter the technique (and watch it closely!) toward the end."
42222243,133563,2015-01-14,1,"Tasted like watered down bland hummus. I tried adding tons more fresh rosemary, and attempting to doctor it up with some other things, but I couldn&#039;t save it. Even my very non-picky husband (will eat just about anything) didn&#039;t like it. Put it in the fridge hoping maybe it would be better the next day, but it was worse. We ended up throwing it in the trash."
37779,19375,2003-11-05,5,"My husband and I helped move my niece into our garage apartment. Thought it was appropriate to try this dish. We loved it. Very hearty, filling, well-seasoned, and comforting. Loved the flavor of the red wine. I served it over noodles. A great comfort food. Thanks Secret."
339260,252121,2007-09-23,5,"In the words of Rachael Ray, this dish is YUMMO!  Whips together so easily and quickly and tastes great.  I don't have breakfast very often during the week, but I do enjoy breakfast on the weekends or for dinner.  I will be making this often in the future.  Thanks for sharing such a scrumptious recipe, Coffeebarista."
1611346,73166,2010-05-07,0,This is WONDERFUL!  I changed the ground beef to ground turkey and left out the cubed beef sirloin.  I served it to a large group of big-time red meat eaters and NOONE knew the difference!!!  I left the chilis on the side and used chili powder instead of sauce and everybody had seconds and asked for the recipee!  Thanks!
481092,377920,2009-08-12,5,"This was unique to say the least.  At first bite I wasn't quite sure what to think.  Squeezed some lemon on top, which I think is just what was needed to make a cohesive entree.  To make something using panko that is not meant to be crunchy was a unique concept, but it worked.  I used Siracha sauce instead of chili paste.  Only complaint is that it is quite salty, but that is to be expected with the ingredients.  Interesting."
481092,316277,2010-05-26,5,"The office devoured this, so it must be good!  I halved the recipe and cooked in an 8X8 with great results.  I used green onions as the additional ingredient.  For ZWT."
2001362355,166696,2018-07-01,5,"Easy, tastes good and looks good. I put in an extra large graham cracker crust."
166642,224795,2008-03-05,5,This makes a very good breakfast smoothie. It's very refreshing and easy to make. I love that it has ingredients that I usually always have on hand. I have made this several times since tagging it in Holiday tag. Delicious!
479241,82102,2012-10-09,5,Fantastic!
2001378504,5170,2017-02-04,5,"I made these this morning. The pancakes were big, but very light. My husband and I enjoyed them. I have shared this with a friend as well. This is the best pancake recipe ever!!!!"
182358,86644,2005-07-31,5,"Tasty, easy to make, and the perfect size for kids!  I followed the recipe exactly, using shredded cheddar.  My grandsons loved unrolling them and eating strips of curling bread and ham...  and my DIL enjoyed them also.  Even 15 mo old grandson enjoyed them!     Would make a quick appetizer for grown ups too! "
534554,303295,2009-01-01,5,"This was a great alternative pizza to pizza with tomato sauce.  I love garlic and the tang of the ranch was great!  I wasn't crazy about the basil flavor, so next time I will just stick to the mushroom, green onion and olive toppings that looked so good in the picture!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
165623,37064,2007-07-11,4,The only change I made was instead of oats and almonds I used a granola that I love. This is a low sweet parfait but still tastes great. I will make this again ... Thanks Derf.
201581,453488,2011-10-28,5,"I halved the recipe using a Jiffy cake mix, 1 egg, and 1 egg white,and not knowing how to split the pudding I used a 4 serving package and it came out heavenly! Thanks for posting brandi. Made for Fall PAC 2011."
421520,26849,2013-04-30,0,"Everyone loved these!  I had to change it up a bit to make them Gluten Free, but they were wonderful and I posted the GF recipe on my blog (http://www.glutenfreebakingbear.com) with a link to your original recipe.  My friend who&#039;s favorite cookies are Chocolate Chip said they were indeed the best ones ever. They were tender and the texture was a perfect balance between soft and crisp. Thank you for a great recipe."
129372,125662,2009-06-01,5,Very good. I used Real Lime powder since that's what I had in the house and they turned out wonderful! Everyone in the house loved them and I sent the recipe to a few friends.
714468,155375,2010-01-20,4,I really liked this soup.  I make soup once a week and this was a nice change of pace.  My liquid portion turned out really thick and I had to add a bit more chicken broth to thin it out.  I also used the steam in the bag broccoli and it worked great.
166371,110640,2007-08-22,4,Really liked these!  They were very tasty and easy to make after a long day at work.  We topped ours just like the recipe says with mustard and dill pickle coins with an added cheese slice and ate them in the bun on a plate with a fork...sort of tough to pick up and eat...maybe better in a hot dog bun.  Really yummy!
67899,46834,2003-09-23,5,"These are delicious! They're so moist and puffy. I was a little sceptical abour how ""cake like"" they would be, since the batter was so hard, but when I added the peaches it softened right up. Thanks for a great recipe!"
59686,219256,2010-04-22,5,"I made these for lunch today, but
 used my own Italian meatballs that I had made and that were stored in my freezer. Of course I unthawed them before placing them in a skillet. As for the sauce,
 I used Welch's Concord Grape Jam rather than the grape jelly. I didn't use all the sauce, just enough to cover the 1 pound of meatballs in the skillet, and I simmered the meatballs for 10 minutes, then placed them and the sauce in a casserole baking dish, covered them, and baked them in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes. Both my husband and I enjoyed the meatballs, and Abby I'd like to thank you for the recipe."
1248720,280087,2013-11-10,5,Really liked the substitution of the greek yogurt instead of the sour cream.  Will definitely try again.  Of course omitted a few salad ingredients to suit my family&#039;s tastes.  Thanks for the recipe.
865936,457132,2012-07-29,4,"What a nice alternative for those who do not like or cannot have seafood!  The only caution is, this is not something that can be made too far ahead of time, the texture suffers."
271772,141026,2006-10-01,5,"Tried this and loved it - every last drop was eaten. If there are children at the meal they might like it using 1/2 beef stock, 1/2 wine. Getting the marinade together takes a little time but it is well worth it."
431813,414831,2010-03-29,4,"This was a nice lemon loaf, but it wasn't as lemony as we would have liked.  Next time I think I'd add some juice into the loaf in addition to the fresh juice squeezed on top.  Really quick and easy though.  Thanks for posting!  Made for PAC Spring 2010."
204024,478788,2013-04-17,4,This made an easy and good dinner for the 4 of us.  Made for PAC Spring 2013.
4601,350894,2009-02-08,5,"This was really easy to make, and absolutely delicious!  Consistency was perfect.  Thank you for a great recipe!"
222696,8979,2005-10-31,4,"This was a pretty good sauce. However, the (rice) vinegar flavor is still a bit too strong for my tastes. 
I pureed the tomatoes, chili peppers, and scallions before cooking, and then simmered for an hour. Thanks for the recipe!"
281306,139582,2010-10-20,0,"I won't give a rating since I only used this recipe for the icing. This tasted really amazing. However, not sure if I did something wrong or if more/different instruction is needed. All was going well until I started adding water. Then the butter started separating and it wouldn't combine properly again until partly solidified in the fridge. Maybe milk would have been better, with its fat base? Or maybe the water needs to be added slowly in droplets?"
1802459485,119158,2014-02-06,0,"I didn&#039;t belileve the reviews that this is better than beef steaks, but I tried it. And glory be, this is true! My husband never comments on food no matter how great it is, but this he loved! It was every bit as tender as filet mignon without exaggeration and extremely tasty!!! I&#039;ve made it several times now and it really is the best. The first time the BBQ got covered in a snow storm so I cooked it in a pan with Olive Oil and Butter. Really good!"
1505821,402828,2010-01-01,5,best cookies ever bar none
140107,6813,2005-06-26,5,I used five eggs and less salt but more pepper. you have hit a homerun with this.
791177,89063,2009-10-08,0,We call theese congo bars.
67656,209445,2007-08-15,3,"Just switched to the Flex plan and in search of simple recipes that fit within my points range.  I made one small substitution, replacing the flaked onions for 2 tablespoons of diced onion and otherwise made as presented. I turned my chicken over before adding the mushrooms so that the broth would fully permeate the chicken breasts. With the juices of chicken the soy and honey, the chicken and mushrooms poach in the oven. I enjoyed the combination of soy and honey and thought it worked well with the other components in the dish. (Like Cookin' Jo I used low sodium soy and thing regular would have been overpowering.)  These flavors might have been enhanced with the addition of a wee bit more pepper or perhaps some ginger."
227978,400992,2013-01-08,4,"This was quite refreshing.  Next time, I will keep the brown sugar at the 2 Tbsp, but I will omit the soda water (because I think the ice cubes were enough for consistency and the soda seemed to water it all down a little too much).  And I will double the amount of Frangelica, only because I think it really made this refreshing iced coffee drink so flavorful.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, SoupCookie."
1802849661,36023,2016-01-18,5,"Can&#039;t believe this was my first time trying Country Fried Steak, but boy was it worth the wait! This is delicious and so easy to make!"
291188,55754,2010-04-09,4,"had a lot of buttermilk to use up, thanks for the simple recipe. I added extra spices based off other reviews saying a little bland. Served w/ rice. Thanks"
162013,47195,2004-11-20,0,"YUMMMM I read this (11:30 at night lol) and ran off to make a snack, it is delicious!  so tasty easy and crispy.  I used a light spray of olive oil and had to add a little extra time since I have the same problem .. an oold microwave... so tasty and delicious."
32058,55664,2003-04-10,2,Made this for dinner and was disappointed.  I had to add several things to it just to make it edible.  
198154,471342,2014-09-15,4,"DD and friends are big Harry Potter fans. So we HAD to make these cupcakes. The cake has more of a muffin texture. I wish they were a little lighter.  The ganache helps, but can make them mushy if you make them ahead of time.  While they were good, they were a little time consuming for the end result.  Not against making them again, but we will tweak and continue looking for those perfect Potter cupcakes!"
1598244,306507,2010-12-13,5,"Amazing!  I always make a double recipe, and add extra lime juice and red pepper.  I get requests to bring this to every family cook-out."
29300,17507,2002-04-28,4,"The taste of this bread is wonderful but I only gave it 4 stars because I did have a little bit of a problem with the recipe. I think that 3 cups of flour is a little bit too much and I had to end up adding a little more water and wasnt sure what the results were going to be. It made a loaf of bread so big that I thought that it was going to rise right out of the bread machine but it didnt. You also could not taste the feta cheese in the bread. The next time that I make this I will use less flour and more cheese. Other than that, it was a great recipe and the bread was very moist and delicious. Thank you for posting this recipe."
213909,78579,2007-11-10,5,This deserves a GAZILLION STARS! It is the best stuff since sliced bread!1 LOL. Baked good practically fly out of the pan! Thanks for sharing! Ingrid/Koechin
1405372,276268,2010-12-11,5,"I had been craving this Chipotle Mayo Dip I had at a restarant called Hell's Kitchen while visiting Minneapolis. I just buy the Sweet Potato Fries at Costo-- and use this dip! It tastes very close to Hell's Kitchens dip! I love it--<br/>I used Chipotle Sauce (found at Kroger stores), Cumin, Mayo and added 1 Tbsp. chopped cilantro! So yummy ! Thanks!"
125853,196548,2009-01-24,5,Really GOOD!  I used 1/2 & 1/2 in place of the cream with excellent results.  I also used more basil and a mix of canned diced and fresh diced tomatoes.
166642,131169,2009-09-30,5,My family enjoyed these parmesan chicken fingers immensely. The amount of seasonings is just perfect and they bake beautifully. Very moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. Thanks so much!
540346,225347,2015-03-16,5,"So good and refreshing; complemented a meal of enchiladas, rice, and bean very well.  I made as directed except that I only used 6 oz of tequila and that was plenty!  I cannot imagine what it would be like with 12 oz."
245915,256909,2008-01-02,5,Very nice biscuit by itself w/ butter or as a topper for a broccoli casserole...super easy way to use up extra potatoes~ Thanks for posting
131126,489004,2012-11-04,5,"I was intrigued by the ""no stirring"" instructions when I found the recipe so wanted to try it.  It worked! :-)   I admit to omitting the mint out of personal preference, but we enjoyed the tart lemony flavor of this.  Served with Recipe #90662 for Fall 2012 Pick A Chef."
332878,202704,2007-02-07,4,"This was quite tasty.  About the only problem I would forsee is that the portion sizes are relatively small.  My husband and I aren't huge eaters, so it wasn't a problem for us.  Usually we end up getting half again the servings out of a recipe when we prepare it.  This one was just enough for the two of us.  (granted, we were dumb and forgot to start the rice cooking early enough to have it with dinner, so we grabbed some bread to sop up the sauce with.)  I might make this again with some hot sauce or cayenne added for a little kick.  Overall it was very tasty though :)"
167242,87634,2007-04-21,5,"For recipes like this, they should let you put more stars!  This liqueur is the perfect balance of lemon tanginess, sweet, and creaminess.  Wonderful!  The only problem is that it's easy to drink too much!  We have two bottles waiting in the freezer, calling our name just a little too loudly!  Easy to make, inexpensive, delicious.  Would make a great christmas gift, too!"
88378,100103,2011-04-27,5,"Love the old Minute Rice recipes!  (My mother in law makes Country Pie -- another Minute Rice classic).  This Spanish Rice Pronto was great.  Easy, flavorful, filling.  What more could I want?  I couldn't resist adding a pinch of crushed red peppers to the mix.  I served this with roasted pine nuts-and-cauliflower, corn and crusty bread.  My husband had just come in from a mountain bike ride and started scarfing this down.  Truly enjoyable!  Thanks for posting this."
33159,104673,2004-12-06,5,"These look so unique sitting on a tray & they taste great, too!!  I used regular kisses & peanut M&M's.  My only suggestion - let them sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes before serving.  I liked the texture & taste better that way."
199848,348538,2009-09-21,5,"This combination works extremely well together.  It's quite easy to prepare, too.  I made no changes except to use butter for the margarine.  Thanx for a nice new veggie dish!"
28729,117028,2006-06-12,5,"Great quick tasty salad dressing for dinner. I sub'd ground cumin(is all we had)and onion for shallots(close?)
It was awesome with the potato omelet we had. Thanks for a quick and tasty dressing. Will definately make again."
1802849661,432677,2016-03-16,5,"These were so easy and delicious! I wouldn&#039;t have thought to use a mix with bananas, but it really worked and that strawberry topping is divine!"
542928,382102,2010-01-31,5,"I am so excited to have found this recipe again! I lost it right after I made them this summer. Thsese bars are DELICIOUS! They are pretty much exactly like the starbucks blueberry oatmeal bars. All my friends and family love them. I made up a bunch and put in the freezer this last summer and they really freeze well. Will become a life long family recipe for us. LOVE THEM!  Oh, I used whole wheat pastry flour...not problems with them being crumbly or falling apart."
95233,17113,2004-07-26,5,These chocolate chip cookies were very addicting. Soft and chewy-unlike some cookie recipes. Don't overbake or you want get the best results. Even if they are overbaked their still wonderful.

21752,192262,2007-01-21,5,"This was simply divine, a soup with Nirvana-like proportions.  I made a few changes, adding more sweet potatoes than called for, using full-fat coconut milk, and then pureeing the whole thing with my immersion blender (known as zhuzhing the soup in our house).  It was part of an all-Indian Friday night dinner and was a major hit, even the kids asked for seconds.  There was just enough left over for two large mugs which Sushiman and I enjoyed on Saturday night.  Thanks, this was fantastic!"
1266501,190918,2009-11-09,5,We family really likes these muffins.  My husband with raisins and pecans and my kiddos plain!
368277,184725,2009-08-12,3,"I really wanted to like this because it looked like such a wonderful blend of flavors, and it was good but I just don't think we'll have this one again. I may have had a few too many shakes of tumeric, and that may have had something to do with it. I just did a few shakes of cinnamon like someone suggested, and that seemed to help. I did also thicken it up at the end. Someone thought it was too sweet, but I really didn't think that. My one son did eat more than I thought he would. I am also not one to add salt to things, but this could have used a little more salt. We at ours over rice."
677954,46877,2007-12-06,5,"Truly melt-in-your-mouth!  This an easy one to make with the kids, and I can give them the ""beaters"" to lick since there are no raw eggs.  We used raspberry preserves on one batch & Christmas sprinkles on another.  Thanks, Uncle Bill!"
289860,192083,2006-10-31,4,"Ozzygirl, I was in the mood for a risotto dish when you posted this recipe.  I am a veteran risotto maker so I know how labor-intensive making it can be, but the results are ALWAYS worth it.  And your delish recipe was no exception. I received serious props for it last nite and am happy to say there is enough for a second go-round today!  Thanks for sharing this one, Ozzygirl!"
297301,55977,2008-11-22,5,"Wonderful, quick, and easy!  This was a hit with all 3 of my children and my husband.  I will make it again.  I will use an entire 9oz. bag of spinach next time though.  I used dried herbs (1/2 the amt. recommended for fresh), and I used half and half instead of the milk.  Delish!"
341344,255164,2008-10-13,5,"Just the right amount of citrusy goodness - any more and it might have been too much.  The raisins lend just the right amount of sweetness.  GREAT twist on oat bran.

Thanks!"
452355,373232,2009-05-31,4,"This recipe was easy to prepare and came together quickly.  DH and I were impressed by how complimentary the pairing of the grilled lobster and grilled veal were.  We would have never thought of the combination.  While we liked the dish, we were not overly fond of the frutiness of the sauce, which I believe is probably personal preference.  Our only modifications were to use regular butter in place of clarified, and while I bought watercress, I forgot to garnish the dish with it.  We used Bacardi for the rum.  Thanks for an interesting meal.  Made for ZWT5."
318106,102901,2006-10-11,5,This meal was very good and surprisingly filling!  I made rice on the side which I added to the meal so 1/2 of a pepper was plenty for a serving.  I love how it's so healthy and I can't wait to make it again!
11461,201921,2007-02-28,5,"I usually  follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it, but I didn't this time.  I didn't have any canned peaches, so I used canned pears in light syrup.  I doubled the amount of pecans and cinnamon in the topping because it seemed like it wouldn't be enough.  And it was terrific!!  I'll try it with peaches some other time, but I think doubling the cinnamon and pecans is a great idea.  This made a very nice breakfast for DH and me on a snowy morning!  Thanks, Hill Family!!!"
2002091651,323255,2018-04-02,5,"I found this recipe in Southern Living in 1979 or1980. I made it often at that time and it was a favorite. I recently looked for the recipe, but had misplaced it. I am so glad to find it through you. Little Bits are wonderful and always a big hit! I highly recommend!"
2001617036,205890,2017-07-07,3,"I found them to be too sweet and difficult to bake into a solid cookie, so I changed it a bit. I used coconut oil instead of butter and put the dough in the fridge for awhile. Have you tried that peanut butter with coconut? It's delicious. If you don't care for the taste, you could use refined oil, or half virgin half refined. I rolled the dough in almond meal instead of sugar. For me, this made a better cookie."
1003492,155959,2011-03-12,5,"AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly, marinated it over night, and watched everyone lick their plates. I will making this for the rest of my life! Thanks a ton!"
135665,39087,2010-02-20,5,I don't know what more I can add to the reviews of this recipe except to say WOW this is AMAZING and soooo easy!  I wanted something I could put in the crockpot since I was going out for the day...followed the directions  except doubled everything and then immediately dumped everything in the crockpot on low.  Let is simmer there for 4 hours and served it over bow tie pasta.  Everyone loved it!  Definitely a keeper for us.

35918,43115,2006-10-27,5,"Not that you need any more ratings but this was just wonderful, thank you so much for sharing.  I did put a little extra cinnamon and added vanilla but it was exceptional will definitely be making this again.....Anne"
1218405,66409,2010-08-29,5,So simple to make. I followed the recipe exactly and they came out quite good. Next time I may add either raisins or craisins. I did use the 1/3 cup sugar and added some sugar on the top before baking.
537937,303643,2008-05-26,5,"This was such a great recipe Brooke.  Loved it.  I used a big RedDelicious apple.  And for the granola, I used my favorite recipe of Redsie's. recipe#272650.

2054282,14499,2012-12-29,5,"Simple, foolproof recipe; Delicious & impressive product. I hesitated at first, as I do not like to use packaged mixes. But it was morning of Xmas eve, and I had little time or margin for error. The cake was so well-received that I made a second within four days. Adults AND children enjoyed. Instructions perfect. Slight notations: (a) I could not find a 520 gm cake mix; I used the (seemingly standard) 468 gm box. (b) I used ""french vanilla"" flavor instant pudding. (c) For the glaze, I omitted the water and added that much extra rum. (d) For those concerned about alcohol content, add all rum to glaze mixture up-front and bring to boil & simmer until alcohol has cooked off; for those who wish to retain a bit of the zip of alcohol (my preference), add one cup of rum up-front to make the glaze, and add the last 1/4 cup at the end. (e) I left the cake in the pan for hours - drizzling rum glaze periodically over the top (which I had poked all over w/ toothpicks), and waiting for it to be absorbed and repeating. I reserved a few tablespoons until the end which I drizzled over the turned-out cake. YUM!"
1224926,50772,2009-05-19,5,"Great idea! I ended up using fresh pizza dough from the Publix bakery. As one reviewer suggested, I spread olive oil on the dough and rubbed fresh garlic, italian seasoning and fresh parsley over it. I then topped with chopped onions, fresh mushrooms, sandwich style pepperoni and italian blend shredded cheese. I sprayed my pan with Pam and brushed the visible dough areas with more olive oil. Baked for about 25 min. 
I didn't use any red sauce when I ate one out of the oven and it was great! I like both white pizza and red pizza, but will definitely make the sauce next time to see the difference. Thanks for posting!"
136997,439094,2010-10-21,5,"Surprisingly enough, I've never had spinach soup. This is wonderful. I did add a bit more nutmeg, as I couldn't taste it at an 1/8 tsp. Keeper for sure. Made for Everyday Holiday Tag. :)"
130663,190496,2008-07-02,5,So refreshing
157167,81734,2011-01-24,5,This was really good.  I left off the almonds and served it over greek yogurt.  So rich but so healthy.
869184,456939,2011-06-19,5,My daughters and I made this for 'breakfast-in-bed' Father's Day and it was a big hit. I did not have shallots and used a small clove of garlic instead. I added chives with the parsley as well. Made for ZWT 7 - Food.Commandoes
37305,35090,2005-05-10,5,"This was really good.  My teenage daughter made it for us for Mother's Day and it was an easy dish for her to make.  She used large shell macaroni and left out the green peppers, but other than that she prepared it as written.  Thanks for the easy recipe... leftovers heat well, too!"
47559,108259,2007-08-19,5,"Great soup!  I made this for a casual Saturday dinner for four and served it with fresh bread.  All gave it a solid five stars.  It's hearty with lots of flavor.  I'm adding it to my favorite soups cookbook.  Thanks, Michelle!"

The shortbread cookies were very time-consuming to roll out, and frequently very frustrating. This recipe is great!  I can get the look of the spritz with the melt-in-your-mouth taste of the shortbread all in one...and without the frustration. I will never make both recipes again. Thank you!"
328931,116251,2006-09-02,5,"we liked this, added chilli flakes and gresh ginger garlic. very moist and tasty"
719822,65641,2010-07-25,5,"Awesome recipe, as usual!  I made this sauce for the second time - it's great for the slow cooker!  I quadrupled the recipe, cooking the onions, garlic, Italian seasoning, oregano, salt, pepper, and sugar on the stove.  I cooked everything in a 6 qt slow cooker on high for about 5 hours.  One thing that I didn't like as much the first time I made it (also in the slow cooker) was that it was just a little runny.  This time, to thicken it up, I blended it up with my stick blender and it's perfect.  It freezes well and also tastes great on pasta.  You can't go wrong with this recipe - you'll never want to bring home store-bought again!"
169969,123854,2006-01-02,5,So far this is the best stew I have made from Zaar! Wonderful flavors and quite beautiful. Very easy recipe that is packed with flavors that really meld well together. I recommend this stew to everyone looking for a nice hearty stew with perfect flavors. Thanks Toni!
1298897,200408,2009-06-17,5,OMG!  I am so happy.  I was about to make my normal shrimp scampi when my DH said just look for that recipe you love from bubba gumps online!  I knew I married that man for a reason.  This is one of my all time favorite ways to have shrimp.  It is yummy!
126440,46922,2011-01-09,5,Wonderful ham.  It was easy and had wonderful flavor.  DH loved it.  Served with Sweet Potato Souffle.
339260,283287,2008-02-26,5,"Made for Feb. 2008 Bevy Tag.  Super easy and delicious cheese sauce.  I made this sauce and used it in my tuna noodle casserole.  It really added to the taste of the casserole.  I was out of cream of chicken soup so I used cream of mushroom soup instead.  Other than that, I followed the recipe ingredients and instructions.  It was very easy to whip together.  I will definitely be using this in my tuna noodle casserole from now on.  I can't wait to try this on vegetables.  Thanks for another great recipe, Mandy."
226863,424967,2010-06-22,5,"Loved it!  I love tarragon, and this was a real winner for me.  Served over angel hair pasta.  The kids didn't care for it, but all the grown-ups loved it!  Thanks for sharing a delicious recipe."
690623,202181,2012-08-24,5,Great roasted potatoes - and I consider myself a connoisseur of roasted potatoes!  lol<br/>I didn't have and white wine or beer in the house and figured that red wine would not make for an attractive end result.  I ran next door and cadged a bottle of beer.  I was skeptical about using it as I really don't like beer at all but the results were wonderful.  My potatoes were a little gnarly looking so I peeled and quartered them and also removed the lid for the last 20 minutes.  I love the crunchy bits.  Thanks for posting 'Chelle.  Made for the Bistro Babes - ZWT 8
2001377056,155430,2018-07-29,0,"How is this different than making a simple loaf of white bread using unbleached flour? Except for the olive oil, I don't see any difference. Covering the bowl with a cloth while it sits on the counter to rise will save energy by not turning on the oven when nothing is baking for 1-1/2 hours. Perhaps I'm missing something here."
408826,185543,2006-12-25,5,"I've made this twice now. We liked it so much the first time, I actually made it tonight for Christmas dinner! We added potatoes and baby corns and they went well with the other veggies. We also used canned tomatoes, and it was fine. Very delicious recipe, and very easy the 2nd time around! :)"
508275,283551,2009-03-31,4,"very interesting recipe. My husband and I thought it had too much gluten in it, so next time I'll try less. I ran out of olive oil, so I ended up only being able to put in half of what it called for which seemed to work out fine. Our favorite part was the crispy fried part, so next time, I will make sure to flatten them out a lot more. I might even make them smaller. I look forward to trying these again sometime. Thanks for posting the recipe."
885979,156903,2008-10-15,4,"We really enjoyed this recipe!  Baked speghetti goes way back in our family, so having a nice spin on it was fun.  I used Amy's vegetarian chili and it tasted great."
17803,161048,2006-09-24,4,"Just got done making this, it was simple to make.  I've never had real champagne that I remember but as you poured this it had little bubbles form the pop.  Thou the bubbles went away fast it was still fun to drink.  Hope you get better soon Redneck. "
997065,114415,2014-07-19,5,"I eat a version of this sandwich almost every day. I use a five seed wheat bread...spread it with a little cream cheese and a sprinkling of black pepper. Over the cream cheese just a bit of grated cheddar. Next come the veggies...sliced heirloom tomatoes, a thin Claussen dill slice that I jullienne, romaine cut into strips, some thin sliced cucumber if I have any around and a very thin slice of red onion. Very very delicious and good for you too! Oh...and sometimes I make it into a wrap with a small flour tortilla instead of the bread, slice on the bias. Very good that way as well."
628728,5184,2009-08-31,5,"This was amazing, I loved it so did my husband. Unfortunately I did not have all the ingredients such as brocolli, pearl of barley or celery.  I used stock water and also rolled the beef in flour, salt and pepper as suggested by Lazy Chef 2, it was delicious and definitely an autumn winter staple in our household, many thanks."
1402444,409265,2010-02-22,3,"Wonderful ingredients, and I'm sure I will feel wonderfully healthy after eating it for lunch and be alert all afternoon. But it ended up a bit bland, except for the delightful currents and pinenuts. I am carefully continuing to add salt. I think I overdid both the quinoa and the mushrooms a little bit; I don't know if that's contributing to the blandness. And used portabello and oyster and shiitake. Maybe all shiitake would be more flavorful. Ham or bacon seems like a strange combo to add but would make it more flavorful of course."
169430,201756,2015-10-03,5,Add my praises to the rest. I made 1/2 the amount as it&#039;s just for me and I&#039;m more than pleased with the dressing. Very simple to make up and will be delicious on any salad. I&#039;m thinking of using it to marinate some fish in the next day or two. Should be yummy there too.
1098244,822,2014-04-21,5,"Updated. I read a Heloise column that talked about mixing the  add-ins and cake mix together first. Then mix eggs and oil together, adding to dry ingredients last. I tried it and they came out better. While I love scratch, it&#039;s great to be able to whip up something fast. Red velvet or chocolate with while chocolate chips. Yummy!,"
168087,112755,2007-08-26,4,fantastic banana bread. The honey keeps them stay moist.  Though i find them a bit too sweet. Will reduce the sugar next time by 3/4 of the original amount.  Baked them for 25-30min
60992,159129,2008-02-06,5,This was fantastic and full of flavor! I could not find short ribs at any of the grocery stores this week so I opted for the stew meat option and it worked beautifully. Since I am the only stew lover I also cut the recipe in half. I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of idced tomatoes and 1 t. dark soy sauce instead of the salt. This has just a wonderful look and as I said before the taste is spectacular.
267853,25885,2011-10-31,5,Excellent recipe!  I used 3 very overripe bananas and also threw in about 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  My only complaint was all the dishes that the recipe uses!
375375,185652,2014-06-18,5,"One Farm Guy to another:  I use this recipe at least once a month.  I love its&#039; simplicity, and the result...   However, I must recommend one ingredient:  Any recipe using sauerkraut and pork needs a light sprinkling of caraway seed.  About half a tablespoon of caraway, sprinkled on the sauerkraut before the pork is added, brings out the flavor of both ingredients and adds a subtle flavor of its&#039; own, bringing it all together... Try it, and you&#039;ll like it..."
95743,88948,2004-04-30,5,"Flavor FULL is right.  The 3 oz of blue cheese in the dressing almost sent this burger over the top for me but Dh gobbled it up.  You may want to cut back on the blue cheese in the dressing a bit unless you're a die-hard fan. We both found the burgers perfect as is. Sue L, you're black and blue combination is truly inspired."
197023,314669,2008-11-29,5,"Very tasty and a totally sustaining, satisfying meal. Love its versatility! And love the eggs in this, especially as mine were wonderfully golden free-range eggs. I more than doubled the recipe - using a kilo (just over 2 pounds) of what we call minced beef - and I also added some extra vegetables. This is such an easy one-dish meal! My onions were large not small, and I added 6 cloves of garlic, 2 leeks, half a dozen baby carrots shredded in a food processor and 3 cups of sliced mushrooms. I also added my favourite blend of rosemary and sage (from a grinder) and some thyme. I used low sodium soy sauce: just as yummy. As the carrots were so very sweet and since Australians generally don't use as much sugar in recipes, I used just the one teaspoon of brown sugar. This all made a very large quantity suitable for feeding quite a crowd! In this case, however, it was today's lunch, with a couple of portions reserved for next week's take-to-work lunches :) - and the rest is in the freezer. Thank you for this wonderful recipe, weekend cooker. It's certainly one I'll keep in mind when serving a crowd! Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders 2008."
320849,6930,2008-08-29,5,"I made this using something that was originally Amish friendship bread starter that I had somehow misread the directions for on time to feed etc. I had reduced the amount of sugar by half in the starter and it still seemed to do fine. Anyway, I was fairly certain that this wouldn't work out, being the wrong kind of starter, but I am more interested in ""real"" bread than sweet friendship bread, so that is what I wanted to make. I made the recipe as written (but subbed olive oil and reduced the honey since I had a sweeter starter) and, to my great joy and amazement, it rose beautifully for one thing, and turned out like real, honest bread. It was great as toast and we devoured large amounts of it with a tuscan white bean soup. No, it didn't have the sourdough flavor (I'll probably have to just go the sourdough route one day), but it was like the expensive, more robust ""European"" breads from the grocery store. I can't say I would recommend such brash experimentation because I think it could have gone horribly wrong (everyone always says that other kinds of cooking are far more amenable to flagrant tinkering, but baking is more like chemistry so you'd better play by the rules), but I'll definitely be making this again. Oh, and I also used 50/50 flour because that's what I keep around. Thanks for a great recipe!"
76554,107997,2006-10-06,5,"This was a keeper recipe for us! Absolutly amazing taste with the steak seasoning!

I did not have jumbo shrimp so we just used a pound of previously frozen peel and eat.

Also, I did not have any fresh parsley so I used dried (1/2 Tbsp.), which I put in during the cooking time to let it get soft and it was fine!"
101376,235623,2007-07-16,5,"This was absolutely delicious!
I followed the cooking directions to the letter, using everything plus the optional garlic and ended up using the 1/4 cup beer since I didn't have the red wine on hand. The only beef I had in the freezer was cube steak so I used that.
What I got , didn't really scream for me to put it on buns,there was alot of extra juice,  but screamed more for me to mix with cooked macaroni and top with some shredded cheese LOL  It was fantastic!!!! 
Thanks so much for posting this recipe! Delicious! :)"
166642,264015,2008-09-09,5,These are delicious cookies. I used peanuts and regular-sized M&Ms. My family enjoyed these a lot and I will make them again.
390553,349658,2009-07-27,5,Really good! The BBQ sauce really makes it taste unique. Will make this again for sure!
126440,433667,2010-08-19,5,Wonderful bread.  I will be making this one very often.
64642,18725,2003-04-20,5,Very tender and tasty.  The whole family ate it up and the DIL asked for the recipe.  Thank you for a terrif recipe.
107213,117240,2005-04-18,5,"These are GREAT!  Instead of homemade sausage, I used 1 lb of Jimmy Dean regular, and 1 lb of hot.  These are similar to the sausage balls I used to eat (with the Bisquick) prior to my low-carbing days.  Easy, quick breakfast, thanks!"
252634,39087,2008-03-06,5,My belly is hurting right now from all the pasta! This was so delicious I had to run to computer and thank you before I do the dishes. It's like alfredo with a mystery and the good thing is I know everything that went in it.
18510,84829,2004-03-19,4,"I thought these were very good - nice and fluffy. I didn't think they tasted like donuts, however, but my husband thought they did, and he loved them. I used butter instead of margarine, 1/2 tsp cinnamon instead of 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup. The only problem I had was getting them out of the muffin cups; some of them stuck to the bottom and fell apart when I tried to remove them. Next time I will either dust them with flour after greasing, or use muffin liners. I rolled some of them into the cinnamon/sugar and the rest into confectioner's sugar. I suggest brushing the tops with melted butter before rolling them into the cinnamon/sugar, so it adheres better. Overall, a very good recipe."
39835,44054,2004-07-29,5,Very good and easy to make. My ds made this without any problems following the directions exactly (except for skipping the nuts and lemon flavoring) and it baked to perfection in 1 1/2 hours for us. It was perfect dusted with powdered sugar for a dessert that pleased everyone. Thanks for sharing!
150727,80530,2004-11-15,4,MMMM GOOD! I'm always looking for easy recipes that use ingredients I usually have on hand.  I don't have a blender but I used my hand mixer and this was so good and so easy. Didn't last long either! 
222696,152347,2006-04-22,5,"This was superb. It was just what I was looking for! I actually used Splenda in place of sugar, and no one knew the difference. I used it to fill a two-layer white angel food cake and it was absolutely perfect. Thanks so much for such an easy, quick, DELICIOUS recipe. I loved that it used frozen raspberries to save me some time."
1005883,138719,2013-07-15,0,"This recipe is fantastic.  It tastes exactly like the fondant gelato I had in Rome.  If you feel it is too rich try cutting back on the cocoa.  Although personally &quot;Too rich, there is no such thing!&quot;"
192670,34271,2005-02-13,5,"This recipe is fantastic! I didn't have cream so I used milk instead and increased the amount of butter a little bit.  Came out great, one of my favorites : )"
183445,228879,2013-05-16,5,"I can&#039;t believe I haven&#039;t reviewed this yet! I have now made this about 4 or 5 times - it&#039;s just plain WONDERFUL.  If you like Blue (or Bleu) Cheese Dressing, this one is the Bomb!  I have put it on salads, on wedges of lettuce with hard boiled eggs (just like the Morton&#039;s Salad), and have dipped plenty of chicken wings into it.  You cannot go wrong with this one - I made it exactly as written.  Thanks, AshK!"
128789,29288,2004-04-04,5,"Tebo this recipie is really great!!! Thank you so much! I've been looking for low-cal recipies and didn't find anything! This was g r e a t! I didn't even need to use the sugar since the kiwis where sweet enough. I added half a banana though (i just had it on hand). I also tried the recipie without the whipping cream, for less calories, and it turned out fantastic! THANKS!!!"
284922,152471,2006-05-03,5,"WOW!  These are great!  I was looking for a good side dish that included cottage cheese, and this one was just perfect!  I loved the sprinkle of paprika, and they browned on top just right.  We will definately have this again, thanks so much for posting your recipe :)"
107583,120457,2010-12-19,5,"Decadent!  These really are good.  I subbed chocolate chips for the chunks.  My first sheet was slightly overbaked and turned a little crumbly, but the next sheets were softer, so don't overbake!  These are a large cookie.  Made for Christmas Cookie game at kittencalskitchen.com"
119481,108105,2008-05-10,4,"This was really tasty!!  The only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because I thought the flavors had a more Asian/Chinese flavor than Thai...other than that, they were great!"
359220,14911,2007-01-03,4,"I was pleased at how quickly this breakfast came together.  I was expecting the gravy to be a bit thicker and even added more ""flour slurry"" to increase the viscosity, but it was still a little runny, but tasty notheless.  I'm glad to have a homemade sausage gravy recipe to use again and again.  Thanks!"
116673,18305,2004-11-03,5,"OK, I'm only 22, and been vegan for 4 years. but his is the best cake i have ever had!!!!  Thank you so much for the recipe!"
2001587230,239427,2017-06-17,5,"I literally made an account on here so I can leave this review. I recently got my first apartment and have been looking for easy but tasty recipes that I can make. This Mac N Cheese was UHMAZZINNGG. I think I should have salted my pasta a little more, but the recipe itself is perfect. I can't wait to have some friends over and impress them with this. LOVED IT!"
482933,450741,2014-04-08,5,"A very nice oven recipe. Jazzed up  bread crumbs a bit with salt, pepper, and Italian seasonings. Did halve potatoes so they would get done in hour and raised oven temperature to 375 for salmon. Next time I would drizzle more butter over  while baking to get it more brown. Served with recipe#457328 and recipe#444940. Made for my Spring PAC baby 2014."
2329734,21597,2015-02-01,3,"I&#039;m not crazy about the allspice flavor. I think I will take another reviewer&#039;s recommendation and add vanilla and/or cinnamon next time. Also, rather than melting butter and for the topping, I sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar mixture on top of the muffins before baking. I got about 10 average size muffins from this recipe."
1993720,294646,2011-08-28,1,"These were very easy to make and use very little ingredigents which is a plus.  And after reading all the great reviews I was excited to give them a try.  However, I was not pleased with the taste.  They have a funny aftertaste which I believe is from the baking powder.  I would recommend maybe using a ts less of baking powder.  Maybe that will help with the strange taste."
60260,88948,2005-03-14,4,We are blue cheese lovers and enjoyed these burgers.  I didn't make the dressing this time but will the next.  The charcoal grill is a must for the added flavor.
357358,98869,2013-12-22,4,"Decadent is the adjective that comes to mind for this cake. The batter was dry &amp; heavy so I added in 1/2 cup of cream and it baked up in 40 minutes. As noted by other reviewers, the batter will not pour but must be scraped into the pan with a spatula (no biggie).  I added 1/3 cup raisins and next time will also add chopped walnuts which would complement the flavors and add a bit of texture. Very rich and much appreciated by the folks at the potluck."
39261,48957,2006-05-28,5,Just YUMMY!!! I had to buy a Strawberry Angel Food cake ( they were out of the plain) but that was all the better...This is a Keeper for certain :)
37036,22210,2003-08-06,5,"Great burgers!  They were a nice change from the ""ordinary"" burger!  Wouldn't change a thing... and will definitely make again!
"
814762,170430,2008-04-11,5,"This is quite tasty.  I did the same as mikekey with the splenda.  Instead of the cornstarch I used arrowroot powder, but next time I'll cut the amount in half.  It became too thick, so I thinned it with some water.  I know the egg yolks add fat, and you can't do without them, but this is not that bad for diets.  I put some on a low-fat english muffin and it was YUMMY."
2657454,78194,2014-10-12,5,I strongly recommend these!
146047,49172,2005-11-13,5,"Yum, these were tasty, Missy, and very easy to put together in a food processor. I used a sharp white cheddar, and added a few pinches of nutmeg and black pepper. They need to be served right away as they're best piping hot. I've got a half-batch in the freezer, ready for baking when the urge for cheesy goodness strikes again. Thanks!"
377039,95222,2007-08-09,5,"I can't believe I've not rated these before.  These are the most delicious, tender, juicy, incredible chops I or anyone I've served them to have EVER tasted.

Tips I've found: The sauce is the incredible thing here; make the chops however you want then pour it over them. Water can be substituted for broth in a pinch.  Garlic rather than garlic salt is just as good.  The sauce can be doubled (or quadrupled, or more) and frozen in batches.  The sauce is best when thickened with a bit of cornstarch.  It's delicious on chicken, too.  This sauce is ALWAYS in my freezer now, for a quick answer to a delicious dinner any night of the week! We love this!"
50650,188779,2011-06-24,4,"Excellent recipe! It calls for waaaay too much egg, flour and pancake mix, though. We ended up throwing half of the dry mix away. I would recommend cutting it down to 2 eggs, 1 cup flour and 1/2 cup pancake mix."
29196,320330,2008-08-23,4,"MacChef, you did a great job with this tasty recipe. In an effort to cut costs, I used two tablespoons of pine nuts and 80g prosicutto (both cost the earthwhere I am in Aus). I used chicken thight fillets as I  prefer them to breasts. I don't think these changes altered the outcome of the recipe at all."
2124133,366169,2014-02-09,5,I&#039;ve tried several french bread dough recipes. This one is the best. I slit the bread before letting it rise and that again in the same spots before baking. This will give you those deeper slits you seen in traditional baguettes. I also use two level teaspoons of yeast which is slightly more than a packet. I place a small cast iron pain of water in the bottom of the oven. This will help give the bread a crunchy crust whilst keeping that soft interior. An alternative glaze is an egg yolk whisked with about two TBS of water. This gives a more golden look to the bread. This recipe makes two big baguettes or four smaller ones. I&#039;ve made it three times now and each time with great success. Thanks for a great recipe!
216602,111949,2011-02-17,5,"Delicious, moist, fast, and oh so easy! I used frozen cranberries which I had coated in a bit of flour and defrosted earlier in the day. The times are accurate too, it took me exactly 30 min's to prep, mix and bake.<br/>There were a couple times when I thought for sure I had botched the recipe, the dough was too sticky making it difficult to knead it, but I kept on, and they turned out perfect.<br/>Also I brushed the top with a powdered sugar glaze. But it really didn't need it.<br/>Update: I've played around with this recipe and still love it! I've subbed blueberries, added wheat germ, used milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 etc. Always delicious, moist, fluffy and full of flavor. No need to 'knead' for so long (since I've used juicy blueberries it just gets everywhere) just make sure to have it thoroughly mixed."
239758,213189,2008-06-12,5,"A perfect recipe for a teenage vegetarian boy to learn on. We all agree it is important to let it sit overnight. Four stars on the day it's made, and five stars the next. We garnished each serving with a sprig of parsley. Thanks Amanda for a winner."
489552,386531,2009-08-25,5,"Delicious recipe.  I used Penni pasta cuz that was what I had on hand.  Also I hope you don't mind but I took the recipe to another level.  The followed the recipe up to step #4.  But than I put the pasta in a casserole dish, topped it with a Italiano 3 cheese blend and top it with the bread crumbs and put it in the oven for a few minutes just until the cheese melted.  Yummy :)  I will make this again.  Thank you for posting.  Made for TYM Tag Game."
222696,88740,2007-05-18,3,"This was just okay for us. I followed the recipe and did not make any substitutions, but still the cake turned out much less moist than I had hoped. We ate it warm, and it was sort of. . .lacking in flavor, we thought. I don't think I'd make this again, although it has a few pluses: it's super easy to make, it's quick, and it doesn't require tons of dishes. Thanks for sharing."
4740,154696,2016-09-26,2,This was so-so. I had to add a lot of salt - somehow did not have flavor.
146284,22542,2009-11-07,5,"Great salad.  I made it the day before, omitting the apples and nuts until serving. The cranberries softened perfectly, and the combination of flavours is wonderful."
1275037,418322,2010-08-26,5,"What a wonderful recipe. My husband spent two years in Brazil doing missionary work. When he came home and started taste testing the sauce it was I rember that sauce. I did do some adaptations due to what I did and did not have. No ham so I added 1/2 pound more of the beef, and only oven ready lasagne noodles, so I added a 1/2 cup of water to the meat sauce, and 1/2 cup of milk to the white sauce for the needed 1 cup of extra liquid to cook the noodles, and it came out perfect, cooked for 1 hour to properly cook the noodles. I used all of the ingredients in each layer, even the kids who while they like lasagne don't like the riccotta, and by the time they pick it out half of their piece is left on the plate, not this time they took healthy pieces, and ate it all, using my homemade bread to get every bite. My husband and a friend who ate with us each had 2 pieces, and claimed dibbs on the rest for lunch the next day. I definetly will be making this again. Thanks for posting."
11044,34797,2005-07-01,5,"These are very tasty.
I was having trouble getting the bread crumbs to stick after the rings had been dipped into the flour. So I dipped them into the egg mixture again before the bread crumbs and they stuck much better to make the coating nice and crispy. I'll be making these again!"
125109,167775,2008-02-10,5,"What a tasty hummus. I had this saved in a cookbook for a while and made it so I could dip some cut up veggies.I had one problem though, I couldn't stop eating the chickpeas after they came out of the oven..:)I added a pinch of smoked paprika because I thought it would give it a little kick. Thanks for the keeper CG!"
1803712465,325664,2015-01-27,4,Great recipe! minimuffins take ten minutes but they lose their orange-ness. I am adding more zest and some concentrated flavoring or extract next time.
279367,119372,2007-11-21,5,"I absolutely love this recipe. So far, I've made three batches. They are very moist and oooooh! so delicious. We've eaten them for breakfast, late night snacks, and everything in between."
37820,60235,2004-02-28,5,These were so easy and YUMMY!!  i will be making lots of these in the years to come.  thanks for posting!
128268,10258,2008-08-22,0,"Excellent dip!  Very fast and easy.  The best thing was, I had all the ingredients, didn't have to go to the store.  Everyone loved it.  I did add basel and it was awesome!  Thank you."
11286045,330437,2018-03-09,5,This is yummy! I would adjust the sugar by half and add a lil bit of nutmeg along with the cinnamon I added to the batter.I added raisins and may add walnuts next time.I didnt make the topping and glad I didnt because it was sweet enough.Will make again.
325703,105670,2010-05-13,0,"I have been making this recipe for years- it is yummy! I mix my cream cheese and grated cheddar, and add some chopped green onions. I also blanch my jalapeno halves so they are not quite as spicy. They disappear at parties!"
388044,127269,2007-09-06,5,"These were really yummy! Easy to make too. They go really well with tomatoes and salad, this will be great in summer when I have heaps of zucchinis in the veggie garden!"
76951,105679,2006-09-16,3,We liked it and will probably make again.  I felt like the flavors needed to blend for a longer period of time.  Next time I'll make the salmon mixture and the dressing in advance and let meld overnight.
199848,321529,2008-11-11,5,"Tastes just like lasagna, but you can make this in a fraction of the time it takes to bake a lasagna.  I used ground beef and pork, but no veal.  I put chopped onion in with the meat when I browned it.  We really enjoyed this and I'll make this again.  Thanx!"
369715,51283,2010-10-24,5,We really enjoyed this. I made as directed other then I didn't add the dill weed. We were pleasantly surprised with this recipe. I didn't measure the sour cream I just eye balled it. Will be making this again. It was quick and easy to make.
485151,25885,2009-05-07,4,This made a very dense banana bread- which is just the kind I like! I loved the texture and it baked perfectly in my oven. Next time I will add 1 tsp vanilla & cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to it.
223854,227991,2008-06-06,5,"Yum!  I made this for lunch today and it was perfect.  Took me five minutes to prepare and five minutes for the cheese to melt slighly.  I had to substitute the French bread to Ciabatta (Italian Bread), use regular tomato and I used fresh Mozzarella (Cherry Bocconcini's). Thank you PaulaG - *Made for Zaar World Tour 4*"
28177,351998,2012-03-28,5,"December 11, 2010: Delicious!  DS (17) has been asking for ""regular"" spaghetti for weeks (as in no beans, no seafood, no weird ingredients.  LOL), so this was my treat for him last night.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  I loved how easy it was!  I had fresh basil on hand, halved the recipe and added 1lb ground beef, which I cooked with the onion and garlic, drained & then continued with the recipe.   We'll look forward to making this again & I think it would be great for OAMC.  Next time I'll make a full recipe, divide in half, vacuum pack and freeze one for a quick weeknight meal down the road.  Thanks for sharing, Shelly!  Made & enjoyed for the Let's P-A-R-T-Y! event.  :)  ETA:  I forgot to mention that I also added a few splashes of Malbec red wine to add some depth.  It's an excellent recipe!  :D"
165845,66412,2007-10-20,5,Love this!  Definitely a dinner with which to impress others.
239758,255140,2008-06-17,5,"Thank you, thank you, thank you for posting this recipe. It reminds me that Zaar should allow 10 stars on very rare occasions. Don't change a thing -- just make a double batch!"
1751197,242097,2011-01-02,5,"I love this recipe,  instead I cooked the leeks hole and the potatoes halved.  Then I sliced the leeks and the potatoes arranged in layers.  My husband loved it, thanks."
64583,121490,2008-09-08,5,"This bread has it all - wonderful texture and moistness, and delicious taste with just the right amount of cinnamon.  Made according to instrctions except I used reduced fat sour cream with great results."
107651,28215,2009-09-24,4,"Apples and raspberries, two of my favourite things!!  I had to use up some Gravenstein apples and some frozen raspberries, sadly I did not have a cup and DD said next time you will have to add more raspberries!!! It is a delicious dessert, I used brown sugar, flour and butter for the topping..and the 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon was perfect for our tastes."
586469,153654,2008-01-31,4,"Really good, helps with the blandness of couscous."
27643,41866,2002-10-04,5,"Yum! These are so, so good! Sort of like a creamy, chewy brownie. I sprinkled chopped pecans on top. This is very easy to make and we really loved them! I will definitely make this again. Thanks Karen!! "
1245168,20577,2009-05-11,5,We (my Husband and I) really enjoyed this!  I made it a tad different.  I used tri-color rotini pasta and a can of ready-cut diced tomatoes.  I made sure to drain the tomatoes and dry them by soaking up any additional liquid using a paper towel before adding.  I also added some fresh Italian herbs at the end!  WONDERFUL!!!  I will make this again and again.  PERFECT for us!!!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!
254446,50774,2009-03-30,5,Easy and Delish! My hubby who loves Manicotti has requested I make this more often.....little does he know I already have some frozen! :)
329769,296369,2008-05-30,5,*Reviewed during ZWT4* Mmm....these were great. Like a hazelnut macaroon. I used 150 grams hazelnut meal to make these. Mine weren't thick enough to roll and I had no more hazelnuts to add - so I piped them rather than rolling. Must have made mine too big as I made around 30. My daughters loved them and even sandwiched them together with Nutella. I think they would taste just like a rocher if we had topped them with some melted chocolate. Photo also to be posted.
1320105,34569,2010-03-23,4,"These bars had a very nice flavor and went over okay.  I personally loved the sweet and salty mixture.  The adults seemed to like this more than the kids (at a party); athough, I'm not sure why.  I heard several people say they tasted like a payday and they weren't even told the name of these bars!  I am not much of a marshmallow fan at all, but I have to say, I liked these.  I will probably only make these for functions/get-togethers since my kids didn't enjoy them much and so I won't eat the entire pan!  Thanks for sharing."
834893,4050,2008-05-07,5,Delicious! Best cookies ever!
344974,129040,2006-08-23,5,make the oats 4+ cups(til not runny).  I also used 1/2 brown sugar.  YUMMMMM!  Sinful!
1178797,66409,2009-11-11,3,"Overall a pretty good recipe. The scones baked up nicely and puffed up in size. It was missing the 'scone' flavor that I'm used to, perhaps due to too much butter and a tad much sugar. For some reason I did not get as much yield as the recipe indicates ( only got 8 scone triangles, 2-3 inches in length)."
69662,47832,2003-04-06,5,Oh these pancake recipes are the best!  Watch out IHOP! (International House of Pancakes)
103876,108908,2010-09-22,5,This is amazing!  Just like I remember it when my mom used to make it when I was a kid.  I used beef instead of chicken and it was great!  Thanks for posting.
17803,238167,2007-09-16,5,Great cake and what a fun way to use up all my sprinkles I have in the cupboards!!  I've made between 200 and 250 angelfood cakes since I got married 20 years ago this month. A big thanks to our neighbor Artie F. for giving me her recipe and starting my life down that angelfood path. lol  If you have never made one give it a try you'll never go back to store bought or box mix.  I made this for Zaar tag 2007 game
1231715,95222,2009-04-09,5,"It was immaculate. The smaller the pan the better so the chops could soak in. sauce is wonderful! quick and easy, it definitly suprised me!"
2001398266,107786,2017-02-19,0,Im 15 an I made this for my mom really good Thanks!!!
2001591921,247394,2018-05-05,2,"Confusing directions. Mix cornbread as directed on box, but then the directions here are different."
1168865,118391,2009-03-27,5,We really enjoyed this! I can't think of any changes I would make so 5 stars :-D
156034,46624,2006-05-02,5,Really good stuff!
1681493,336746,2010-10-01,4,Thought is was great. Needed some salt. I agree with the not microwaving the peppers crunchy was nice!! I also firmly agree with mixing Mozzarella in the layers. Super tasty!!<br/>Served it with corn. Was a great match. Thankssss
136511,48201,2006-09-17,5,"I thought this was delicious and filling!  I cut the recipe in half and I did use 98% fat free soups instead of the full fat kind and it was still tasty. And I also omitted the step of heating the soup through on the stove with the beef.  I just added the soups, spices, and beef to the casserole dish and mixed them that way. DBF did not care for it because he said the fries were not crispy enough for his taste.  This could have been my fault as I may not have cooked it long enough.  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe!"
110946,24605,2006-09-02,4,Great recipe! I also used whole wheat flour and the low fat (skim) milk. I did not have the applesauce so I splurged and went for olive oil. Additionally I added 1 Teaspoon of cinnamon. I think I could have even doubled that. Great bread!
68010,17978,2005-01-03,4,Very good & super easy.  I agree that half the butter is plenty; more is maybe a little too much for our taste.  Otherwise perfect and couldn't be simpler.
900264,112889,2016-12-05,5,This worked perfect. Followed the recipe exactly. Didn't worry about the ratio of cider vinegar to water. I made 3 pounds at once. Again-- perfect! Thanks so much for sharing this.
54716,28439,2003-01-05,5,Oh yeah......  This is clears the palata and will refresh you more than any other drink.  I made this with unflavored sparkling water.  I can imagine how this would be just the perfect summer refreshment.  This is a keeper!
537937,161217,2008-03-19,5,"I think I have found a new way to make Scotcheroo's and/or RiceKrispie Treats.  These are the best Kitty.  I think what's an added bonus is putting them in an 8x8.  Never thought of that b/f.  I love how big each bar is.  But, what's not to love about p.b. (my absolute obsession) and chocolate, plus the saltiness of peanuts.  Bravo!!!  Made for 123 HitWonders~"
806883,67256,2008-04-04,5,"I made this for my son's first birthday and everyone LOVED it.  I was able to make a two layer round cake and then a separate round for my son to dive into.  My husband is a huge chocolate fan, but even preferred this over the chocolate cake that we also served.  I may try this cake with chocolate frosting in the future and see how it goes."
440942,187289,2009-09-21,4,"The burgers turned out great, but my family does not like some of the spices in the Mrs. Dash Chicken Grilling Blend, I should have read it before I added it, therefore it kinda ruined the meal."
714748,392347,2010-02-04,5,"Simple, straightforward, and delicious. I've made this twice now; the first time I followed it exactly and it was delicious. The second time I added some cilantro, lime juice, and pureed tofu, which was also good, but is a whole different soup. The original recipe is awesome on it's own and I'll definitely make it again."
38260,13398,2002-08-08,4,"This is a very good cake.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out very moist and tender.  The cream cheese frosting was a wonderful topping.  One of my co-workers claimed it was her favorite so far.

I could imagine it being even better with either raisins in the cake or bits of peacans sprinkled on the icing.  And will try Nye's idea of the nutmeg or cinnamon in the cake batter.  YUM!

(I must admit it took me a while to figure out why this was called a Cinderella Cake - duh!)  :)"
183964,128746,2015-04-23,5,So simple and soooo delicious!
174991,98370,2005-01-16,5,This is a great dish that goes together quickly and tastes. Also nice since the ingredents are stuff that you would have in your household.  Thanks KelBel.
45763,138062,2010-03-07,5,"This recipe is GREAT! I subbed whole milk and lemon juice mixture for  the buttermilk and used only a 3/4 of a cup.  It's so moist and so-o good.
Thanks for sharing."
447768,14358,2008-11-14,2,"I followed this recipe exactly, right down to the white pepper.  I know I'm in the minority here but I just did not care for this recipe at all.  I really did not like the taste of this rub, and believe me, I like my spice.  Also, the chops were very dry.  Even with thinner chops, I still don't care for the taste of the rub.  Would not make again."
46731,35992,2004-12-25,5,"These were great! Made them one cold afternoon for a treat, they didn't last 1/2 an hour."
308765,161902,2007-03-18,5,"Awesome cupcakes, chocolaty and light and fluffy.  The frosting was also light and the perfect topping.  I'd assume you need to refrigerate any frosting you have left over for cupcakes you won't eat right away, as the cool whip will probably melt.  As you can see from the picture, hubby loved these, you can't tell they're so low in calories!  They don't taste like coffee at all, I think the granules just add richness to the cake."
369715,357892,2012-01-22,5,I loved these and just ate these for dinner. I didn't have dry french onion soup mix so I used a can of french onion soup and added some water to make two cups. Mine did take longer to cook but they were so good. I didn't add salt or pepper.
28177,83347,2011-01-10,5,"My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I had some leftover apricot/pineapple marmalade from another recipe and pineapple juice, leftover from mixing drinks the other night.  After I stirred both together they were a little on the tart side, so I sprinkled in some smoked paprika and a dash of chili powder to balance that out.  Your technique for cooking the tenderloin produced a moist, tender piece of meat.  It was perfectly cooked in 60 minutes, so I never got a chance to cook it with the foil off, but that didn't matter to us at all.  Thanks for sharing your delicious creation, Kellie!  :)  Made and enjoyed for the BB tag game."
330561,25234,2006-12-08,5,"I made these for my first time hosting Thanksgiving Dinner. This was wonderful and much enjoyed by DH's family (who have not had any sweet potatoes as part of their Thanksgiving before).


I also used balsamic vinegar (Recipe #28911). The onions may have been my favorite part!"
2001894539,9054,2017-12-28,5,Started out with the recipe as is but found they were too soft to flip so instead of adding more flour I added some left over stuffing from turkey dinner which made them more workable by hand to shape them. Also added in a pinch of hot pepper flakes to give it kick. Cooked them in bacon fat and topped them with sour cream to serve. My hubby decided he wanted to try maple syrup on them and really liked it. This is definitely an anything goes side dish.
92290,15870,2003-07-20,4,"I made this last night and it was very delicious.  On another plate, I put cooked ramen noodles, sliced red onion, cilantro leaves and carrots - I used those to wrap up with the chicken.  That made the dish absolutely fabulous ... however, the peanut sauce was a little too sweet and not too spicy for me.  Next time I will add less sugar and more red pepper.

"
443217,211938,2012-10-17,5,"Excellent recipe! My kids are picky eaters when it comes to ""healthier"" options for baked goods, and they loved them! I also cut the sugar in half and used a 1/4-1/2 cup of agave nectar as well.  I found that 30 mins was a little too long to bake them for. Mine came out perfect at 25 mins. Thanks for posting!"
47421,202833,2008-02-25,5,"My teenage son and his girlfriend made this last night for dinner.  It was absolutely wonderful.  It did taste just like the Olive Garden Ziti.  We wondered why the Olive Garden Ziti sauce was pinkish in color, and this recipe explains that since you mix alfredo sauce in with the red sauce.  The kids used spaghetti sauce instead of the 4 cups plain tomato sauce.  Everyone should try this one."
2208246,294681,2012-03-11,5,"Love this recipe!  The use of chicken broth gives the cheese sauce a less ""bulky"" consistency.  I doubled this recipe and used cut up steamed broccoli crowns instead of the peas.  I also used a combination of half and half and 1% milk to cut down on calories.  I had enough for two casseroles, one which I brought to a sick friend and her family loved it!  Don't usually like processed foods, but those onion rings on top put this recipe over the top!"
222564,236014,2009-01-11,4,"After filling the mushrooms I prepared them in a frying pan, rather than oven, upside down to cook the filling. Quite a success."
286566,387716,2010-01-06,5,"I scaled this back to 1 serve for the DM using a fresh peach (which was a tad over the 2oz of peach flesh required).  Well she loved it - was wandering if it was her birthday and if it was a treat, well this is one treat she may be getting on a more regular basis using fresh fruit that is in season.  Thank you Debbwl, made for Everyday A Holiday."
211566,115657,2005-05-06,5,This has become one of our favorites. My son can't get enough!
121553,101122,2004-10-15,4,While making this dish I was not so sure how it would turn out.....I followed the instructions to the T and the  end result was good and my family loved it.Thanks Char.
1803018654,170480,2014-08-29,0,This recipe is absolutely wonderful! I&#039;ve made it twice in the last 3 weeks at the request of my husband. I make a lot of freezer meals and this one is a great addition to our rotation. I combined this with rice the first time and I&#039;ll make it with mashed potatoes this time. This is a definite keeper. Thank you for posting it.
173579,18719,2009-07-02,5,We thought this was really yummy.  The peanut butter mixture taste like fudge.  Very simple to make.  Thanks for posting.
2324285,91112,2013-05-28,5,"Simple, flavorful, and so easy to throw together.  I&#039;ve been making salads like these for a long time now- this one is good too.  I&#039;ll be trying it with crumbled goat cheese instead of feta next time."
735086,55520,2008-07-24,5,"I loved these pancakes.  I would also reduce the milk to about 2 cups. I have made it twice.  Once with buttermilk, and once with 2% milk. Both times they tasted great.  I also took advice from another reviewer and mashed the bananas.  I will definitely be making these often. Thanks for a great recipe!"
2001968806,69826,2018-02-02,1,????Wanted to make but it does not say WHAT SIZE of can of evaporated milk????
55380,89627,2006-01-12,5,"I actually only made the sauce portion of this as I had leftover cabbage/noodle lo mein. The sauce is very smooth and creamy and even with low-fat coconut milk it has a rich flavor. It has a more mellow flavor than I usually associate with Thai food but that worked well for me today and I can always kick the heat up another time if necessary. The sauce was thin, but that may have been due to the low-fat coconut milk. It worked fine anyway ~ I served it over the cabbage/noodles, basmati rice, and tofu cubes, and then used it as a dipping sauce for some Thai shrimp spring rolls. This was a quick and easy Thai fix and I can already tell it will become a lunch staple around here. Thanks for posting!"
227024,67256,2010-01-04,5,Loved it!
2526242,473004,2012-11-25,5,These are amazing :) everyone in my family enjoys these I added 1/4 cup crushed almonds this last time to the top and it was so good
824337,51699,2009-11-14,5,"This was really nummy! I totally forgot to thaw my chicken, so by the time I went to make it is was too late. I added some macaroni to the soup to beef it up in place of the chicken. still good!"
122350,63936,2004-06-22,4,"This was very good, but I wouldn't rave about it. I think I was expecting alot more after reading all the reviews. The sauce had a very nice flavor. "
670932,278278,2009-05-19,5,"Simple recipe...delicious muffins! While making this, I noticed the dough was a little too thick for my liking so I just added about a tablespoon of water just to thin out the dough. I also used just a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and I added maybe another 1/4 cup of blueberries. I also used 1/4 cup of sugar and a 1/4 cup of Splenda. I also used a light vanila flavored soymilk. The muffins turned out great. I can't wait to make some more!"
546216,22782,2008-10-22,5,It is that good!  Thanks for sharing!
64625,105846,2005-02-15,5,"Good, clear instructions for an easy to prepare, delicious dish.  I used sour cream in my mixture and lots of onions and got a very generous amount of saucy caramelized onions for the 2 servings.  Real comfort food. The chops were nicely done.  Thanks!"
679953,329321,2008-12-17,5,"THIS WAS GREAT !!! Flavorful, tasty, and the house had a great aroma while cooking.  It was gone in a day.  Made for potluck tag."
1072593,118985,2014-08-05,5,"Temporarily turned my teeth blue, though I believe that the stains on one&#039;s character are permanent.  Excellent jelly!"
2702941,495275,2013-02-20,5,This was an amazing recipe! Very flavorful! It was a perfect combination of ingredients and was real easy to make. My whole family liked it!
2002289556,254206,2018-10-01,0,"Red Food Coloring: There are not any scientific studies that show food coloring hurts humming birds, it is a myth."
36810,141983,2010-08-17,5,"This was super easy!!!!  Although it tasted as if I spent all day in the kitchen.  I used a combination of mozzarella, parmesan, and swiss because it was what I had on hand.  I also used 1 cup milk and 1 cup half-n-half.  Threw some shrimp in and voila - dinner!  Highly recommend this recipe.  Parker tell your mom I said thanks a bunch!!!!"
385678,235943,2007-11-20,5,"This was a wonderful, flavorful recipe!  Followed the recipe as is and ate it with white sticky rice.  My children and husband devoured it in minutes!  My family loves peanut sauce and make it often, so this was a nice new way for us to eat it.  We will be making this again!  Thanks so much!  Made for Peanut Sauce Tag."
1665754,61718,2013-02-22,5,This roast was delicious.  Would do again.  thanks!!
266635,37655,2017-08-19,5,This pie is absolutely delicious. I did substitute the homemade pie crust for a store bought one and I substituted an all-natural sugar substitute for the sugar. Didn't skip the whipped cream though. : ) This is a keeper and a pie that I will definitely make for my family and friends.
30534,158838,2012-07-19,0,Delicious ! I made the recipe as directed. DH loved the sauce.
386585,171943,2011-03-09,5,"This is a great alternative to your standard chili recipe, and quite easy too!  I could not find a 48. oz. jar of great northern beans and ended up using three 15 oz. cans of beans (2 were great northern and 1 was pinto).  I also could not find the right size can of chicken, and used two 12.5 oz. cans.  I used hot salsa (because I like things spicy).  I did need to use 2 T. of masa harina to thicken the chili, but did not need to add any additional salt.  The end result was very flavorful and satisfying.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Spring PAC 2011."
171210,481059,2013-07-26,5,"These are probably the best burgers I&#039;ve ever had! I topped mine with some guacamole, chipotle mayo, and ketchup...awesome! And it was quick and easy to make. Thank you so much for such a tasty recipe that the whole family loved."
315565,235608,2008-06-22,4,Terrific comfort food - easy to do and very tasty - made for ZWT 4.
858363,393626,2010-04-08,5,"Oh my goodness!  I cannot believe no one has reviewed this yet!  How fabulous!  True to their name, they literally melt away in your mouth.  I ground up the pecans pretty fine, because I do not like the texture of large nuts in my desserts, but the flavors were fabulous!  I also drizzled some homemade Kahlua on top, and loved it!  My only negative comment?  After about one bite, I felt I might have a heart attack if I ate more!  (I ate more anyway!)  Thanks for posting!  Made for PAC Spring 2010."
215829,99341,2005-11-12,0,"I found this recipe fairly bland for my taste.  So - I made it again but did not rinse the sauerkraut, used beer instad of water and added a heaping tablespoon of dijon mustard at the end.  This version got raves.  I do appreciate the recipe since I did not know about sauteing onions in butter and adding shredded potatoes."
864943,397088,2011-11-16,1,"Gebhardt was famous for grinding the dried chilis into a powder. This was his base. This recipe lacks that. For hot chili - use New Mexico powder (and omit the red pepper). For mild, use Ancho with or without red pepper or crushed chili seeds. Paprika, Cumin, salt, Mexican Oregano, freshly ground coriander seeds, black pepper and celery salt will give you a blend that is just like the store kind."
2000498330,30920,2018-06-12,5,Delicious cheesy mashed potato dish. Makes a ton. Simple prep. Very happy.
1490637,21304,2009-12-20,4,This recipe rocks!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it could stand to have more chives.  Also I used celery salt and I think a bit of season salt would give it more flavor.  We had a barbecue last night and this was everyone's FAVORITE dish!
859548,429592,2012-10-14,5,Absolutely loved it! Unfortunately didn't have strawberries on hand and had to use evaporated milk instead of light cream but it was still sooooo good! The whole family loved it!
41578,74330,2005-01-19,5,"This dip was made early in the morning for our nightly ""Happy Hour"".  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for sharing,  CheesyGal.  We will make this again.
"
1120384,322931,2009-01-09,5,DH and I loved this and was just as good the next day warmed up. He felt it matched/surpassed our favorite Italian restaurant dish. Really no changes though may throw in some pine nuts next time - Really a keeper and will do again - cooking the ham does make a big difference - be sure and do that
226863,266272,2011-10-09,5,"I love a sauce that simmers all day on the stove.....so, I let mine simmer for 5 hours, and added some merlot to it.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  I used ground sirloin and italian sausage for the meat.  I also added the mushrooms.  This makes a very hearty, thick sauce!  Delicious!!"
17803,115846,2005-04-09,5,I liked the sweet taste the honey gave the cottage cheese.  This makes a big enough portion that you could serve this to two people.  You have to give a few extra stirs to blend in the honey so wait to add the banana.  I think next time I will drain the cottage cheese so there is not so much liquid.
587978,384829,2010-03-22,5,"This was great! It was well worth the effort put into getting the correct ingredients. My hubby didnt love it, but said it was good. My son and I gobbled it up! The biscuits were very good also. Just a hint of thyme made them savory. Thanks for a great recipe! I definately have left overs to take to work, and I am sure its going to warm up just great. Thanks Sarasota!"
227652,110785,2006-03-21,4,"Very good! I didn't use the nutmeg & used applesauce for the oil. I also added 1/4 cup mini choc chips. The taste was a little different from all the oats but it was great with the choc chips. Very moist, too. Thanks! "
86512,32458,2004-01-05,4,This is a good drink. I cut down on the tequila and increased the tomato juice. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon  horseradish which added some zip to the drink. I will be making this drink again. Thanks Dee!!
40211,85570,2004-10-06,5,"These are amazing! A little chewy at the edges, soft and fudgy in the centre, light in texture without being ""cake-y""... how can something so perfect come from a recipe that is this simple? ""Throw in a bowl and mix"". I love that! They're foolproof. I'm on my 3rd pan in less than 2 weeks. "
809532,130656,2010-01-17,5,"Very good and super easy.  We added more sun-dried tomatoes, just our preference, and gobbled it up with some wine!"
1457318,375005,2010-05-30,5,"I made this sauce to serve with some shrimp that I grilled (without all the herbs, just salt, pepper, olive oil). The sauce is really good, very different, cool and sweet. Great in the summer time."
182010,161212,2006-05-18,5,"So healthy and low calorie and low fat, yet very rich tasting and satisfying.  Just the right undertone of heat.  I did add a bit of water and cover the cabbage and let it cook almost ten minutes.  It was then a combination of soft and crispy--just right.  I did not have asafetida powder (Indian saffron is another name for it) and added a bit of extra turmeric at the end.  I also added some grated coconut--an excellent addition.  The fresh cilantro gives the whole dish a very bright flavor."
720912,24476,2008-09-18,5,wonderful and easy- a great sidedish-thanks so much!
76951,39945,2011-10-28,4,"Fun, easy, and tasty too!  I took mine to work and placed on a round tray with witches hats - Recipe#103060 - on the perimeter and the pumpkins in the middle.  It made a very cute display (wish I would have taken a picture).  Be sure to make the pumpkin balls small as they are very rich."
466764,127091,2007-04-08,4,"Cooling & Refreshing! Instead of low fat milk and coffee creamer, I added a tablespoon of chocolate cocoa powder and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Deliiiicious! Great for sweltering summer nights. :)"
542159,370174,2010-11-03,5,Nice new twist on garlic bread. Tomatoes have just gone out of season here so will have to wait till next summer before we can try this again. Thanks for the post
678862,172041,2008-06-30,5,"These muffins are really great - I made the chocolate version - addded 1/2 cup of cocoa powder, used freshly ground whole grain flour in place of the all-purpose ( I increased it from 2 1/2 cups to 3 cups as I always do when using freshly ground flour), used unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 the amount of canola oil, and added a generous amount of semisweet chocolate chips.  I will be making these often - thanks for posting.  Made and enjoyed for Aussie/NZ Recipe Swap #17."
615156,57059,2009-11-16,5,"Excellent recipe...the wine, spices, and hot sauce make a tasty combination!  My husband LOVED it, too!!"
1658850,60119,2013-04-20,5,"Thank you for a go-to french fry recipe!!! I&#039;ve searched for a very long time. This is it! Something that can be done in time for that spur of the moment decision to have french fries, GREAT fries!!!"
1667251,216691,2016-04-23,5,These are as good as the regular version.  I used orange infused olive oil for a hint of orange flavor.
198741,38203,2007-08-03,4,Sweet.. we loved it.
80353,451372,2011-06-26,5,Sensational!  Loved the zing of the ginger and snap of the lime.  Woke up all my taste buds. :-)
237021,21328,2005-08-21,3,"Probably chef error, but my roast turned out very tough & dry.  I figured it was the crock pot, what could I possibly do wrong?!  The gravy is really more an ""au Jus"" sauce, but is great.  I'll try again with a different cut of meat."
25356,22217,2002-04-03,4,"This is similar to one of our family favorites only, better. I added a can of cream of broccoli soup in addition to the two cream of chicken to make a little ""gravy"". The next time, though, I will reduce the cheese by half. Three cups was a bit much for our tastes. Still, this recipe has replaced the old one in my recipe file!"
469903,179598,2008-01-24,5,"Exceptional vegetarian stew! My son insisted on taking the leftovers in his lunch the next... it was that good!  I used only the egg whites (just a personal preference).  This is truly a wonderful healthy soup for cold winter nights, but I wouldn't hesitate to make it year-round. I loved that it was low fat, low calorie with plenty of protein; makes very good sized proportions too.  Thanks so much for sharing, I'll be making this again.. and again... and (well, you get the idea)... !!"
424680,456955,2011-09-09,5,"In a word, DELICIOUS! I used a large orange so had lots of zest (which I like) & used Triple Sec for the liqueur, then followed the recipe right on down! We we thoroughly delighted with this cake, & I don't mind telling everyone that the 2 of us, over a period of several days, had it all to ourselves! An absolute winner of a recipe! Thanks for sharing it! [Made & reviewed in Zaar Stars recipe tag]"
199198,296819,2010-07-11,5,"Wow, we loved these potatoes! Served them with grilled pork chops, and veggies. I'll be making these again soon. Thanks!"
407088,106615,2009-11-08,4,"VERY easy, but very bland too.  I made them to go with cheese stuffed shells and they just didn't go well together.  More like a biscuit than a roll.  I asked my family if some minced garlic and shredded cheese would do the trick and they said, ""They'd be ok that way.""  Well, it was neat to make these and like I said, VERY easy!  Thanks!"
598519,119158,2008-12-30,5,Even the picky kids happily gobbled this up!  What a great recipe.  Will be sure to pass this on to my brothers who got their first deer this year.
311203,246043,2010-02-08,5,"These were really good.  They were nice and soft in the middle.  Be careful not to overcook them, though.  I did that with the first pan because I thought they should be darker colored and they turned out crunchy.  14 minutes was the perfect amount in my oven.  Thanks for the recipe!"
191990,131911,2005-10-12,4,"These were tasty, a little crumbly but they're like sugar cookies & are very yummy to dip in coffee.  Thanx Paula, for a fun afternoon baking! ( I used star cookie cutters)"
130663,34527,2004-06-08,5,"I picked the hottest day today to make this jam.Tried it already and it,s a keeper.I will make some more but in the fall."
1163533,282720,2010-01-01,3,"Something went awry with this recipe. The dough was incredibly stiff, I could hardly roll it thin. Then the end result ended up tasting like baking powder. I gave 3 stars b/c my husband ended up eating some of the crackers with hummus. I followed the recipe to a tee, but felt it lacked some liquid."
39334,257828,2008-03-23,5,"Wow was this ever good!!! Mine tasted more like a dense apple bread than a cake, but I never got my eggs and sugar to form peaks, so maybe that was it. But this was still yummy...we didn't use any glaze, just ate it as is. This is extremely moist and delicious; I followed the directions exactly and it was so easy to make and made a great dessert for Easter dinner. Thanks for posting!!"
41334,12128,2005-12-02,3,"The onion soup flavor was a bit overpowering for the mild chicken.  I may try it again, this time omitting the lipton soup and using cream of chicken instead of mushroom."
164276,71616,2011-03-09,4,"The last step with the chocolate chips and butter did not turn out for me.  It was a gloopy mess.  Not at all what the pictures resembled.  I actually tried it twice and was mad after I wasted the ingredients.  I decided to put both of my tries into the kitchen aid and add milk and some powdered sugar to see what would happen.  Turned out better than the gloopy mess.  Next time I will just make a chocolate frosting to put on the top.   Other than that, they tasted great.  Will make again but with my own frosting recipe."
10120,28141,2002-07-05,5,"I used this recipe for the 4th of July get together for 24 people.  Course I have to increase this by 3rd's because I had about 12lbs. to get ready.  This is the most fantastic recipe for port tenderloin  it was moist and tender,  the flavor was outstanding. Needless to say I didn't have any leftovers.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.  It is a keeper in my house."
297282,13408,2008-12-30,5,"Thank you soooooo much for this Great recipe. We had an extremely cold day here in Canada, and I was thinking about making Beef Stew all day.......Something quick & easy that I could throw together after work. Well, this was the perfect recipe......I didn't change a thing. It turned out ""Perfect"".....My wife kept making those Mmmmm, Mmmmm, Mmmmm, sounds while eating dinner. (I even think she loves me a bit more now....) Thanx again....

Rob :)"
1803717667,124184,2015-01-28,5,"Great Recipe :)&lt;br/&gt;I went on holiday to Jamaica last summer. In the hotel we stayed in they had, what they called &quot;jerk sauce&quot; It was in a large pan and kept on the heat, it was used as pouring sauce, I suppose it was a bit like a thin soup. Does anybody know a recipe for this as it was amazing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks"
29813,19383,2004-04-30,5,"FANTASTIC!! This was soooo good. what a neat change for dinner, This was very filling, great comfort food. thanks "
315565,423692,2010-05-07,5,Fabulous brekky - all pantry ingredients too. I used apples and stewed plums as my fruit mix. I halved the recipe easily so there is lots left - I can eat this sort of thing three meals in a row so there is no problem with the leftovers
90767,3741,2003-12-02,5,This was so much easier than I expected!  I substituted 1 cup of Splenda for sugar because I am diabetic and only 12oz of berries but it worked out perfectly.  So much better than the canned stuff!  Thanks Dancer^ !
1800268957,383847,2013-12-04,0,"I made this delightful cake for Thanksgiving. It was the hit of desserts. It may have been because it was a shocker as to how incredible it was, but definitely easy to make and delicious! I would recommend anyone at least trying it. Take your time when layering and make sure it is evenly spread out, that makes a difference. Enjoy!"
106624,48546,2007-07-03,5,Prepared this recipe using chicken wings...It is very good....I also added two minced garlic cloves...... This is a good recipe just as is...
385512,215648,2012-01-15,5,I had my doubts...but this one is a keeper!  I will be making this again!  Yummm
128949,78814,2008-03-05,5,"What a hit! I kknew that I didn't have time to roll out individual rolls, so I lined a 9x9 dish with crescent rolls (there was enough left to make a lattice top). I mixed together the sauce & the chicken (I used 3 breasts). I cut back on the cheddar cheese too. Next time I will add in some veggies! I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes."
26041,12121,2002-03-26,4,"This was so easy to make, and the pork chops were very tender.  I think next time though I will not put as many breadcrumbs and add more liquid to the soup.  Thanks for sharing."
280166,100005,2007-01-16,5,"We loved this chicken.  My kids ate it with ketchup, my husband and I enjoyed the lemony sauce (much like a picatta).  PS - The HEB grocery store in my neighborhood carries thin sliced chicken breast which speeds things up because no pounding required!"
2001654058,133474,2017-08-02,5,"There are other, more complicated recipes on the web but this simple recipe is spectacular. The taste and texture are perfect. I could only get my flour mixture to absorb 3 and a half cups of buttermilk and the drying time was only about 5 hours. I can't explain these differences... Things happen I guess. The final product was just right. The only real surprise for me was how good they are before the drying out process! Had no idea! Just wonderful with honey and/or preserves."
227024,128095,2009-09-13,3,"For all the 5-star reviews this rub got, I was expecting it to be outstanding, but it was just okay.  It made enough rub to cover the whole chicken, and smelled absolutely delicious while cooking, but it just didn't have enough salt in it, and I don't think the brown sugar in it complimented the chicken very well.  It was definitely the best smelling chicken I've ever cooked though! :) Thanks!"
319796,165653,2006-06-08,0,"These were superb, I used real crab meat though, but my family loved it"
52125,10958,2005-03-29,5,"I really love this recipe. These Scalloped Potatoes were wonderful tasting and quick and easy to prepare.
Thanks Bergy.... "
244064,57872,2007-07-04,5,A great dip.  My family inhaled it. The spicyness was perfect.  Next time I think I would use less mayo as it was a little sweet.  This will be a frequent visitor to special events in our life.
583809,296205,2011-04-13,4,"This was pretty good!  I made it wheat free by substituting rice for the pasta and corn starch for the flour.  It ""barely"" served 4... with two of those being children.  Next time I'll add more veggies.  Nice recipe!"
327600,31940,2009-07-10,5,"Awesome tuna/pasta salad!!!  I didn't have sweet pickles or fresh onion, so I just subbed 3/4 c. sweet relish and 2 T. dry, minced onion and it was wonderful.  Will definitely make this again!!"
587766,100003,2008-12-11,5,oh so good!  i had an idea to make this dish myself & came to recipezaar to see if anyone else had tried it....thanks to sue l i decided to make aioli instead of plain mayo...outstanding!!  haha...i just realized i used a sue l recipe!!  the sage aioli for Recipe #92939 went so great with the chicken & red pepper!!  i didnt use swiss but pepper jack & no avacado.  what a yummy sandwich!!
414666,27017,2007-04-07,3,a little overpowering..the original tomato salad involves the use of chickpeas...
785604,71933,2008-12-05,5,"I'm sold!  I will never wrap my spuds in foil again!  I have to admit that I rub them with the oil, sprinkle with kosher salt and put on a cookie sheet...I have a relatively new convection oven and am still slightly neurotic about getting the inside of it messy!  This is an awesome way to make potatoes.  Thanks so much-Amy"
96177,22453,2005-04-17,5,"Hey...we loved it! The taste was yummy!!! Ken and I love lots of veggies and meat, so next time, we'll cut the spaghetti  to 1/2 lb.  Now that I think of it, I did add a bit more flour to thicken the sauce, but other than than... it's a keeper. 
Maryanne"
937635,105726,2009-07-14,5,"Kittencal, this is The Best garlic bread I've ever had! I like the PP's comment about everyone thinking they're a good cook because of You - I feel the same way! I couldn't find any non-skinny and long French bread, so I got a loaf of foccacia bread from a local bakery and sliced it length-wise like a PP suggested, baking at 350 for 10 minutes and then on low broil for 1.5 minutes. I also used 3 larger cloves and one small clove of garlic. Magnificent! And I loved the color that the parsley added!"
448748,40463,2007-07-24,5,"I made this for a church function and the guest speaker only asked about one recipe (out of a looong table of food), ""Who made those adorable and delicious tiny penguins?""  Everyone asked about them and it gave me the perfect opportunity to spread the news about Zaar!"
574942,11923,2007-10-18,5,"My guests spent the night raving about this!  It's best right out of the pan, I've noticed--eaten as leftovers, the cayenne and mustard aren't really noticable and the vinegar taste grows.  But those are just quibbles--this is a GREAT recipe."
121840,166844,2006-08-01,5,All we can say is WOW. This was an excellent recipe for salmon.  The sauce was perfect.  We added a 1/4 tsp of Cheasapeake bay seafood seasoning for some tanginess.  This will be a favorite in our household.
131126,501174,2013-06-22,5,Delicious and each of the layered flavors were stellar. I thought the recipe was a creative use of contest ingredients! I enjoyed making my own candied ginger and thought that inclusion transformed the recipe into gourmet.  I used french bread and did use the fresh nutmeg.  The bread pudding was creamy. I&#039;ll definitely be making this again! Good luck in the contest!
11811,92904,2006-02-21,3,My family liked this one OK. A good use for leftover ham. we served it on little tiny potato rolls and the girls thought that was a lot of fun. It made a lot and we were able to stretch the leftovers to several lunches.
678059,229860,2007-12-06,5,Awesome scones!  It was difficult to cut the dough into even wedges; it kept falling apart and I didn't want to work the dough too much and make it tough.  I will make these again and again!
723989,281690,2008-07-30,5,"This is a keeper! I used the thin sliced chicken breasts, so I didn't need to pound them. The dressing is to die for! A big hit with my family. Thanks for sharing."
148903,138528,2006-07-15,5,"Nice salad, nice flavour....I added chopped ham."
2001938860,70912,2018-01-18,0,"Beef barley soup is my favorite soup. I usually eat Progresso Beef Barley 3 times a week. I was shopping and came across a box of Quaker Quick Barley. I googled, how to make beef barley soup with ground meat. I got this recipe and made it. It came out PERFECT. The taste was very favorable and hearty. Thank you."
95743,59054,2006-09-10,5,Awesome apple salad. Made no changes and won't next time either.  I'm delighted to have the leftovers in the frig.  
956276,31750,2012-07-03,5,"This recipe is simple and awesome!  The batter seemed way too thin at first, but they turned out great.  I just have to master the art of how much batter to put in my waffle iron...keep oozing out the sides!  Thanks, Elaine.;-)"
779699,369921,2009-11-20,5,"This was so easy and sooooo good. I subbed Lima beans for the fava beans, because I could not find them (and to be honest I am obsessed with lima beans). I love the use of the chicken broth here. It adds a whole different dimension. I subbed Cavender's Greek seasoning for the S&P and we ate the whole entire dish! I will be making these a lot! Thanks for posting! Made for Holiday Tag 2009!"
763360,167914,2010-03-23,5,"Excellent!  Kittencal, you never let me down.  Thank you!"
29813,89005,2005-02-17,3,"I thought it was good, I used mild green chilies and next time Iwill use the hot ones to give it more spice. "
1803533177,77971,2014-12-22,4,Very easy and tastes a bit like lemon bars without the pastry. My airbake cookie sheets took a little longer- 14 minutes to bake.
10896,9241,2001-07-30,4,"I used this on fresh, fresh salmon from Seattle and my non-fish liking friends loved it."
340141,194201,2006-11-27,4,"Delicious.  We had it as a side dish, but I think it would be better as the Chef noted to serve over pasta or maybe a jacket potato as the EVOO is rich.  Also, my garlic slices didn't really cook through as much as I would have liked.  Next time, I will add them half-way through the cooking of the first side of the mushrooms.  Thanks for some yummy mushrooms!"
1801841764,38298,2014-01-04,5,"This soup is a family favorite from Olive Garden and my son has been asking me for years to try and make it.. I never realized how EASY it is!  I made some modifications i.e. used chicken broth plus some boullion cubes, hot italian sausage and some red pepper flakes and went with the swiss chard.  a good loaf of warm italian &quot;everything&quot; bread with butter. MMMMM!    It is a very cold winter night here in Chicago and this supper was a WINNER!  Thanks so much for sharing! Cool"
2216672,110223,2012-03-20,5,I've used this recipe several times and love it. I don't add the potatoes though since I make this with potato pancackes. This is now my go to kielbasa recipe.
191169,131606,2005-07-30,0,"The recipe sounds good(though not for a low fat diet!)
I really enjoy your directions.
That's one of the fun parts of Zarr....."
422957,100958,2007-01-06,5,Awesome meal! My family and I loved it.  We are just starting to eat healthier and this was the perfect stepping stone. I would recomend this for a family meal or a dinner party .  Fantastic recipe Johnney delicious and nutritious thank-you.
313120,205057,2007-01-28,5,"Thanks for the great recipe, everyone loved it."
673444,170557,2009-03-18,4,"This was pretty good.  I find I can usually eat 2 or even 3 servings of most raw recipes, but 1 serving of this was fine for me, as this recipe makes 2 huge servings.  I was lazy and decided to use my food processor to grate the carrots, zucchini, and red bell pepper. I used dried herbs instead of fresh and the sauce was tasty.  I would make this again, though I don't know if I would be able to convince my boyfriend this is a meal."
551345,3594,2009-02-28,4,i really enjoyed this meal. i covered 1/2 the bell peppers with sliced swiss cheese before i baked and left the other 1/2 of them alone. what difference the cheese made! WOW. SUPER easy to make. alittle more tomatoe than my stomach can handle. but you know what.....so worth it.
628076,322994,2009-12-15,4,"These are like chocolate dipped balls of frosting - pretty tasty. Dh actually made them for his Christmas party exchange so that speaks to the ease of the recipe. On a lark I frosted one with melted dove milk chocolate and thought is was great. Next time I will add a bit more cream cheese for a bit more of a cheesecake flavor but tasty as written. Thanks
Oh and the shortening in the chocolate made me go ""hmmm"" but it is needed to make the chocolate smooth enough for dipping."
1567664,375578,2010-03-02,5,"YUMMY, perfectly crispy. Wonderful."
69904,121191,2005-05-21,5,"  I made this to share at my sister's birthday party and went home without any strawberries left!!  The maple is very subtle, I may add more next time, but the brown sugar on the strawberries is essential!!  Thanks KC_Cooker for an unusual, yet yummy new way to eat strawberries!"
56180,30762,2002-11-18,5,Loved all the spices.  Very good.
101376,141385,2006-08-12,4,"VERY tasty and easy to prepare!! 
My husband and I both really liked it!
Thanks for a great recipe!"
174096,382437,2010-05-30,5,"Very refreshing, especially on a hot day!  I used the orange juice, and we liked the added flavor.  Thanks for sharing!  ZWT6"
916455,75476,2009-10-15,5,"Absolutely delicious!!!! I just ate this for my lunch and I liked it much more than the original omelet! I've used 1 shredded carrot and 1/3 shredded lettuce, I add 1 tbsp of rice milk and omitted the cheese (intollerance). Amazing recipe, thank you so much for posting it!"
382071,168968,2008-02-14,5,Great tangy smoothie! I love buttermilk. I made it as directed omitting the coconut extract and adding some vanilla and Splenda. Made for 1-2-3 hit wonders.
60694,17207,2004-02-18,4,"This was very easy and good.  I followed the recipe exactly (right down to the Mitchell's Black Forest Ham!).  When I went to put the raisins in, I found that the shallots were not close to being done, so I put up the crockpot to high for the last hour.  When I took the ham out, the shallots were still not done, so I put the sauce in a small pot and simmered it while I was making the side dishes.  It was done in about 10 minutes.  It simmered down into an almost chutney-like consistency.  The sauce was not as sweet as I expected, and was very good.  I found when I had the sauce the next day, the clove flavour really dominated, so I would next time remove them before refridgerating it.  Nice recipe!"
158446,89818,2006-03-07,4,"This was a very quick and easy recipe and very tasty for a light lunch.  I seeded both the tomato and cucumber to prevent the salad from becoming watery, otherwise I followed it as submitted."
518106,18387,2007-06-20,5,"This is my all-time favorite recipe!  The flavors combine so well with the sage, cumin, and chili powder.  The sage is something I've started putting in a lot of my Mexican dishes and it just enhances the flavors so well!  This is a very, very rich-tasting recipe so watch out!  Yummy!  Thanks for posting and sharing!"
1835523,428672,2011-04-30,5,Results are good...but they should be as this is a King Arthur Flour recipe...let's jsut give full credfit where credit is due.
79737,17559,2004-02-17,4,"I brought a sample of this recipe to my parent's house. My mom had to sneak a bite right away. After sampling it she said, ""I sure hope that your father doesn't like this."" She immediately requested the recipe. My husband also really liked it. Personally, I thought it was too sweet, and I am not a huge fan of banana splits either, but others really enjoyed it. Otherwise, it was a very fast and easy recipe to prepare. Thanks for another great one Darlene!!!"
2002758,58093,2011-09-08,0,My husband likes evertything plain but he said that this one was a keeper!!  Yeah
2500615,282052,2012-11-14,5,"Thanks for the easy to follow recipe.  The first time I made it, the taste was great but my muffins had a weird look.  The next time, I added cocoa powder, coconut flakes and a few chocolate chips!  Wonderful!  Thanks again.  I will now continue to enjoy GF Buckwheat muffins on a regular basis."
203467,117915,2005-04-30,5,Awesome! I love the flavor of the sour cream sauce! I will definitely make this recipe again.
380162,87085,2009-02-21,2,This was just okay to me. It lacked any amazing qualities that would make me want to cook it again. :-S
107583,209794,2007-08-26,5,"Very tasty!  I used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Splenda, and subbed Craisins for raisins."
1195537,411097,2011-05-15,5,Delicious baked beans without any Pork!
201838,36015,2005-08-16,5,this was delicious! served it at a church function and people wanted the recipe- the icing is fantastic- couldn't find orange cake mix so i used yellow cake mix with the orange kool-aid (great idea!)
174991,60560,2006-01-20,5,"What a salad!!!!Left out the black beans, personal perference, but that didn't alter the greatness of this  salad.  Definately this will be on the make and take for the summer."
650938,19871,2008-11-04,5,Yay Yay Yay!  Both of my kids ate their first bowl and asked for seconds which rarely happens in my house.  And my BF and I both loved this too so THANK YOU!  I needed to add more broth to het my pasta cooked so next  time I might double the tomatoes.  Used bowtie pasta and it came out perfect in the end.
215057,103687,2006-09-10,3,"These cookies were very easy to make and tasted very good.  Make sure you have a tall glass of cold milk... yum...  Bdavis - Hudson, FL"
447487,493438,2013-07-26,5,"I made this salad a couple of days ago, first bowl was nice and refreshing though somewhat bland, leftovers sat for 2 days in the dressing. With &quot;marinating&quot; the sweet fruit, the salty feta and the tang of the lime all infused into the melons and and gave it a wonderful zing. Delicious ! Thanks for the recipe, Dienia ! Made during ZWT9 for team Tasty Testers :)"
722434,202891,2015-12-30,5,"These were the BEST muffins I have ever eaten.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The key is the lemon zest, so don&#039;t leave it out.  Eat them fresh from the oven.  Reheating them - in the oven or microwave - leaves them dry."
878238,286631,2008-09-07,5,"I used butter instead of shortening, cut the walnuts because I don't really like nuts in banana bread, and put it straight into the crock pot.  It was done after 3 hours on high and was fantastic.  I will make this again when I want some easy banana bread."
28177,284963,2008-05-14,5,"Yumm! What a fun way to eat carrots. Picky toddler DD & teen DS loved them too! Daddy didn't care too much for them though.  These were deliciously sweetened carrots with a slightly sticky sauce that was hard to resist eating right out of the pan! I had to make a couple substitutions that I don't think changed the final outcome too much. I didn't have fresh ginger (normally do, but have been out of state a lot lately), so I used homemade crystallized ginger & cut down the sugar to 1/2 T. instead. The ginger flavor was softened a bit & I know it'll really pop with fresh grated! I was sure I had golden raisins on hand but couldn't find them so used regular ones. I liked the color contrast between the dark raisins & the carrots, but next time will use golden & I think DH might try it again with those. Thanks so much for sharing, Kefuffle! Made in gratitude for encouraging my interest in photo taking."
2336422,460808,2012-07-22,5,"Great Results! I doubled up on the ingediedients to make 8 huge burgers. Also try smoking these babies, you wont be dissapointed. ;)<br/><br/>NB.  I Allowed mix to firm up in the fridge for an hour or 2 before building as it can be a bit wet. Also back in for a while once built."
1355226,159330,2009-08-17,4,"just made this for a cheescake topping and used the 2/3 of sugar and was still a little too sweet for me. but the flavor is great, great, great and didn't need any food coloring.
will definately make again but with less sugar!

thanks :)"
452355,25219,2007-12-31,5,"Really delicious, hearty breakfast dish.  DH and I enjoyed this and will be making it again.  Didn't change a thing.  Thanks for posting."
309581,107786,2007-09-03,5,"Excellent and easy for someone like me who needs help in the kitchen! Impossible to screw up because if it was, I would."
28177,8782,2006-04-08,5,"Wow!  This one was so incredibly tender & juicy; even the white meat!

I prepared the chicken for marinating (very quick & easy) & forgot that DH & I were having dinner the next night at our son's school auction.  The bird was in the fridge for two days total.  I don't think it hurt it any.  We were all tortured with the smell of it cooking, it was like Thanksgiving!  But every minute was worth it in the end.  The meat was falling off the bone &  we barely have enough leftovers for chicken salad sandwiches tomorrow.  I have been instructed to put this one in the keeper file.  Thanks!"
1100022,145580,2012-10-05,5,Yummy!
928782,78555,2012-01-15,5,"This is the second time I made this pie and both times we have loved it!  Like some other reviewers commented, it is a little ""soupy"" and runny when you serve it, so it isn't very pretty, but for my family it's all about the taste and this pie is amazing!  We used sweet apples (Gala) to contrast with the tart cranberries and it was perfect.  I would maybe try adding some cornstarch to the flour/cinnamon mixture and maybe dot the pie with butter before I top with the crisp, but you can't beat the flavor, so that's 5 stars in my household!!"
659924,6919,2010-07-19,5,"Simple to prepare, delicious, healthy, and minimal clean-up? JOY!!!<br/><br/>I made very minor deviations from the recipe: combo of butter and evoo; lime juice; dried parsley and dill, added some granulated garlic. (Can you tell it was hot and I didn't want to go to the market?) As others suggested, I put the oil/butter on first, then sprinkled on the other ingredients (just eyeballing amounts).<br/><br/>I put the packets on a cold gas grill, then turned it on high for 6 minutes, after which I turned off the heat but didn't open the cover for another 6 minutes. (No preheating and no turning the packets.) My 1/2-lb. swai fillets were done to perfection. The liquid from the packets was wonderful over brown jasmine rice."
140691,76887,2007-06-24,1,I believe this would taste much better with real cheddar cheese rather than Velveeta which I believe gave it an unpleasant aftertaste.  Also the author called for uncooked white rice which could never soften after standing just five minutes off the burner--it would taste like small pebbles.  I believe she meant to say instant (Minute) rice which is what I used.
93095,65877,2003-12-21,5,"This was quick, easy, and very tasty.  Just what I was looking for!  Thanks for the recipe!  "
388414,109233,2007-12-28,5,"add in some crushed pecans and it becomes Waffles of INSANE IN THE MEMBRANE Greatness.. Makes boxed waffle mixes taste like .... :P Aretha, Thank You.. Zusie-Q, Thank You.."
632585,402687,2010-12-31,5,"Because we were having so many treats, I cut the dough into 32 wedges for 'little bites'. Brought them to two different family events, and they were a hit! This recipe is a keeper for a Christmas treat. I researched some other Regelach recipes and used the suggestion to substitute marzipan instead of the almond paste, because the paste takes more effort to stir. The second batch I made I added a thin layer of strawberry jam .. although I should have just sprinkled cinnamon without the sugar on the inside .. they were a tad sweet. These would be equally tasty made with just a layer of jam instead of the toffee bits."
2679050,127709,2013-02-05,5,"I used this recipe for the first time in 2006 when I was living in Riga, Latvia for a year. I had a Christmas party for my Latvian colleagues, who had never had barbecue ribs. These were the hit of the evening. I go back to this recipe time after time, and it always gets the highest of praise. I wouldn't change a thing. Absolutely perfect. Thank you for posting it!"
678857,332727,2008-11-02,4,"My prep time was a little longer since I had no left over turkey so I cooked some chicken breasts while the carrots simmered.  The mixture (which tasted delicious) thickened but was not thick enough.  I assumed it would thicken more in the oven but instead it got soupier.  Next time I'll add a little more flour and make sure it is good and thick before turning into the casserole dish.  The crust was fantastic, Nice & flakey on top and oh, such good flavor.  Made for Fall 2008 PAC-O"
999056,196981,2008-10-22,5,Super yummy! Healthy! Fast and Easy! My Favorite Freezer recipe!
432743,63380,2008-07-27,5,What can I say but WOW. Had it with spaghetti and meatballs. Wouldn't change a thing. Very flavorable crusty bread. Thanks for the great recipe. A keeper.

895132,366114,2011-04-27,4,"Easy and tasty. Actually 3.5 stars - a bit too tangy for my taste. I added some dried tomatoes for DH which made the fourth star ;-) Thanks for posting, will make this again and play around with it a bit!<br/>Made for Healthy Choices ABC."

2815603,445692,2013-05-06,5,"This is the first time I have ever reviewed a recipe I have gotten online. I am doing this for two reasons. Number one I felt bad that the creator of this recipe had no reviews. And number two this recipe was worthy of a good review. My family loved this soup!!! It was very satisfying and comforting. Something we were looking on the chilly day we made it. Only one change was made and that is only because I try to limit pork in our diets. So I replaced the pancetta with turkey bacon. I encourage others to try this tomatoless recipe whether or not can or can not have tomatos. In the words of my youngest daughter, &quot;It was the BOMB!!!&quot; (Meaning it was wonderful). Thank you Gourmand."
2000839443,381129,2016-01-26,5,Can&#039;t even tell it&#039;s low sugar. Delicious.
29782,219784,2007-04-10,5,We really enjoyed this recipe. Our fillets were alittle thicker than usual so I had to bake ours longer than this recipe called for. I also replaced the garlic powder for minced garlic. I added minced garlic in the melted butter and dipped fillets than into the panko breading and poured the rest of butter/garlic over top of fillets in baking dish. I didn't have lemon juice so I added garlic lemon pepper to the breading. The fillets were crunchy and thats how we enjoy fish :)  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!
2232254,71313,2012-04-06,4,This is the first kugel of any kind that I have ever made. I used 1 1/2 cups diced caramelized onions and 1/2 c raw onion puree mixed with the eggs and oil. Then I grated 7 large peeled Yukon Gold potatoes on the small side of my cheese grater. Grate fast and squeeze dry and place directly in the egg so they don't turn brown. I did the starch and boiling water thing even though I was very dubious. Add salt and pepper and nuke about a tablespoon for 30sec to test for seasoning. Add more salt and pepper if needed. At this point I put the whole mix in the fridge overnight. I took it out about an hour before cooking and stirred it well. Then followed directions exactly for baking. It was done after 20min on 500F and 25min on 400F in my oven. I was told it was absolutely delicious and the tiny bit I got to taste was yummy. There wasn't a drop in the pan at the end of the night. So even though I thought the starch thing weird. It worked out very well.
2001426112,2886,2017-03-10,5,Just made this today instead of bread I made muffins out of the batter baked them for 20 mins I used 4 bananas as it said you could use my daughter took them to work and everyone loved them the best they ever had Thanks for Sharing this I will be making these for the rest of my family
1451716,25885,2013-10-31,2,Definitely not my style of banana bread.  It was more of a bread pudding consistency.
2607468,100604,2013-01-02,5,"In one word...WOW!! The entire family praised the dish during holiday meals.  The more cheese, the merrier :-)!!"
88099,38327,2007-08-19,5,Excellent French Bread.  Went together so easy.  I can't believe how quickly I had fresh made French Bread.  The flavor and texture were perfect.  Thanks
382071,158734,2006-12-26,4,"This is such a great idea! I used 1 pound of lean ground beef, grated carrot and 3 slices of sourdough bread crumbled into crumbs and everything else the same. They turned out very nice and moist and strongly tasting of oregano. My husband LOVED them, I would prefer less oregano so I can taste the other flavors. Thanks for the recipe! Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders."
2000350673,505862,2015-07-20,5,Wow this recipe was extra easy and quick me and my family did a 3 mile walk while the cooking went on
173105,261711,2011-01-05,4,"I made this with ground beef (cooked it, drained fat and then added back). After I completed the recipe as written, I decided it needed something to be more ""enchilada-like"" so i added about 8 ounces of sharp cheddar and about 8 ounces or so of velveeta block cheese. I also added a packet of ranch dressing mix. I liked it better this way and my family loved it. This recipe made quite a lot of soup!"
10404,423200,2010-06-25,5,"I too saw the show and had to make them!  I did use garden lettuce over spinach, used adobo sauce over the cayenne in the mayo, and added sprouts to ours!
Your directions are spot on, the sandwich excellent, and I'm thrilled I did not have to post it!
For people who like fish tacos this would be a fantastic option over the chicken.  
Great recipe, everything comes together while the pastry bakes and really, I'm adding thinly sliced marinated cucumbers to mine next time!  Maybe artichokes too now that I think about it!
Thanks so much for Posting!

98919,163949,2012-06-20,5,I just did an all out search for this recipe on the internet and I should have known it would have led me back to my favorite site!  This recipe has been around since I first got married in the mid-70's and one we always loved.  I too got it off the Crisco can.  I always made it in an electric skillet and made the extra spicy version.  Thanks so much posting.  I will have easy access to it now!
383346,457641,2011-06-24,5,I used fusilli pasta.  I didn't add salt because of DH.  We all enjoyed this recipe.  I thought DH would not like it as much because there is mayo in it but he liked it and gave it 5 stars.  This is very refreshing and I'll do it often.  Thanks Linky :)  Made for Count Dracula and His Hot Bites for ZWT7
953275,399373,2010-03-30,5,"Fantastic!  The batch didn't last, it was all enjoyed within minutes.  Such a simple recipe, don't be fooled, it's very tasty.  As the others did I threw the onion & spices in a little oil and sauteed before adding everything else in.  We're big lentil fans here, and my children really enjoyed this soup.  It definitely makes just enough for 3 people, or two hearty portions.  The only ingredient change I made was that I added a few cloves of minced garlic in.  Thanks 80's!  Made for Veg*n swap Apr10."
152393,107492,2006-11-24,5,"These are the perfect side dish for Thanksgiving!  Not only are they delicious, but they free up valuable oven space!  I also found these a little less sweet than our regular oven baked recipe...That is a GOOD thing!  Everyone loved them.  Thanks Lvs2Cook for giving me a new holiday favorite."
37636,71172,2008-12-07,5,Goes great with breadsticks or slices of freshly baked baguette. Perfect for teenagers or lovers of Italian food. Thanks for sharing! ~Sue
189280,22391,2012-01-31,5,"These onions are flavorful and crisp.  My mom used to marinate onions in red wine vinegar, so I used that.  Delicious!"
238496,149977,2007-09-21,5,"I was extremely pleased with this soup. I love that it is nutritious and low fat, but I am really impressed with it's flavor. I highly recommend this soup."
280271,460564,2013-03-04,4,Hubby and I enjoyed this delicious dish...he likes his steak on the rare side...me...I like it a little bit more cooked...but we both enjoyed the flavor of this recipe....thanks for posting it...=)
1739435,117211,2010-11-22,5,"This is a phenominal Baked Oatmeal Recipe.  First, I doubled this recipe but also added a large jar of Mussleman's Chunky Applesauce, Ripened Bananna chunks (not many because banannas tend to take over the flavor), you can also add the banannas along with your milk when you prepare it for your individual serving.  I used 5 eggs instead of the 4 to double.  <br/>It was absolutely delicious!!!!!!!  Had a lot left over for breakfast the next day, kept well overnight in the refrigerator.  It'll be a keeper."
111678,34245,2005-10-30,5,"I made this with roasted garlic, and I just loved it.  I make hummus a lot, and this is a really nice change.  If you love garlic and basil as much as I do, definitely try this!"
264017,30163,2008-04-16,5,"Great, healthy recipe! I usuallly bake my sweet potatoes in small chunks tossed in olive oil. This was a nice change and with less calories. Loved the foil tip to save on clean-up time! One additonal thing I did was sprinkle the ""fries"" with kosher salt rather than regular table salt. Thanks Shannon!

1139722,29441,2013-01-10,5,"Absolutely amazingly easy, quick, and very tasty tomato soup! This is JUST what I was looking for when I started searching for tomato bisque recipes!  I found a lot, too, on this site, but after reading 21 5 star positive reviews, I KNEW this was the ONE I had to try! Boy I am glad I did too! Went together very quick and easy. Used the stewed tomatoes and heavy whipping cream, part dried and part fresh basil (due to amount having on hand), and a TBLS of light brown sugar as most of the other posters mentioned to do!  Fantastic!  Will be making it over and over and over again when the craving of tomato soup hits. Hubby even said ""NO more canned tomato soup for us!""  Only thing I will do in the future, is use my hand blender and puree a bit, didn't care for the ""crunchy"" texture of some of the tomatoes. Probably was the brand I used, wasn't Del Monte, I've never noticed Del Monte to be ""crunchy""!! LOL  Thanks again, for such an awesomely easy recipe!!!"
58104,457234,2011-06-03,4,"Good stuff but I enjoy this with cachaca over gin in this drink, but good when out of it! I did muddled in a shaker glass then gave a good shake. Which is key to this drink. I did cut back on the sugar to half the amount.<br/>Part of Menu #66619 which we did taste tasting of the different versions of Caipirinha`s. Thanks!"
5060,130985,2005-09-23,5,"I used this relish with roasted chicken thighs, very nice addition to the chicken. Couldn't find nectarines, so I had to use peaches, they worked just fine. I used fresh grated ginger. What a great idea to use the potato pealer to peal the red pepper!! I'll be using that trick again. We enjoyed it very much it complimented the chicken, I think it might be good with fish also, maybe next time.  Thanks for sharing a keeper!"
1551041,102047,2010-02-13,5,"02/13/2010
This is fabulous. Omitted the capers ( brides suggestion ) and doubled the Lemon juice and added 1 teaspoon Dijon Mustard. Excellent on Grilled Salmon."
2315665,235869,2012-07-05,5,I have been making this recipe since 2008...wouldn't change anything about it. It is a HUGE hit everytime! 5-6 pounds does not cut it for a gathering. I usually buy between 9-10 pounds and it's still all gone. Adjust the ingredients accordingly if you buy a larger brisket. Here in Texas we have a small company that makes fantastic BBQ sauce (which I think just makes this recipe even better) called C.W.'s Sweet Sauce. If you like sweet BBQ sauce you will love it!
795588,281399,2008-04-01,4,"I made this recipe exactly as written with no deviations. This was a very tasty recipe, indeed. The hublet hates to get anything on his hands, but adores hot wings. He also loved the fact that he did not have to wrestle with the bones found in your standard variety hot wings. The flavor was good with a kick, but not so much that you ran for the fire hose to cool your throat. They were easy to make and served as a fantastic appetizer before dinner last night. The next time I make these, I will make my homemade blue cheese ranch dressing for dipping and will cook the chicken in the oven to avoid the frying oil."
58104,243431,2007-08-24,4,"This was fantastic. The sauce tasted yummy cold as well warmed Just could have had less mustard for it was a bit overpowering. I used sock eye salmon. The wine did all evaporate by the time it was done cooking. My fillet had skin so it was removed from the pan with ease. But I do suggest to lightly spray or oil the pan or even lay the fillet on a bed of lemon slices and herbs before baking. 
I served this on a bed of romaine. Thanks for a great recipe."
2001429023,336374,2017-03-11,5,Decadent and heavenly. Best chocolate pound cake I've ever tasted. Needed to bake longer than 1 hr 15 min. I left mine in an extra 15 min.
265694,23687,2008-01-05,5,sorry so late to rate.  this was awesome! left my turkey breast so moist and full of flavor.  will definetely use this again
49304,111533,2005-02-27,5,"Delicious, What a yummy Pancake. Made it just like the recipe said, used 2 golden delicious apple. This is easy to make, I will be making this again & again, DH loved it. Marie, thank you for another delicious recipe."
34390,364736,2012-01-25,4,Flavorful! I would use 2-3 times the amount of sauce... it's yummy!
38182,50004,2005-10-21,5,I tried these last night! We loved them and put them over hot dog buns with a squirt of yellow mustard over the top! So easy and the few leftovers are even better.
131126,126653,2006-07-16,5,Very flavorful and a terrific rub to put into holiday gift baskets!  Thank you for sharing your recipe! 
17803,485233,2012-08-25,5,This was the first time that I've tried the  garam masala and I enjoyed it very much.  I made this for Zaar World Tour 8 for the Bistro Babes team

199839,179776,2007-03-16,5,YUMMY LEMONY GOODNESS!! THis was soo simple to maje and very tasty! Will Make again
830503,57225,2008-05-01,5,"Foolproof!  I made the recipe as written (with the addition of extra baking powder - 1/2t - on advice of previous reviewers).  After I poured the batter in the pan, I realized I had not added the sugar.  I went ahead and just added the brown sugar and restirred the batter.  Even at my 7000 ft elevation, the bread came out very light and moist.  A great recipe!!"
432201,69243,2007-03-06,5,This recipe was great. My kids loved it. I used regular paprika 'cause that's what I had in house. Worked well.
180928,103714,2004-12-28,5,"This is my family's and extended family's new favorite fish dish. I made it with Gruyere cheese and baked at 400 Farenheit for 15 minutes, then broiled on Hi for another 5-7 minutes. It's quick, easy, and everyone loved it."
764128,365083,2010-01-23,5,"Great, fast rolls! I wanted yeast rolls for dinner, but only had about 45 min before serving. This fit in perfectly. I whipped up the batter in the food processor, by mixing the yeast into the dry ingredients and then used hot water from the tap with the other wet ingredients. I increased the sugar to 3 tblsp, just because I wanted sweeter rolls. I let it sit for 15 min in the food processor, then spooned batter into muffin tin, let rise again and baked as instructed. Yummy!"
197023,151164,2006-01-25,5,"This is such a fabulous way to cook chicken and SO easy. It's quick enough to for a quick midweek meal and and elegant enough to serve at a dinner party. Except for adding some minced garlic in step 8, I made this exactly to the recipe. I used Granny Smith apples which I left unpeeled. Everyone loved the blend of flavours. I'll be making this again. Thank you for sharing this scrumptious recipe, LAURIE!

"
41578,62968,2003-07-01,5,"We really enjoyed this dish.  Quick and easy to make too!  Since I only had one lemon on hand, I used it and cut back the olive oil to about a tablespoon.  I love it when I find a dish where I can use fresh herbs from my garden, and the fresh basil was perfect!  Thank you for a great tasting dish, KitchenManiac!!  :-)

229850,70646,2005-12-08,5,"Hands down the best upside down cake I have ever tasted! Can't wait to try it with can peaches for a peach upside down cake! Thanks for improving a desert, that was already a fav and making it delicious."
865936,455085,2014-04-21,4,"This makes a nice appetizer, although I am a little weirded out about putting sugar in refried beans. I guess it could be a dessert if you put sugar on it."
682964,146414,2007-12-15,5,Wow!  These were so good and really do melt in your mouth.  I brought some into my husbands work and all the guys approved.

1412781,156830,2009-10-12,4,"Fantastic addition to the holiday dinner, substituted dried Cranberry for the Cherry

Like a bit more curry next time."
362983,243690,2009-02-10,5,"I was really looking forward to making this recipe.. and then I found out all my mushrooms went bad! I already made the dressing though so I made some quick croutons and had myself a simple more traditional caesar salad instead. It was delicious! So I can't vouch for the salad and mushrooms together (though of course I'm sure it'd be just as or even more wonderful) but the dressing is great. The only thing I'd probably do differently next time though is cut down the lemon juice just a tad since I think I'd rather have my dressing a little less citrusy for a caesar salad. I also ended up using sardines since I didn't have anchovies, so I'll have to try it with anchovies next time around (and the mushrooms as well!) Great quick and easy recipe. Thanks!"
37779,132645,2006-02-24,5,"I love chicken salad and eat it a lot for lunch. My husband and I both thought this one was excellent. The fresh rosemary and smoked almonds are what make this one unique and are key ingredients. Like ncmysteryshopper, I was afraid I wouldn't like the yogurt but found I couldn't taste it at all (which is good because I don't really like it). I used a crusty wheat bread to make sandwiches for our take-to-work lunch. This was very enjoyable, healthy, and quite filling. Thanks for posting it, KelBel. "
124050,48346,2004-02-02,4,"This is a great recipe and the cake does really come out quit gooey, but it is delicious"
37449,9984,2008-06-08,4,"I enjoyed this for something different! It was a little sweet, so I added water like you suggested. Thanks!"
210010,108594,2006-06-11,5,This was very close to the original! Like some of the other reviewers I also made some modifications. I added extra cilantro and used 3 cloves of garlic. I went easy on the (1 Cup) but I could have used the whole 1-1/2. Since I cut my jalapeno in half to grill and dropped one of the halves in the grill my salsa was a bit mild. All I had was cayenne pepper so I gave it a shot and it added a little flavor. Iâm going to play around with this recipe until I get it as close as possible.  Thanks so much for posting this!!!
355694,331217,2009-11-29,5,I'd been looking for a recipe similar to the one my mother used to make. This one seemed very close so I used it to make rolls for our Thanksgiving dinner. It was very easy to prepare and rose beautifully. The rolls turned out nicely but next time I'll add more salt and probably a little more sugar as well. Thanks for giving me a recipe to use that is so close to the one mother made for years.
29196,454028,2012-01-31,4,"I made this tonight for the two of us. I used ALL the liquid, three small sprigs of rosemary, two teaspoons of dried oregano (2 tablespoons would be a huge amount) and 4 cloves of garlic. In my opinion, that would be more than enough seasoning even with 8 shanks. Once the foil came off, the liquid almost reduced to nothing-it would have been hard to get enough to serve over the full amount of shanks. Never mind, this was absolutely delcious and we both loved it thanks Pat."
199971,19042,2006-09-13,5,"I've made these for potlucks at work a number of times.  I've used chopped chives in place of the onions and grated cheddar in place of the parmesan, and they're great that way also!  They're also one of the first things to go!"
35701,50726,2004-02-22,5,"Oh my goodness, is this good.  I had 1 pound of scallops and 1 pound shrimp that were slated for chowder, but we just weren't in a chowder mood.  So this was the perfect recipe for them!  Made exactly as stated, but I used 5-6 cloves garlic, what can I say? lol, love that garlic!  We also added a couple tbsp butter to the finished sauce. Then I threw the cooked seafood back in to toss with the sauce, and then spooned them over the pasta.  Served over thin linguine.  Cher, this was fabulous!  Thank you!"
1922930,169758,2011-06-02,3,"The dough recipe is standard, and it's good in texture.  Though I would recommend boiling them for one minute per side.  I am not quite sure why this recipe has received such high ratings, but I imagine it is because most of these are first-time bagel bakers.  I have made bagels in the past using different recipes, and I have to say this is my least favorite.  It's not bad.  Again, as a recipe for bagel dough, it's perfect.  But the topping situation doesn't work.  The egg wash turns a dark brown and doesn't look (or taste) very appetizing.  Not to mention, I found that because the bagels were hot from the oven, the egg wash dried almost immediately and none of the toppings would stick.  Then when I toasted the bagels, the egg wash chipped off with all the toppings.  I'd recommend another method for toppings, which is to have a bowl with all the toppings in it, and when you take the bagel from the boiling water, immediately drop them in the bowl, then take them out.  It works much better.  I also prefer to set the wet bagels on a drying rack before putting them on the cookie sheet, but it's probably not necessary.  Overall, this recipe is good, but with modifications."
9579,59772,2009-09-17,5,This is so easy to make and I liked that it didn't have vinegar in it. I was looking for a sauce for a Rib Cookoff and out of the eleven that I made my husband said this was the winner. Thanks for the recipe.
182010,99948,2005-07-10,5,"An excellent condiment--the liquid is a cross between a syrup and a sauce, the onions retain some crispness and the flavor is terrific.  I can't wait to serve some of this with grilled lamb.  Thanks, Bobtail!"
508148,105616,2009-05-05,5,These are very good and such a nice change of pace from the usual sandwich fare!  Had this with soup for dinner Recipe #42863  Love ToH recipes!
35526,74301,2005-03-30,5,"While pimping this I realized I never reviewed, ooops!!  Great little Appy or snack.  We serve at every single party we have had in the last 2 years.  Salsa, sour cream and quacamole on the side.  FANTASTIC!!"
1677154,60816,2012-05-18,5,works great
1720147,4667,2012-06-27,5,"Absolutely delicious! I used almond milk and added a splash of vanilla creamer as well as a dash of nutmeg and cloves. They came out great, I let the bread sit in the mixture and absorb it fully because it was really moist when I cooked them in the skillet. Will definitely make again when I have a French toast craving."
126440,109393,2010-05-18,4,Good but a little bland.  Cooked them on the KJ after chilling for over four hours.
648351,78263,2008-01-05,5,"This is really a good cake.  I made it 2wks ago and the outcome was, ""Oh, My God! Girl, I didn't need my husband after I had that cake.""  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definitely make again."
68526,81858,2007-08-20,5,"These are always a treat! Try adding some chopped peanuts, pecans, or walnuts, and some coconut to the mix... YUM!"
380162,67426,2009-01-26,3,"This recipe wasn't too bad, but it waasn't too great either for my husband and I. It was just okay, I think I'll try other casserole recipes before I come back to this one."
169128,41009,2005-02-13,5,I have made this twice now. Simply fantastic. Instant favorite. Thanks.
1270609,444077,2010-12-16,0,"These are wonderful and very easy to make!  Had to fight off the family in order to save them for the gifts they were intended to be.  Can see this is going to be a ""Make 1 batch for family and 1 for gifts"" kind of recipe in the future!!  BTW, I did NOT do the peppermint kisses on top - they were delicious as ""just"" cookies.  I'm now making a batch with dark chocolate chips in them by request to see how that works as an ""alternate"" recipe."
1055399,103085,2008-12-05,5,The best peanut butter cookies my family ever tasted - hands down. Glad I made as many as the recipe suggested; I simply freezed half of the batter for another time.
383346,270260,2012-10-02,5,Great recipe.  The chicken turned out perfect.  The meat fell off the bone.  Great taste.  Thanks WV Mermaid.  Made for I Recommend tag game
567959,74050,2009-05-11,5,"Very easy and VERY delicious! I needed to use some miscellaneous ingredients around the house, and out of curiosity I thought I'd add a few more... I used FF condensed milk (all I had) and added 1/2c of oatmeal and 1/8c wheat germ to make it a little less guilty ;). I also added about 3oz of low fat cream cheese to use it up. These turned out sooo good! I skipped greasing the pan and baked for 30 minutes as instructed. Thank you!"
255338,30653,2006-10-13,5,"To make it more attractive to my kids, I added some shrimps which gave it a little colour. Also, Indonesians use a lot of shallots, so I used that instead of the onions for a more authentic and fragrant taste. Very tasty recipe. Thank you for posting."
68942,33980,2003-03-22,5,What an appropriate name for this drink. Relaxing in front of the fire is exactly how we enjoyed it. We loved the flavor of cinnamon and coffee. Topped with whipped cream made it rich too. Thanks for a yummy hot drink recipe.
226863,376689,2009-06-21,5,"This is alot like the regular french toast I make, but with the addition of the flavored creamer.  It has made me want to go back and look at the creamer shelf again for more ideas!  Very good french toast!  Made for Newest Zaar Tag."
227456,177558,2008-09-08,5,Awesome!!!!!  I will never boil corn again and have silk all over the place.  I followed the instructions exactly and it was perfect.  Thanks!
171790,204740,2008-04-09,4,I love green beans and this is a wonderful way to serve them. I used a bit more zest than called for. Next time I'll leave out the parsley.
386585,331214,2009-05-03,5,"This was delightful and very easy.  I could not find the crab/shrimp combo, so I had to use a can each of the crab and shrimp.  I also sauteed the onion in some canola oil first (rather than use the spray - I guess I should be more calorie-conscious).  I did not find this chowder too thin, but I could easily use a spoon!  I will be making this again.  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game."
323389,36944,2007-02-04,5,This smelled so yummy while it simmered on the stove.  My chicken is wonderfully moist!  What I didn't use today I put in the freezer (two breasts and half the broth per container).  Next time I will make a bigger batch to freeze!
424680,387011,2011-07-10,5,"I'm sorry, but after growing up on canned peas, I have no such thing in my pantry & really don't want 'em, so I stuck with the frozen ones (at least this first time around, although now that I've ready your intro, my curiosity will probably get the better of me, & I'll have to TRY it with the canned stuff)! Anyway, we loved this salad ~ Easy to make & very easy to enjoy! Will be making it again, for sure! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Made & reviewed as a THANK YOU for playing with us in Please Review My Recipe during the recent tour]"
391355,60085,2010-05-08,5,"AMAZING!  I'm not a big meat-eater, but these make me want to be."
53123,20387,2007-01-29,5,"I too, made 1/2 the recipe. The flavor was outstanding. Very butterscotchy( if that is a word!) The only problem I had, was the batter was very thick. I had to wet my hands to press the batter into the pan. Once I got passed that, everything was fine. I only had to bake them 20 min, but then I made half. I used chopped pecans, but think I might try walnuts next time. Will for sure make this again, these are very chewy type brownies.DH took some to work for coffee break, so I am sure these would do well in a lunch box. Thanks Caryn!"
50969,81211,2009-01-14,5,"I was looking for a very easy french bread recipe and came across this one and decided to try it. And I'm so glad I did :) Since I didn't need two loaves of bread, the recipe was cut in half.And instead of making a loaf,the dough was divided into four pieces and rolls were formed.They rose perfect in the amount of time stated in the recipe.The taste was just what you would expect from french bread, crusty on the outside, and chewy on the inside. Thank you so much for posting a wonderful recipe. This will be made again, and ""Keep Smiling :)"""
199657,3608,2007-05-07,4,"I was looking for a healthier/lower sugar dessert for a friend.  
I used some bizarre Eastern European 'bosc'-ish pears and they worked okay.  
In the 3 or 4 hours between making them (and straining them from their poaching liquid and putting them in a bowl with a lid and leaving them at room temperature) and then finally serving them, they oxidized a bit and took on an very, very light grey-brown hue, but that could be that I just didn't poach them long enough or that my pears were not as suitable for poaching as other varieties. I waited to pour the poaching syrup over them, so maybe that was the problem.  It was my first poached pear voyage, so I'm pretty satisfied."
33443,121779,2005-05-16,5,"I served this with my steak, and it was a hit. I do not have canola oil, so i used evoo. I just spooned it around the steak, on the plate and it was delicious with evry bite."
679953,462323,2013-04-20,5,"Made these as written, used some McCormick steak seasoning, and a dash of pepper.  Very easy flipping on the barbecue, and ended up nice and crisp.  Served these with recipe#470504#470504.  Tagged and made in Holiday Tag."
819788,184812,2011-09-02,5,"I really love this recipe.  I used to think my pizza dough was good, until I tried this!  Thanks"
368044,52488,2006-10-24,4,"This dish is absolutely delicious.  It tastes just like or better than the restaurant's.  Very time consuming; frying is always messy.  Next time I will saute chicken, instead of frying.  A very good recipe and worth making!"
29404,108105,2009-03-16,5,"SO GOOD.  I did exactly as posted.  What a taste pleasure.  I served it with one of Knorr Side dishes, their Thai Sesame Noodles and cucumber salad made with red onions, mayo and sour cream, splash of same vinegar used in chicken.  DH ate all of his and about 1/3 of mine.  I could have easily sat and picked and picked, but I was ""tummy full"" despite  my mouth wanting more.  He says this is a definite do-again,  I agree.   Thanks so much for posting."
610013,50194,2008-02-07,5,"This was fantastic. I'm very new at cooking in general, and I found this recipe and fell in love. It's SO easy... and SO great! I added a bit more cheese than was suggested, and it turned out absolutely fine! I like a lot of cheese! Thank you for this recipe!! :)"
1803036560,123602,2014-08-16,5,amazing!! made for my diabetic grandma&#039;s birthday!! simple and great!
102859,59553,2003-11-13,5,"I have been doing the low carb thing on and off since 1999 so these 'fauxtatoes' are not new to me. This is a wonderful recipe! My family will not eat the real things anymore. Hints-use a 2 oz.chunk of cream cheese versus the sour cream to make them less watery, and an immersion blender works great for pureeing into glorious peaks of white. I especially like these served with Mille's Boston Market Meat Loaf-#28927. MMMMM good."
81897,12369,2004-09-11,5,"Thanks for the great speedy recipe, Jeanl. It was awesome, but mine was bubbly in one hour and perfectly done. I added a l4 oz. package of frozen broccoli(thawed)to the chicen and sauce layer  and it was a perfect one dish meal. Will be making this a lot in winter months for the comfort and easy versitility. "
384041,137040,2007-03-20,5,"The only difference between this recipe and the one I make is that I don't put sugar in mine.

It is fabulous. Especially on strong-tasting greens like spinach, escarole, or curly endive. Mmmmmm!"
1696314,141601,2011-10-11,0,"I turned it into a cake, and therefore had to adjust the cooking time, but it was GREAT!! Loved by all :)"
29782,87176,2005-02-18,5,"A ""Hot Chocolates Dream""!! should be the name for this wonderful rich hot chocolate.
If you love hot chocolate your gonna love this recipe. 
Very good and real simple to make for a quick warmer upper. lol
Thanks for sharing this good hot chocolate. "
297705,230397,2009-08-24,5,"Made a double batch of these without any optional add ins, flavourings or toppings. I accidentally added 1 tablespoon of cream of tartar (I keep it in the same type of jar as my baking powder and didn't catch my error until I'd already added it to the dry ingredients). Still the scones turned out really tasty and with a lovely texture. Served them at a tea party along with butter, cheese slices and a few jars of jam. All the guests really enjoyed them. Thanks, Debber. I'll be making these again."
13483,29276,2005-08-19,3,"Maybe my honeydew melon was too old or not ripe enough or something, but this just did not generate any real flavour for me.  I added some vodka but it just didn't do it for me. Maybe gin would have been a better addition??  Hopefully others will like it."
576273,229517,2011-12-27,5,super yummy! will keep in my conglomoration of recipes to make with kiddos! thanks bunches!
102672,54720,2009-10-09,5,We looooved this!  I used only ground beef and about 2 lbs of it and used chicken broth instead of the turkey drippings.  I also used onion powder instead of onions.  So delicious and I'm already thinking about when I'll make it again as I type... Mmmm!
421927,190906,2007-01-03,5,"(Five Stars) 

This is the first gluten-free bread that I honestly cannot tell from the wheat-based ones.  I'm not kidding.  It has that soft squishy texture that we all remember - you can make a real sandwich with this bread or just eat a warm slice with butter.

I used a combination of sorghum and superfine brown rice flours for my gluten-free flour blend because I didn't have any garfava flour - it's a very forgiving recipe!

Thank you thank you Laurie!  Our family thanks you for this fantastic recipe!

1058097,456991,2011-05-31,4,"This rice will never be the star of the show, but works just fine as a supporting player. It's good as a foil for highly spiced meat or poultry dishes.  Thanks for posting!  Made for ZWT Witchin Kitchen."
110034,98896,2004-10-10,4,I really liked these; they only took a minute to prepare and had a lovely flavor.  The only change I will make next time is to spread the potatoes out farther on a cookie sheet rather than put them in a baking dish.  I think they will crisp up a bit more quickly that way.  Thanks for sharing this easy but elegant-tasting side.
1404030,103057,2011-09-07,5,"This makes an great lazy weekend meal - 5-10 minutes of prep, then go watch a Netflix or Redbox movie while the gizzards simmer into a state of tender, tasty awesomeness.  I always use at least three pounds of gizzards these days, since they tend to disappear quickly.  Thanks so much for posting!"
2000265405,522053,2015-06-12,5,Really easy to make... and so tasty too.  I tend to look at these recipes and decide weather to make slight changes if I don&#039;t have all the ingredients.  So I changed the fenugreek leaves for powder (two teaspoons) Used a garlic Dolmio and a half cup of orange juice instead of water to wet the sauce.  Finally added about a dozen button mushrooms.  Delicious! :)
22724,276458,2008-04-24,5,"I have every intention of making this recipe as is, but I must confess my first try at it was altered to create a main dish for my ""must have meat"" family.  What I did was brown some ground chuck and then seasoned it with some tomato sauce mixed with 1 pkg of dry taco seasoning mix.  Other than that I followed your recipe word for word.    I am not sure what you would call it, but I lucked out and everybody loved it!  We talked about making burritos or mexican lasagna out of it next time.  With that being said, I am going to make the dish just as intended as a side dish to go with a grilled flank steak.  I can't wait to try it as intended!  Thanks for the great recipe!   :)"
58104,108473,2005-11-30,4,The Aroma that fills your home is Heavenly! I did need to additional sweetener! As for so much cinnamon tended to make it bitter. I`m sure that the cinnamon can be cut by 1/2. This is warming and relaxing. A great way to lower your blood pressure. The addition of toasted pine nuts seems to mellow the bitterness as well. Skipped the walnuts. Thanks for a new taste experience. Apple juice in place of the water would be great! Thanks!
383346,334586,2013-07-02,5,This is a great salad.  I used cucumbers instead of zucchini.  The dressing is yummy with all these veggies.  I forgot to add the croutons.  But anyway DH doesn&#039;t care for croutons.  I omitted the almonds and sesame seeds.  Thanks Diner :)  Made for Holiday tag game
173579,83741,2006-06-23,4,My DH really liked these potatoes.  I wasn't hardly as fond of them as he was.  He loves sour cream.  I'm sure I will be making these again soon.  Thanks for posting.
2000498330,78954,2017-09-10,5,Amazing flavored sauce and ridiculously easy. Brilliant.
66847,53649,2003-04-11,5,Tastes like you died and went to garlic and cheese heaven!
5060,211604,2007-03-17,5,"YUM this is a winner! very easy to put together, freezeable, and delicious too! I used the crisp bacon but will try the ham next time, also just used one jalepeno but will use the second one next time. We had them for supper tonight served with salsa and a light salad. I'm sure made into small ones they would make a great appetizer! We loved the flavours of the filling and I sure will be making them again! Good Luck in the contest!"
58407,88916,2008-02-01,5,"My kind of breakfast sandwich! I've been on an extremely low fat diet, but tried this last weekend because I was craving bacon, eggs and English muffins. Now, it's back to low fat and the treadmill, but I sure did enjoy it while it lasted!!!"
22015,153159,2007-02-24,5,Excellent flavors!   I loved the mixture and this was so quick and easy that I'll be keeping it around.
25455,25435,2003-01-21,5,Very moist and tasty with just the right crunchiness to coating.  Especially liked the fact that I could prepare it in advance and have it ready to pop in oven later in day.  Excellent--I would highly recommend this for an easy chicken main dish!
837995,7798,2009-02-13,5,"My friend and I enjoyed this so much!  I loved the blend of spices and we both think it is well deserving of the 5 stars we gave it, and would give it more if we could!  Just what I was looking for!"
124249,53758,2006-07-15,5,"We enjoyed these easy and tasty eggs. We also topped ours with some guacamole along with the cheese and salsa.

Thanks beckas.
Bullwinkle."
400708,148225,2014-12-02,5,"Simple, without a lot of fancy ingredients made for a moist and flavorful turkey.  We had a 22 pound turkey and after brining 24 hours, smoked on the smoker and the results couldn&#039;t have been better."
68950,158279,2009-01-02,4,"We really liked this, as we eats lots of tilapia!  Thanks"
337301,27648,2007-08-14,5,"This is an excellent way of serving asparagus, which is one of my favorite vegetables.  I made it as directed (with balsamic vinegar), except that I added the bocconcini to the asparagus while it was in the pan to make sure it melted and then carefully moved it to a serving dish.  So good!"
94000,313176,2011-01-27,5,"I made the recipe for my husband, who is Punjabi, but I have never personally tasted it before.  I thought it tasted very good!  Having said that, he liked it too, but then asked me to add in some pre-mixed masala to accomodate his unusually spicy tastebuds.  I would definitely make this again and recommend it for others to try."
900878,350894,2009-02-07,5,This was an easy soup to make. I used V-8 and used 3 cups total. I didn't feel it was too thick. Also made the croutons suggested. Perfect!
50555,32982,2003-03-14,5,Sitting home alone on a Friday night and I wanted something a litle more exciting than grilled cheese!   This was it!!!  So simple and fast and SO DELISH!!  I added a chopped up roasted red pepper (from a jar) and it was great.  Thanks for a recipe I will make again and again.
789516,139170,2009-04-03,5,This was yummy!  I skipped the cilantro because we don't like it and use parsley instead.  Also I left out the celery.  Next time I will add a bit more jalapeno..  This is going to be even better tomorrow!
1527317,347241,2010-05-30,5,"This potato salad is the bomb!   I used dried shallots instead of green onions, and carrots instead of celery.   I never really cared for potato salad but this one changed my mind!"
56306,46877,2003-01-04,5,Pure and simple perfection!!! I did recipe as written and these cookies were wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing.
65720,98052,2004-09-13,5,"This is an EXCELLENT marinade for fish! I used it for trout the first time and then with halibut, both with equally delicious results! I used one large garlic clove, fresh lemon thyme from the yard and lime juice with the trout and lemon juice ( was out of limes ) with the halibut. The marinade compliments the fish beautifully and doesn't overwhelm the delicate fish flavor. Thanks for my new favorite fish marinade- it'e definitely a keper!"
280271,345876,2010-02-28,4,These were very tasty potatoes. I used minced garlic and due to the ingredient list I didn't pick up a lemon at the store because I had lemon juice at home. So no lemon zest was added. I did give them a splash of juice. Thanks for posting. :)
27643,36486,2002-08-19,5,"It's hard to leave these alone! Very easy to make and simply devine!! The flavors all come together very nicely. I will make these again! Thanks, Diggy!"
1249468,84703,2012-10-25,5,"I liked this dish a lot, a real keeper for meatless Mondays. Not only is it easy to put together, but you can really class it up depending on the quality of the alfredo sauce you decide to use, or it can be quite economical for coupon moms like me who stockpile jars of Ragu and boxes of macaroni bought on sale.I love a dish with that kid of versatility, and tasty too!"
464887,21551,2007-07-18,4,"This is a great recipe.  It's very easy and quick.  The next time, I'll reduce the sugar by 25% in both the batter and the peaches to suit our preferences."
348934,33671,2014-01-28,5,"Made this for dinner tonight and was very well received by my family.  I put  2 tsp. of salt, but maybe for our taste, 3 would be better if the 4 is a bit too much.  I used the cooking liquid that was with left with the onions for a delicious couscous side dish.  I finely chopped the onions and added some fresh cilantro when i added the dry couscous to the cooking liquid.  There were some leftovers too, so chicken salad will be in our future.  Thank You Kathy for a easy and delicious recipe."
1663799,27740,2014-04-29,4,Made this tonight for dinner.. had some pretzel chips and thought this sounded very delish... the mustard sauce is delish and so reserve some for dipping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for posting
55015,240803,2009-10-23,5,"I have never cared much for waffles, but these were GREAT! I used whole milk and they turned out so light and fluffly! My kids, 2 & 3 years old stuffed themselves!!! THANK YOU this will definitly be a regular in my kitchen!"
60992,76299,2004-05-30,4,"This was interesting, I added the suggested red pepper flakes for added zip! I loved the color of the sauce, and the texture when first cooked (it did not reheat all that well), but I felt it lacked something, even though everything is right there. I think perhaps next time I make this I will use Italian sausage instead of the ground beef. I did serve this over vermecelli with fresh parmesan and garlic bread. It was very easy to put together and is great for a week night meal."
228919,97573,2006-01-28,4,"This recipe was great.  I doubled the spices because I like my food very flavorful.  Other than that this is a perfect dish. I make a lot of Indian food so I know the differences. Also, it's very easy to make!!"
427184,113385,2007-12-09,5,"I liked this a lot. Initially I thought it was a tad watery, but after I added the salt and white pepper it was very good. I paired with a piece of rye toast, and also made this as a 'heartier' soup only pureeing half of the vegetables. 
Thanks for a such a great, healthy low fat dinner."
37449,44832,2002-11-15,5,"Carol, these were absolutely delicious! My husband is a mashed potato fanatic, and he just raved over these! I will definately be making these again!  I did only use 2 cloves garlic cause DH told me he doesn't like garlic. He doesn't even realize I use it all the time! Thanks for a keeper!"
101153,8603,2010-04-30,5,"I've never made muffins before, so thought this looked easy and good to try. I added some mini chocolate chips and they turned out fabulous!! Thanks for making my 1st muffin experience a good one"
118684,325788,2009-03-21,5,My mom passed on this recipe to me from Martha Stewart and boy are they good! My son has requested them for his birthday! He'll be 6 and loves them!
485577,95032,2007-04-17,5,Made this last minute because the kids woke up sick and I knew the day would spin crazy. I did not have any mushrooms and I added a little extra honey.  It was delicious and so tender. Everyone liked it and I loved how there was so much juice to cover our brown rice.  Served it with whole green beans.  The sick kids enjoyed the leftovers.
245429,141315,2006-12-23,5,"We liked this version of split pea soup.  I used heavy cream instead of the light cream and I omitted the milk altogether because we like our soup thick.  I also added quite a bit of salt and alot of pepper to give it more flavor.  An extra special way to serve it is to put a dollop of sour cream on top and stir it in.  It adds an extra special richness to it.  Try it, you'll like it!!!"
272963,63557,2007-12-21,4,"something very like this was in every bakery or coffeeshop in sofia, bulgaria when i was in europe. i love them. only theirs are rolled in coconut, which i have tried to do as well with mixed results. i also use almond extract instead of rum which really makes them good. if anyone knows the bulgarian version, id love a recipe or at least a name!"
562524,83583,2008-08-25,5,I tried this today and it was wonderful.  I used liquid hickory smoke also and left out the cooking oil in the sauce.  We have dietary restrictions.  We definitely will have it again.I put the onion under the chicken (skinless).  Thank you!!!!!
421916,51184,2008-08-03,4,"Thank you!! Finally, something to use up the vanilla vodka that has been sitting in my kitchen forever.  And it's pretty tasty as well:).  I'll probably make this one again."
209255,100315,2006-12-11,5,Fantastic!  This was one of the first things I ever canned and it turned out beautifully!  I am so proud!  I can't wait to share this with everyone on my Christmas list.  Thanks for this!
761874,22361,2010-10-25,5,Wonderful stew! I put mine in the crock pot with frozen veggies. It cooks all day and is great. I wait until the end to add the vinegar and sugar as others have suggested. I probably only add about half the suggested sugar and vinegar. Thanks for the great recipe!
2115415,80470,2011-12-23,2,"These cookies were just OK.  No need to add the extra tablspoon of FLOUR Steve G.  I asked my hubby what he thought of them (he works construction) and he said ""same old same old""  I could't agree more.  They left me unsatisfied and craving some sort of pie."
53425,70695,2004-06-08,4,"Very nice! I used chives instead of green onions, and light soy sauce. I didn't have any hoisin sauce so I omitted it. It seemed like a lot of sesame seeds while I was toasting them, but the amount was fine. Nice light crispy coating and tender chicken. "
133174,373356,2011-02-08,5,"This is so good and so simple.  I toasted the coconut in the microwave, stirring after every 30 seconds.  It takes about 2 to 3 minutes but toasts up nicely.  I used fresh pineapple and vanilla ice cream.  In addition to topping this with the coconut it was also topped with chopped macadamia nuts for a real tropical experience.  Made for Aussie Swap."
97780,52757,2010-07-17,5,"So yummy!  I made this on a Saturday morning with the idea of eating off it all week.  Planning to put it with cous cous to take to work for lunch, with crostina for side dish one day for dinner, and just eat it as suggested with some grated parm.  It was done to our liking after about 5 hours and when I tasted it...wow!  I almost (almost) wish we didn't have plans to go out tonight because I want to eat it all up now."
705251,432469,2010-09-05,4,This is a nicely refreshing beverage.  The flavor is very nice and unusual.  The coffee does not overwhelm the other flavors and the drink still retains its very pink color.  It is definitely going into my saved recipes folder to try again when I have some girlfriends over.  Thanks for sharing in Newest Zaar Tag.
895132,284944,2009-07-12,5,"Thinking about what to do with the organic beef we got from a local organic farmer, I decided to make someting spicy for DH and MIL - they both like it sweet and hot. I got hooked by this recipe because of the chocolate; I like playing around with chocolate in spicy dishes. Now I omitted the msg and only had thai chilis, and as I use to make nearly everything from scratch, I used my own tomato sauce and home made beef broth. Well, and I only have one kind of chili powder and cayenne pepper, so I used that. Actually I don't think the msg is necessary at all, because this exploded with flavors :)
Thanks for this recipe!"
59798,136923,2007-05-08,5,YUMMY!!!  Going to save me a lot of money from going to our favorite mexican resaurant...Thank you!
1677734,187731,2018-02-28,5,I have made this twice!! We love it! I soaked the shrimp in buttermilk for a short time - added a few drops of Frank's hot sauce. Then I dredged in corn starch seasoned with some old bay and a little creole seasoning. My hubby does not do hot &amp; spicy and this was not. But very good! Will be making again this weekend
226377,158997,2007-07-02,4,"The ginger flavor in this was perfect, I really loved it."
104295,70956,2004-12-26,4,"This is a nice frittata.  I halved it because my pan was pretty small.  Actually, not having a skillet that will go in the oven, I used a sauce pan.  My only problem was that it sunk in the middle but I think that was operator error!  We did find that the amount of onions was a bit too much for our taste, and I think the cheese was a little more then we like as well.  (I used a lovely low fat cheddar.)  That said, it was light and fluffy and a nice dinner."
89831,248606,2007-10-06,5,"made this for a test run for the holidays, this drink is excellent and needs no changes, I will make again, thanks CD!...Kitten:)"
217226,181533,2008-02-13,5,"It doesn't get much quicker or easier than this! I was immediately intrigued when I saw this recipe, and couldn't wait to try it...and it was a tasty, fun treat! I omitted the veggies because we're all quite picky, but made corn-on-the-cob to complete the hand-held meal, and I really liked the special touch the honey butter brought to these kabobs. I actually used 20 pieces of popcorn chicken, five for each skewer, and a 7 1/2-ounce tube of biscuits...and once we'd gobbled down the first four kabobs, I was asked to make seconds! Great recipe! Thanks!"
138051,50144,2008-10-23,0,"I thought this was pretty good. I didnt add any cheese or bacon. I used cream of celery soup. Cooked it five hours. I also pureed alot of the soup to make it creamy.

Would make again."
531768,23374,2007-12-07,5,I have had this one. It is wonderful! I will have to make it tonight again :)
418915,177174,2007-05-17,5,"It's hard to believe that 4 simple ingredients (note that you need SELF-RISING flour) can turn into such a fragrant, beautiful loaf of bread. Because of the simplicity of this tasty recipe, I have to give this recipe 5 stars. 
Note #1 - Do NOT overbeat the batter or you will beat the bubbles out of the beer - and the bubbles help the bread rise!
Note #2 - I poured my melted butter over the top of the unbaked loaf from the start of the baking time, and really love the way it helps create a salty, crispy exterior.
Note #3 - I added 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese to the second batch and it was also excellent."
965915,31745,2008-09-23,5,Used this recipe in my culinary class for my project on asparagus.. the entire class absolutely loved it.. thats 30 different people from all sorts of backrounds and palets who really really enjoyd it... definitely give it a try!... OH I ADDED A CLOVE OF GARLIC!!!
512461,211338,2012-01-31,5,I made this using fat free greek yogurt instead of the sour cream. Absolutely delicious. Thank you for a great recips
45019502,50719,2014-01-10,5,"Understand that these aren&#039;t muffins. They are basically yellow cake cupcakes with blueberries thrown in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That isn&#039;t saying they aren&#039;t good, though. They are! I love them. Add a bit of lemon and you&#039;ll be happy for forever. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It took me about 30 minutes to mix and bake them, which is pretty good when you&#039;re baking at 7AM! I had a bit of trouble because my margarine and sugar just wouldn&#039;t cream properly, but then again margarine does do that sometimes. So long as it was a bit fluffy and had mixed into the sugar well enough, it was fine. I also decided to sift my flour, salt and baking powder together, which worked out just fine. I also used fresh frozen blueberries, which ended up dying them purple :P But who cares! I&#039;d rather have purple muffins than pay 5 bucks for a carton of blueberries when a frozen bag is $2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All in all, this recipe is amazingly versatile. You can switch things out, you can add a bit of lemon juice, you can toss in some ginger if you want (Actually reaaally good), switch out some white sugar for brown or raw, turn it into mixed berry muffins if you want, everything. A yellowcake batter like this is pretty hard to mess up, and it&#039;ll never steer you wrong."
892498,20048,2010-02-23,5,Delicious!  We absolutely loved this recipe.  The seasonings were delicious and the texture was perfect.  (I used plain breadcrumbs with italian seasonings added.)  Thanks for this!  Will use again and again.
424680,281294,2008-07-14,5,"Did leave out the instant coffee (surprise, surprise!) but other than that, made these as per the recipe & had some GREAT TASTING bars to serve over the weekend! Nice & sweet, just like they should be!! Thanks for the keeper! [Made & reviewed in Beverage Tag cooking game]"
350938,367098,2010-05-03,5,Very tender and tasty. So easy to make. Thanks for sharing your lovely recipe :)
382203,205025,2009-01-04,5,"I can not believe I forgot to rate this. First, Thank you so much for this recipe.  We have a cabin on the Gulf Islands in BC and in the summer have lots of friends drop by, these were a live saver.
I made a new muffin each morning and they loved them all.
I have made several batches of these and shared them with friends and family.  Thanks again"
130819,96428,2007-08-25,5,With a Pierre Dance recipe and a Bev Ellis recommend - how could one miss! Yes another of the Pierre Dance recipes that proved to be a winner. Made as  posted - used the best paprika I could find here in Saskatchewan - worked for me! And yes garden fresh tomatoes! The Jasmine rice - one of my favorites - the Sangria - I'm working on that! Thank you Pierre for posting those great recipes of yours.
2001761574,184719,2017-10-22,4,"A easy recipe for kids with allergies, and best part is it is GFDF. Tweaked by baking it 50 miutes at 180&deg;C and kids added sprinkles"
458309,82023,2007-12-07,5,"This was the most PERFECT meal...EVER!!!  I followed the recipe precisely and everything turned out wonderfully!   I can now ask for anything that I want and get it! ;) DH is putty in my hands after eating this.  I'm going to make this all the time.
Thanks so much for sharing!"
713116,399686,2013-03-03,5,"We served this with Christmas Dinner and it was wonderful!  Simple, classic flavor.  Exactly what we wanted, recipe was perfect as written.  Thanks!"
2002136055,379283,2018-04-30,5,"Love this recipe! I am half Puerto Rican, but grew up with my mother who is not, so I am just now learning as an adult how to cook the things I remember from my childhood with my father's side of the family. I've been looking for a rice recipe for years that reminded me of my Uela's and Titi's, and this is it! The only change is that I add 5 slices of diced bacon in the pan with the oil before the rest of the ingredients. I drizzle some oil, add the diced bacon to my Bass Pro Shops cast iron pot, fry it up, then make the rest of the recipe as listed, including the 5 minutes on low at the end for the crispies, which is the perfect amount of time! This recipe never fails, and I'm excited to be able to have my own rice and beans recipe to pass along in the future!"
183964,277870,2008-06-01,5,"I loved this recipe! A very hearty ""manly"" soup! Spicy with sharp flavors. I only had two brats left over from a cookout so I diced those up added about three cups of small steamed broccoli florets to the mix and it didn't hurt one bit! The mustard and horseradish make this dish special."
518106,27893,2007-08-07,5,"This is something I like to bring to any get-together or potluck with a side of nacho cheese chips to dip in!  The only thing I change is I don't use guacamole and whenever I want to serve it as more of a meal for a potluck, I add about 1 pound of ground beef seasoned with some taco seasoning (cumin, chili powder, garlic salt, black pepper, and dash of sage).  Thanks for posting this!"
28345,19346,2003-04-28,4,Very good and very garlicky!
65573,200201,2008-05-08,0,"I like the combination of the onions and bacon on a pizza, but since I couldn't find fromage blanc anywhere and had to use regular shredded mozzarella, I'm not leaving any stars yet. Will keep looking for fromage blanc when I go to specialty stores, and will make again. Made for PAC."
1046155,73062,2010-03-20,5,"These are truly the best pork chops I've ever had! We couldn't believe how juicy they were. I used seasoned breadcrumbs and added 3/4 tsp italian seasoning and 2 tbsp parmesean cheese. I only did 4 chops but the same amount of milk and salt in a smaller pan and brined for 2 hours. My boneless chops were 1"" thick, and they didn't cook all the way through, so we ended up having to microwave them...and they were STILL the juiciest I've ever eaten! Next time I'll cook on medium heat for 5 mins per side. Thanks for a great recipe!"
168896,12367,2006-07-24,5,i was looking for a recipe that would take care of my craving for the starbuck's apricot bar which sells for 2.00 a piece for a very small piece by the way.  i tried this and it was just as good if not better.  i didnt have apricot so i used my daughter's organic wholekids strawberry jam.  very tasty; super easy to make and when i make it again i'll use a few walnuts as well.  thanks for the recipe.
2001720320,24617,2017-09-18,2,"good consistancy, however, the taste was awful. Maybe because I used wheat flour instead of white?.... (though I use wheat flour for quite a bit of my other baking with no problems)...either way not sweet enough and lacked flavor. I was super bummed because I feel like I wasted my ingredients (especially the nuts which are expensive)."
1274599,482040,2015-09-20,5,"Simple, yet very delicious.  I had some mushrooms in my fridge that I needed to get rid of so I chopped them up and added them to this dish.  It was so good.  It didn&#039;t need the mushrooms, but they gave the dish some meaty texture."
357358,60238,2008-06-18,5,"Everyone in my family gave this two ""thumbs up"". I made a batch of mashed potatoes and 4 large potatoes made just enough for this recipe. I did substitute real bacon for the bacon bits due to personal preference and it was fine. Since I had no onion salt, I just added some salt and onion powder. I also added 1/4 tsp of white pepper to the cheese layer. Next time we decided we are going to crumble Frenches' Cheddar Fried Onion Rings on top before baking. Yum!"
351578,224629,2007-08-03,4,A refreshing tasty smoothie! I enjoy trying new combinations and this was different for me with the pineapple and grapefruit. Very good!
190112,3397,2005-07-25,5,"These are better than any store-bought bread & butter pickle! My wife made these and I was suprised at how little time it took her from start to finish (our mandolin made fast work of the cucumbers). We decided to follow Tweeky's advice and only use 1/4 cup of sugar, and they turned out just great."
54678,13546,2003-09-15,5,"I have made this dough recipe for years - quick - no waiting to rise. My recipe says warm water 105 to 115 degrees and the oil was vegetable. Makes enough for 2-11"" or 1 deep dish 13x9x2"" pizzas. Thanks for posting - now its in my zaar cookbook."
236760,159753,2006-03-16,5,This was easy and delicious.  What I like is that you don't have to make them until you need them & until then - - no storage space wasted....thanks.
157425,114410,2005-05-01,5,Enjoyed the tenderloins and even better the next day as a sald. My DD enjoyed the tropical taste of it.
381538,10290,2006-11-12,4,"Delicious and very easy.  I used yellow onion instead of green and used flour instead of the cornstarch.  I doubled the sauce and every bit was eaten up.  The sauce was a bit runny, so next time I will either cook longer or add more flour/cornstarch. I also used sun-dried tomatoes in oil.  I just drained the oil out so it wasn't too greasy."
58038,35482,2003-08-12,3,"This was fine and very easy to make.  For us, it definitely could have used a lot more cheese.  Otherwise, it was a nice, simple dish."
44650,117498,2005-04-17,5,"I found this recipe while last night while I was up with a bad allergy attack. what better way to spend the time than recipe surfing. I made this today. It is absolutely fabulous! Very easy to make. I made two changes. I was out of oleo so I used Butter Flavor Crisco. also, since I'm diabetic, I used my Splenda Baking Blend. It came out perfect. Thanks for the really great recipe! "
252816,179336,2009-02-19,5,"Steps are not in proper order,TO SAVE TIME... You should haveROASTGARLIC AS FIRST STEP. tHEN SCAMPI SAUCE,THEN WHITE SAUCE THEN THE CHICKEN..I dont know if this is a O.G.recipe or not , I havent had it before. But this was real good.Used all the white sauce as some commented on.Also cubed the chicken,Topped off dish with a handful of fresh parmesean..I will make this often..Thank U for the recipe.."
2001261346,23257,2016-12-05,5,I made this last night with brisket and it was awesome! Will definitely make again. I did not use paprika and salted heavily along with alot of pepper.
184469,97534,2009-01-19,5,"Cranked these out assembly line style for a few dozen people (mostly kids!) at a playdate today. I did toast the muffins first. Careful - they cook rather quickly under the broiler. Kids and parents were happy. A real crowd-pleaser for relatively little money and time. I used Wegmans ""Food You Feel Good About"" pizza sauce. Will definitely do these for playdates in the future."
1263528,9506,2009-08-09,5,Very simple to make and very tasty.  We make it frequently.  Thank you.
107308,71557,2004-07-23,5,"DH and I both agree...5 stars all the way.  We enjoyed this easy and delicious dish very much.  In fact we had an argument (friendly kind) about who got the last thigh & I lost.  I did forgot to skin the thighs so a lot of liquid accumulated in the pan, but I just poured it off before adding the shallots. Thanks, Mickie, for such a simple dish.  I promise you, we will be eating this again!   "
170181,203922,2007-12-25,5,"Excellent Christmas Morning treat! We added cubed pieces of Cream Cheese along with the Berries and it gave it a nice touch.
Thanks for posting it!"
347822,44232,2007-04-23,4,"Very good recipe.  I used sliced ciabatta bread, and spread a mix of extra virgin olive oil and one mashed garlic clove to each slice with a brush.  Placed them in the oven at 450 degrees for five minutes.  Right after I took them out of the oven and spread shredded mozzarella on the slices.  The heat from the toast melted the cheese, then served them with the tomatoe mix.  Very important to leave the tomatoe mix sit for 20 mins, so the tomatoe can absorb the vinegar and garlic. It was awesome as an appetizer."
2001474968,224947,2017-04-06,5,"I made this for me and my boyfriend last night for dinner. I only added a bit more seasoning to the chicken before putting on the bread crumbs. It was delicious, definitely going to make again. Oh I definitely recommend cutting 1 chicken breast in half to make 2. A whole chicken breast was too much (unless you're REALLY hungry) so I wont do that next time."
199848,509630,2013-11-25,5,"Definitely better than take-out!   Of course, you have to use a good-quality chicken stock/broth.  The texture was just perfect.  I only used about 1 tsp of soy sauce and I added some extra scallions.  This is so easy to make with only a few simple ingredients.  The recipe instructions were excellent.  Thanx for posting!"
522496,1207,2007-09-01,5,Works well with 2% milk.
56087,41065,2003-02-22,0,When I made this recipe mine turned out kind of dry and flat. I only baked for 20 minutes.  I was really let down.  For the life of me I cannot figure out what I did wrong.  I won't star it at this time until I retry it to see if it's something I did.  
527579,51943,2007-10-27,4,Worked a treat.Next time would try rolling bread slightly to flatten before using. Would be good with other veggies...mushrooms & leeks?
1620171,467841,2013-10-20,5,These were delicious and went beautifully with your Wellington recipe. What an amazing dinner.
246844,203932,2008-06-23,4,"This was quiet an experience for me! As a Southerner, this was a revelation.  I'd never heard of sauteeing the greens..and only cooking them for 15 minutes?  I thought they'd be very bitter.  I ended up cooking them for about 20 and they had a much prettier color than I am used to and tasted wonderful,  although I did miss having pot liquor. In the American South, we cook them in water or other liquid and consider the resulting ""pot liquor"" to be just as important as the greens. This is why I love ZWT.  You learn new things about foods you'd never think could surprise you.  Thanks for sharing!"
246482,134710,2007-05-25,5,"This was easy to make and the kitchen smelt so very good while it was simmering on the stove. I left off the whipped cream as hubby isn't allowed any. I like the colouring when it is sliced, just a hint of red then its white.
Excellent dessert."
125388,11455,2008-08-10,5,It doesn't get much easier than this.  This was so good - I served it with baked fish and it was a super-easy meal with superb flavor.
64642,325046,2010-04-11,5,This is the exact recipe The Lodge at Sedona (AZ) uses.
485109,375466,2011-05-30,5,"We LOVED this recipe! It tastes fantastic and is so easy to make! I had never made a dipping oil with sundried tomato paste but it absolutely made this dish, so I was probably a bit generous with the paste! Mine sat for about 24 hours before being used. I'll make this very often! Made for ZWT7."
518106,98981,2008-09-03,5,What a great and simple after-school snack!  I have 5 teenagers at a group home that my husband and I are houseparents at and they just devoured this.  I'm always on the lookout for easy snacks for these guys and boy this hit the spot!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!
55523,49549,2009-07-08,5,"These are delicious!  They are easy to prepare, smell great while cooking and are gone in a snap.  What a nice change from plain old fries.  Thank you for sharing yet another great, family pleasing recipe!"
101823,90473,2009-01-04,3,"I prepared this as one of the many offerings on the buffet at my holiday open house.  While I liked the blend of sweet and spicy, others were not so impressed.  It was basically ignored, although it did have a festive presentation."
142386,86693,2009-01-01,5,Yum. Taste a little like hummus.  I really liked this.  Served with wheat crakers and pita bread.  It was great.  Thaks for posting.
222564,276438,2014-05-05,5,"I did reduce the butter quite a bit, not that we don&#039;t like it, but OH MY GOD, THESE MUSSELS ARE SUPERB! Enough for 4? I don&#039;t think so, for 2, yes."
350192,62994,2007-12-02,5,"I needed a way to use up all my extra creamcheese so this was an awesome recipe!  So far we have made 20 cookies and that is only about a third to a half of the dough - so i am betting we'll get a lot of cookies out of this.

I didn't try any alternatives people listed, but I used my 1/3% less fat CC and I didn't have any eggs, so I used egg-substitute and that seemed to work jsut as well.
Great texture."
407083,195502,2011-11-20,5,"This sound like a wonderful recipe. Has anyone tried using applesauce in place of the oil? I have a jar of apple butter that needs to be used. I wonder if I could use that instead of the oil and cut back the sugar. I'm not a very ""seasoned"" baker. Any suggestions? Thanks :)"
2002092071,100196,2018-04-02,5,Just like my mom used to make...turned out great!
228229,242856,2009-11-23,5,"Amazing! We doubled the ginger, garlic, and onions, because we love all of those. We didn't have any sambal oelek, but we replaced it with sweet red Thai chili sauce, and I can't imagine it tasting any better. Will add orange zest next time to see if that improves on it. Thanks!"
414923,198707,2007-02-18,5,"The soup was perfect for my family.  I tend to like soups that are a tad exotic, but this is the kind of soup that's right up my teenagers' alley.  I took other people's advice and used 8 cups of stock instead of water...(homemade! my first ever!).  I used 4 spilt chicken breasts which produced a LOT of meat at the end.  Great soup.  Very easy, great smells, happy family, happy Mom.  Thanks!!"
1218197,236077,2009-06-23,4,"Absolutely loved this, tastes just like it came from a restuarant, I added a splash of heavy cream and a couple of spoonfuls of tomato puree, to make it a little thicker, but went down a storm in my household!!"
254415,59003,2006-01-02,5,Exactly what I was looking for. Turned out flavorful and the stuffing addition makes a great presentaton.  It was a delicous combo.
486725,113670,2010-12-23,5,This was really yummy. Like breakfast for dinner. I took your suggestion and added the green onions. I also used only about a third of the cheese and salt (this still looked like a ton of cheese to us!). Three people ate this for a meal with sides.
185926,255269,2010-01-26,4,I added half a chopped green  and orange peppers. I did not use so much broth.  Very good.  We enjoyed it.  Thank you.
152552,97553,2005-02-28,5,"This was great. I used it with my ""Cooking and The Internet"" class. Thank you."
252816,88763,2007-06-17,2,"I made 6 different muffin recipes for our family camping trip.All were eatten but these..No one really cared for the flavor and the muffins are dry..I am sorry,but will not be making again.."
353245,69091,2006-09-17,5,Got outstanding results by using blender in lieu of food mill. Put two cups of cooked grapes into blender and blend at medium for about 30-45 seconds. Then pour into large kitchen strainer (wire mesh) and swirl the bottom of a ladle over mixture to work it through. Now cook it down. Fantastic results - even without sweetening.
147145,102274,2009-03-27,5,"It was a cold, snowy day yesterday and I made this soup with some cornbread for supper. It was very good! I made about half the recipe for the two of us. Mods - Used yellow onions instead of white, white wine vinegar instead of the cider, a homemade spice mixture (cumin, coriander, red chillies) and I didn't measure anything, just added until it felt right. I didn't have liquid smoke either so I added about a 1/4 tsp of smoked paprika - it was awesome. This is a very filling soup, perfect with a side of bread. Thanks, Little Bee, for posting this excellent recipe!"
679953,338457,2009-05-29,5,"What a nice, simple delicious meal !! I made the recipe as posted but added a dash of pepper.  A KEEPER HERE.  Made for PRMR tag."
230258,128810,2006-05-22,4,"These were great! For my dried fruit, I used chopped Real Fruit fruit snacks! It was something different but delcious! They melted but then regained texture when they were back at room temperature! As a tip, I would grease the pan really well as mine didn't come to easily probaly because I didn't grease it enough.
Other than that, it was great!
Thanks for the recipe MommyMakes!"
206747,123717,2007-01-31,5,"This made a GREAT, professional-looking salad, to serve with recipe #133738, ""Shrimp with Roasted Red Pepper Cream"" !  I did all the chopping early in the day, and just let all the drained ingredients sit together in the frig.  At tht last minute, sliced the romaine and added (the almost doubled) dressing.  It was colorful, healthy, and VERY tasty.  Thanks, kburie, for an addition to my favorite file.
Janey"
396078,256603,2008-09-16,4,This was a very tasty recipe!  It smelled wonderful while cooking.  This is something I would only make once in a while due to its being high-calorie.  It's definitely comfort food!  I only made two adjustments--country-style pork ribs instead of spareribs and added a teaspoon of garlic powder.  Yummy!  Thank you!
956686,33919,2009-03-24,5,"This was really good.  I only had a 32 oz. can of refried beans, and about 1/2 the cheese, and no sour cream, and I didn't have mushroom soup....so I replaced the sour cream with cottage cheese, and I did add a can of rotel, and some ground up spinach, and for the soup used recipe #25653.  Everybody loved it.  I am having some for breakfast."
386936,47939,2007-06-05,5,Oh my gosh are these things good!!! Made them for an appetizer at a b-day party and they were a huge hit.  I made both the jalepeno and pinento and I don't know which ones I like better.  Next time I'm going to try the blue cheese stuffed olives.  Just thinking about them again is making my mouth water.
47907,125557,2008-10-15,5,"For some reason, I LOVE blue drinks!  This one was delicious and it would be great to serve at a BBQ or pool party.  I made as posted using our smoothie machine.  Thanks for posting!  Made for PAC Fall 2008."
188574,8348,2006-05-26,5,"Great cake, like has been said already comes out very moist, and light. Couldnt tell it was Saurkraut in it. I took some ideas from other recipes and added some chopped pecans and some desicated coconut. I will try to remember to take a phot next time I make this. Thanks."
37449,460469,2013-08-24,5,I love pickled cucumbers and this was yummy! I enjoyed the hot pepper in it too. Thanks! Made for ZWT 2013 for team Hot Stuff.
34094,103175,2006-12-18,5,So easy to make and I got so MANY compliments. I've begun sharing the link to this recipe with several other people. I used mini cherry chips instead of cinnamon imperials since my boys don't like them. I hope the tasted good because they were all gone before I got one myself. Thanks for sharing!
28168,9773,2011-07-31,5,"WOW! This was absolutely delicious. I licked the plate to get the last bit of sauce. We were out of soy sauce, and were worried that we'd ruin the taste making it with substitutions, but it was still amazing. We will certainly be making this recipe again."
37636,232907,2009-06-05,5,Delicious! So simple to make and is a nicely different topping for ice cream. The rum really doesn't need to cook as it will evaporate and then you won't get an ignite. Just remember to remove it from the burner before you add the rum and ignite it or there could be a fire. Otherwise very safe. Made by a Saucy Senorita for ZWT5
184351,219823,2007-04-06,4,"These were so easy to make, and very tasty! My kids and DH loved them, and my DH usually doesn't like cooked carrots! I would highly recommend these - a wonderful side dish for any main dish!"
571308,103215,2009-11-06,5,"I usually open a package of Trader Joe's Orange Chicken, cook up some rice and that's dinner. However, since I had the time and ingredients, decided to try this recipe and am glad I did. The chicken was tender and cooked just right and the flavor was wonderful- not too strong or too mild. It was so good that my husband even swept the floor after dinner without me asking! (I had corn starch all over the floor since I'm a messy cook!)
I'll certainly be making this again."
174096,170258,2010-05-29,5,"Yup, filling and good!  Great flavors!  I tried a similar dish earlier, which was also good, but the addition of the tomato in this one really brought it up a notch.  It was a good flavor addition, plus it imparted some much needed liquid that was missing from the variation without.  I omitted the salt, as we found the ham and bacon to add plenty for our taste.

452045,94900,2009-06-22,5,"Absolutely delicious. Used 1 cup 35% cream with 1 cup of milk instead of 2 cups of milk as suggested by another reviewer - a brilliant idea. Added an idea from other recipes namely 3 big drops of Tabasco and 1/2 teaspoon of Worcester sauces. We loved it with fresh baked rolls it only lasted for 2 and a bit serves. One word of caution. The scallops will be like bullets if cooked for 15 minutes (must be a typo). We cooked everything except scallops for 10 minutes at Step 5 then added scallops for the last 5 minutes only and they were perfect.
Thanks Winni for an excellent recipe. We are going to try leek and mushroom ideas next."
424680,447361,2011-05-04,5,"Very easy to make & great tasting, too! We really enjoyed the Parmesan & garlic combo in this winning recipe! A keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing it! [Made & reviewed in Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup tag]"
41809,38704,2002-09-24,5,"This is a wonderful salad dressing.  I took a big taste before I added the cayenne and it was super.  I doubled the recipe (2 tspns. cayenne) stirred it up and took another big taste.  Yikes, it set my dentures on fire!  Just wanted to let you know as a body may want to cut back on the amount of ""heat"".
Other than that, this is so creamy and yummy and I sure don't want to detract from how good the recipe really is.
It's definitely a keeper and I appreciate you posting.
Thanks a bunch.

2000260636,76864,2015-06-10,0,This recipe sucks! Don&#039;t try to make it you&#039;ll be disappointed like I am right now! The dough was rock solid and still raw inside! I followed every step of this instructions. But the icing was good.
4503402,388257,2014-11-22,5,"This is an excellent recipe.  Ever since I started using it, I&#039;ve been asked to make the Thanksgiving turkey every year!  The turkey is moist and flavorful.  Everybody always tells me it&#039;s the best turkey they&#039;ve ever had!"
617565,194466,2008-12-21,5,I made this fot Thanksgiving and I will double the recipe for christmas. AWESOME!
369715,97617,2010-11-10,3,This was just OK for us. I followed the recipe as written other then I used light cream. I used italian seasoning instead of just basil. We thought it needed more flavor. We did add salt and pepper and liked it a bit more. Not sure what it as missing but it was missing something for us.
53425,64852,2004-02-17,3,"This was okay, but terribly bland. I should have followed Charishma's lead and added six POWDERED cardamon pods instead of the three WHOLE ones that I used - I am sure it would have been much better. I soaked the tapioca in cold water (as instructed on my package.) As noted by the other two reviewers, it still took a lot of cooking to get it soft - but that's tapioca for you. I ended up adding quite a bit more milk than called for as it was getting terribly thick while the tapioca was still hard. I will make this again, but I will want to adjust the spicing considerably. "
718022,29765,2009-08-16,5,"This is a wonderful salad to impress dinner guests or just 
""The Hubby"" for a romantic dinner starter.
A definite 5+ stars.
Thank you Sharlene!"
27744,228909,2010-02-25,4,"These were fabulous.  I accidentally bought honey mustard, but the recipe still tasted fantastic.  I used the oven method, and next time will line my baking dish with foil, as the marinade does bake in to a sticky mess.  Love it!"
482376,349465,2011-03-08,5,Great variation for cooking green beans. Perfect for the winter months because of the use of frozen green beans. I halved this recipe and it was enough for about 6 people. I used Montreal Steak Seasoning. I really loved the flavor it gave the green beans. It's something I would never have tried before. ~Made for Pick A Chef 2011~
197023,74760,2005-11-20,5,"Recipes so scrumptious really just donât come any easier than this.  Fabulously clear instructions inviting one into the whole magical world of homemade sorbets which are â from the first one I made totally superior to whatâs available in commercial brands!  And to be able to make this without buying an extra appliance I absolutely donât have room for in the kitchen: just so exciting!  I made a blackberry and strawberry sorbet and, like Susang, I added no sugar.  Very easily done, for me: I really donât like overly sweet foods.  I unreservedly recommend this recipe as an over-the-top five-star recipe plus.  When youâre trying to watch calories and fat â I made this for the post ZWT Healthy for the Holidays Challenge â how amazing to be able to eat something like this which has such negligible fat content!  I look forward to exploring the many possibilities that this recipe offers.  Thank you so much, Jenny, for sharing an absolute gem of a recipe!"
235291,16741,2006-12-15,5,"This absolutely smelled wonderful while it was cooking! It has a great flavor just by itself. I added about 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper to ""kick it up"". Also added chicken buillion and omitted the salt. At the end I added additional broth as it was pretty thick. Yummy lunches with cornbread. Thanks for a keeper!!!"
424741,84,2007-01-13,5,This was excellent.  Wonderful flavor.  Perfect texture.  I cut the recipe in half but otherwise followed it exactly (using the option to cut the sprouts in half).  I was also fortunate enough to have fresh brussels sprouts from the farmers market.  The wine vinegar I have is probably not the best.  It would probably be even better with a better quality vinegar.  I might even try it with balsamic....
1887876,188637,2011-04-18,0,"I made this last night for Passover seder tonight. It was pretty easy to make, though a bit dry, as Passover cakes typically are. Because I am not concerned with kashruth, I will add some melted butter (maybe 1/4 stick?) at the very end."
1981436,23775,2011-08-13,4,"The ""meat"" balls were excellent.  My children each ate seconds.  Next time I will reduce the baking time or temperature because they were extra crunchy.  Also, next time I will saute a little fresh onion and garlic with the eggplant and omit the powdered seasoning.  This is a winner!"
200822,218874,2008-02-23,5,"This was DELICIOUS!  I actually just saw this recipe in the new ""Kraft"" magazine I got recently and decided to try it today.   The ONLY change I made was to use a frozen bag of peas & carrots instead of mixed veggies, as my husband doesn't like the corn in the mixed.  Otherwise, left as is.  Even my nearly 2 year old daughter gobbled hers up.  I'll be having the leftovers later!  Yum!"
138861,71864,2005-10-03,5,"Very yummy! This is a recipe that I chose for pick a chef, and I'm very glad that I did! I made it exactly as the recipe says and it turned out wonderfully!I made this to serve to my in-laws and even though my FIL said he prefers the traditional lasagne, this was still very good. I really enjoyed the blend of the spinach and the ricotta cheese. I will definately make this recipe again. Thanks Pixie!"
668128,241843,2007-11-27,5,I tried this recipe out on some homemade fried pies as a glazing. I added a little extra corn starch and it made a perfect glaze That was the finishing tough to a splenda made fried pie thanks so much
729254,69736,2009-12-08,5,"Superb! These are light, delicious, and elegant. Great base recipe that you can add many flavors or spices to. I added vanilla paste and orange zest. Simply wonderful result."
185285,51740,2005-08-21,5,Yum!  I added a dash of balsamic for personal taste.  Great dish!
228392,339905,2010-01-15,5,I've thrown away all my other bread machine recipes. This is wonderful! It raises so well and produces such a light weight loaf for the size. My kids were amazed that it raised the top on my bread machine! Have been making a loaf every other day for two weeks from this recipe. Thanks for a great recipe!
199792,84733,2005-04-18,5,"This is excellent and easy. I covered the fillet with foil to start and then opened the foil for the last 5 minutes. I had to cook a little longer at a lower heat as I had other things in the oven but I don't think it hurt it at all. I can't wait until tomorrow for the leftovers. By the way, used Ultra low fat mayo! Yum!"
2001868267,355637,2017-12-18,5,"Lovely! My rice flour was not sweet and it wasn't noticeable. I made two cakes from this mix, perfect portion size in my opinion. Microwaved for two mins at 750w. Topped with creme fra&igrave;che and a Cointreau chocolate sauce."
197023,358240,2009-03-14,5,"A delicious mushroom recipe which I greatly enjoyed for today's lunch.  I used 2 lasagne noodles, a mix of oyster mushrooms and Swiss Browns, low-fat cream (still amply creamy for my taste) and I added some minced garlic, sage and thyme when adding the rosemary, salt and pepper.  Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe, duonyte.  Made for Newest Zaar Tag."
2552471,209764,2012-12-09,5,"This was my first attempt at gluten-free cake baking & it was a resounding success! My gluten-full family thoroughly enjoyed it.  I used an 11"" round pan & added 3/8 cup more sugar.  I used cream cheese frosting & it was DELICIOUS!"
416191,360161,2009-03-31,5,"Excellent soup! I think that the dill flavor puts it over the top.This will be a favourite in my home.I did not use the thyme though. Use dill, not parsley! Thankyou for the post."
14165,13949,2002-04-18,5,Excellent and really easy.  Great when served with mashed potatoes.
280271,481452,2014-04-12,4,I&#039;m really sorry to give this a four star...but the ingredients says to use wasabi paste...but the direction say to use wasabi powder...???...that&#039;s confusing...anyway I used the paste...the mayo mixture was delicious...the rest of the ingredients were really good but nothing that I would think stood out above the rest of the hamburgers in the world...overall the burger was packed full of flavor with the right touch of heat...thanks for posting it...Made for Spring 2014 PAC...=)
327445,119957,2006-10-09,5,These were awesome! I skipped the butter and added some garlic powder. Wonderful recipe!
15572,52511,2003-02-07,5,"Instead of steaming them, I sauteed the carrots and beans in Marsala.  Followed the directions otherwise.  Next time I will add some slivered almonds for crunch."
449500,128543,2009-08-19,5,"I was looking for a butterscotch pie recipe to make for my husband's birthday and this is PERFECT!  It is simple and quick to make.  As he doesn't like meringue I baked the cooked pie crust with the filling as instructed, let it cool, then slid it into the fridge and topped it with whipped cream when I served it.  This was a fantastic recipe - thank you so much for sharing!"
2001375399,137364,2017-02-02,5,"This is a great recipe - or should I say, riceipe. Will be using from now on ????"
1209783,142924,2010-01-29,5,"The lemon juice in this recipe turns a tasty and savory, yet standard, risotto dish into a very delightfully fresh meal. The heavy, creamy flavor of the rice and the tart sweetness of lemon both mingle together strongly and are not subdued by each other in the least."
264012,135063,2010-03-23,5,"MMMMM..... These were delicious. I made these with the Pumpkin Maple Sauce included in Recipe #72343. I used this pancake recipe instead of that one because i love molasses and wanted that flavor in there too. 
Thanks for posting."
129333,28588,2006-10-24,5,very good added a bag of frozen stir fry vegs
799622,510995,2014-02-27,5,Absolutely excellent vegetarian recipe - I am not a vegetarian and I loved it!
802773,245231,2008-07-04,5,"What a treat!  It definitely lived up to the description of earlier reviewers.  I used 1/2 tsp of vanilla, all of the maple syrup (love that stuff) and did not add any cinnamon.  Also, I used a 4 1/2 X 8 1/2 loaf pan and it fit perfectly.  This recipe is a keeper!"
47510,32250,2003-08-23,3,"Made this recipe exactly as stated and was pleased with the ease of preparation.  It had too much thyme taste to suit me though.  Slathering on lots of ketchup masked some of the taste of the thyme.  If I make this again, I'll decrease the amount used.  I served this with Spicy Potato Wedges with Ranch #37935 by Rainberry Blues.
"
345915,83960,2009-09-22,4,One daughter liked it and the other did not.  I thought it was just OK.  The flavor did seem better once they were pretty cool.  When they were hot the apple flavor didn't come through very well.  I used real sugar and 2% cheese.  I guess I expected more from this.
205966,90822,2005-03-28,0,"Delicious & easy to prepare.

This one gets many many repeat requests - from Cypriots too so they should know what they're talking about!

Do yourself a favour and turn the necessary evil of the boring potato into something of a centrepiece. You won't regret it."
46303,399,2002-07-05,4,"These spaetzle are delicious.  This recipe makes a lot... at least 8 servings.  We are two adults and two small kids and next time I will use 1/3rd of this recipe.  Also, I found pushing through a strainer too hard (I don't have a press); however, I tried using a knife to push the dough through the slits in a pancake flipper and that seemed to work OK."
11176,86868,2006-12-03,5,"Deeeeeeeelicious! I always have my doubts about beer in food (I know, I'm weird that way, but I had a bad experience using a dark beer in a stew once), but this was absolutely wonderful! I had a slightly larger than 2 lb brisket, so cut the recipe in half, though I upped the garlic. One can never have too much garlic. The only thing I'd change, and it's just cuz I'm a wussy, is cut the spices down which have a tendency to make a dish sweet. But my husband went back for.... FOURTHS. :shock: I think that's the first time I've ever seen him do that. I guess we'll be adding this to our repertoire. ;)  Thanks, Dee!"
441981,194472,2007-06-17,4,"This was really good, I loved it! I gave it 4 because my  boyfriend thought it was good, but not great. I will make it again with Boneless chops, we used bone-in, which he doesn't like. I woud also uncover it at the end because it stuffing was really mushy, but the apply onion mix was good, we used vidalia onions."
653438,449916,2011-04-07,5,"Made this last night to go with Mexican Chicken Enchiladas#417053 and what a tasty dish.  I followed the recipe using frozen corn, mexican crema and roasted the poblano chiles.  Like gailanng I did add some cilantro and topped with some more cilantro and sliced green onions.  Thank you for a delicious recipe."
362919,12920,2007-06-30,5,"we made this the other night, in attempts to find a way we can enjoy pork chops and this was a great pick, the only change id make would be to add more bread next time because there almost wasnt enough, i love how the bread soaks up the sauce from the creamed corn but is still left slightly 'crispy' great recipe - will be making again"
523494,410687,2010-05-03,5,Easy and delicious! I used a bottle of Shiner's Bohemian Black Lager beer which gave it an amazingly rich flavor. I used some of the extra strained and seasoned cooking liquid to mash with black beans. Used the chicken and black beans to make tostadas with lots of cheese for my family. My mother hates beer but LOVED this. Now she's gonna have to go buy beer... :D
74652,178890,2007-03-24,5,"This was fantastic!  I made it low cal using reduced fat Catalina dressing, reduced fat cheese and sour cream.  I loved this salad and so did DH this will be a regular during the Summer months!  Thanks~"
826796,74529,2012-11-05,5,"Very rich, with a wonderfully complex flavour. Served a big batch of this at a Mexican Day of the Dead Potluck and it was all gone! The orange zest and saffron add a nice ""grown up"" taste to this and keeps it from being too sweet. Very decadent though - half a cup was enough for me. Will make this again!"
527607,217644,2008-03-06,5,"outstanding.  I really did not want to cook or eat, but knew i needed something and the spicing was just right. I did add some ground cumin to it as well since i enjoy it in my mexican meat."
496437,381974,2009-08-11,5,"YEA!!  thanks so much for posting this.  I was looking for the recipe and this is perfect.  I loved it as a child and wanted to make it for my little boy, but I had never learned how to cook my mom's wonderful Puerto Rican food, and so didn't even know where to begin.  He loved it!!  And he's a picky little guy.  We didn't use the sugar but otherwise followed our direction exactly.  I poured more milk on after it was cooked to help cool it and to make it more ""soup like"".  It brought back such childhood memories (for those of you who didn't grow up with this, it's not going to be a flavorful meal, but it really is great for those sour little tummies or just as a quick soup on a cold day)."
1754681,47391,2013-06-16,0,"We tried this &amp; it&#039;s a WINNER in this family, tried it with Cole Slaw yummmmy"
207137,98388,2006-09-29,4,"We really enjoyed this soup, I used the hand blender to puree it for the kids as they are funny about veggies but they both ate it all!!! It was a nice tasting easy to make soup, I used real onion instead of the dried flakes. Thanks for a yummy soup recipe."
2181366,110223,2013-04-08,5,"This dish was WONDERFUL. Gotta love those one pot, fix it and forget it meals.Followed the recipe exactly except for the potatoes. All I had were small russets so I just halved them and they held up just fine. Since we are all kielbasa and kraut lovers, this will definitely be amoung the monthly rotations."
197097,73274,2013-03-16,5,"This recipe is wonderful and sooo easy to make!  I had never made these before I found this recipe.  I decided to make these to pass out for Christmas last year and everyone loved them.  Since then I&#039;ve made quite a few batches.  They are a little time consuming but so worth it.   I followed the recipe to the letter...I read some reviews that said to turn the heat down to low to cook but I followed the advice of one reviewer that said to keep  it at med-high and that&#039;s what I did.  I also made sure to stir the caramel  constantly...once the mixture melts it takes about 30 min. or so to reach 248 degrees. The caramel came out perfect.  Just be sure to coat your apples quickly and sprinkle any toppings you may have on immediately.  The apples set quickly.  I used chopped, roasted almonds, mini chocolate chips and chocolate drizzle on the apples. I read that some say to use buttered wax paper to set your apples on.  I did this the 1st few times I made these but just discovered the use of parchement paper.  It works beautifully!  NOTHING sticks to it and you don&#039;t have to butter it or spray with anything.   After they set I put them in cellophane bags tied with Christmas ribbon and they look so beautiful and professional...Thanks for the wonderful recipe!"
311003,29636,2010-10-09,5,"Mmm -- this was really good.  I brewed the coffee and stirred in the sugar while it was still hot, just to be sure it dissolved completely, and then put the coffee in a carafe in the fridge to cool.  When it was cold I added the milk and just a splash of cream.  All the good taste of Dunkin' Donuts coffee at a fraction of the price!"
64625,23439,2008-05-23,0,Another good dip that went over so well with the group I took it along to.  Used goat feta cheese.  Tastes great with veggie platter items as well as crackers.  Thanks!
49918,290736,2008-08-22,4,"Went to the cabinet tonight and found that I was out of jarred spaghetti sauce.  So I opened up Recipezaar and found this recipe.  I did make a few changes because of what I had available in the pantry.  I started out with a pound of ground beef since I had already thawed it and added all the rest of the ingredients to it once it was browned.  I didn't have tomato paste so I used 2 small cans of tomato sauce and omitted the water.  I did add some extra spices to taste and I also left out the rosemary because I did not have any.  My husband and kids loved it and my son asked me if I could make it like that every night.  Thanks for posting this recipe, it really saved dinner tonight!"
220715,18039,2009-03-22,5,"Great recipe! I had a very small loin (.8 kg or around 2lb) and with 3.5 cups of water with some veggies tossed in it all turned out well. Could have easily gone with less water.

Attempted to make a gravy with the remaining drippings / stock but that didn't turn out too well :) (nothing to do with this recipe though)"
1118816,113457,2009-03-02,5,"I alway used to wait for St Patricks Day to get these shakes,they are absolutly wonderful. It is so nice to have the recipe rather then having to go to McDonalds,I can make them myself."
832773,146012,2010-01-22,5,"Yumyumyum! I have never been to Red Lobster but I have always heard about their Cheddar Bay biscuits. I loved these! My BF was not a fan but I don't trust him when it comes to biscuits because he actually likes those canned store bought ones- gross. The Old Bay gave it such a different flavor. Thank you, Parkers Mom."
83503,31804,2009-08-06,5,"This is a fantastic chocolate cake.  It's very moist, dense but tender, and deeply chocolate.  As some other reviewers noted, it gets more moist as it sits so is best made a day ahead of serving.  I spread a thick layer of white chocolate ganache betwen the layers, and covered the ganache with a raspberry filling.  The tart raspberries paired well with the sweet ganache.  I covered the top of the cake with a thick layer of bittersweet chocolate ganache, and frosted the sides with a rich chocolate buttercream.  Because this cake isn't as sweet as some, you can lather on the frostings and fillings.  My layers were done in 29 minutes.  I dusted the pans with cocoa instead of flour.  To enhance the chocolate flavour, I added 1 tbsp. of instant espresso to the boiling water."
424680,467194,2011-12-19,5,"OK, OK, I was gonna leave out the horseradish thing & use the Dijon stuff, but my other half really does like horseradish, & these potatoes turned out absolutely wonderful! Great, too, as cold little munchies, I thought! Guess old dogs can be taught new tricks, so to speak! Anyway, thanks, much, for sharing this great recipe! [Tagged & made in Please Review My Recipe]"
731353,343801,2009-02-12,5,"Made this over the holidays and will be making it again for my soror's tea party this month.  Wonderful, wonderful shortbread!  Very flaky, just the right amount of salty vs. sweet.  Went over wonderful with my fam and the IL's!  And ridiculously easy to make.  Thanks for posting!"
1680530,100408,2010-09-08,2,"Definitely pay attention to the part where it is written, ""use less pepper if you don't want a spicy taste"".  I mean I like to taste some heat in sausage but If you use this amount of pepper, you'll definitely have a serious ""wake up"" call.  Forget spicy, this recipe is flat out hot!"
2001110668,33489,2016-08-07,0,OMG! KFC coleslaw has always been my favorite dish on the menu but has gotten too pricey. I thought I could never enjoy it again....until now! And wow it is! You can't fool my taste buds...THIS TASTES LIKE THE REAL THING....IM IN COLESLAW HEAVEN FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE!! NO OFFENSE KFC ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
228458,133388,2009-08-16,5,"Well, like FloridaNative my DH said this is absolutely a five--a rare honor from him! I used chicken thighs and drumsticks, and a combination of white and sweet potatoes. I also used reduced fat cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken to compliment the stuffing mix. DH forgot to add the green beans for me (I was working late) so I just quickly steamed them and threw them in at the last minute--worked fine. All in all I really enjoyed this, and will certainly make it again either when the temperature drops or when DH begs for it, whichever comes first :). Thanks, bluemoon! Made for Went to Market Tag."
95743,124195,2005-06-19,5,"For some reason these seasonings, herbs and juice make the peas taste even sweeter. Of course, basil is one of my favorites. Great way to heighten the enjoyment of garden fresh snap peas.  Yum."
46545,16797,2005-08-09,2,"This tasted like garlic, and not much else.  Sorry, but I didn't enjoy the flavor at all.  The cucumber seemed to have gotten lost in the mix and it  would not process till smooth until I added a bit more vinegar (which I subbed for the wine.)  Maybe my garlic cloves were too big or my cucumbers too small?  Maybe it needed a little salt?  Who knows, but I'd be willing to give it another shot if anyone sees what might have gone wrong. "
653438,385157,2010-04-20,5,Cut the recipe in half but I used two green onions and added some avocado slices to the top.  We totally enjoyed these.  Made for SPRING PAC 2010.
26075,150138,2008-03-03,4,This is really good.  I added Tabasco and used Turkey Ham and beef sausage.  We also us the vinegar off of the pickled jalapenos to taste when we served it.
1116035,27144,2009-08-28,5,Awesome cake recipe!  I did cupcakes instead of a bundt cake - I added 1/4 cup applesauce to the mix too - super moist cupcakes.  I did not use the glaze - used a buttercream icing instead.  I am anxious to try the glaze next time.
226863,333238,2010-08-08,5,"This is very easy to make!  I liked it as is, but DS liked a little more sweetness to his, so I added a little sugar and vanilla to his chocolate milk.  I loved that this used things I already had at home to make.  It is very thick once it is refrigerated, so be sure to stir well. This will be great in the winter for hot chocolate. Thanks for sharing!  Made for Photo Tag."
125109,224713,2007-10-21,4,This was a really good soup and very easy to make! The amount of cayenne was a bit overpowering for me so the next time I will reduce the amount of cayenne. The sage butter added a really nice touch to this light tasty soup. Congrats on your win and thanks for the recipe!I will make this again :)
895132,425823,2013-07-26,5,"Another winner cookie from you!! I loved that they aren&#039;t so sweet, just perfect for my taste. The anise and lemon peel is subtle and very fragrant, not too strong, which I also like very much. Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for ZWT 9 / Greece for The Apron String Travelers"
1271914,161370,2009-11-11,1,I expected it to taste like something Jamaican and it really didn't to me. It was not at all  what I expected and it may have been better without the crushed tomatoes.
385423,29679,2009-10-02,4,"This is a good recipe.  I made them as a test recipe at work and one guy tried them as soon as they were set and cut.  He said they were pretty good, but a little sweet.  He then ate another 3 and said to make them more often.  Good thing I made a 9x13 pan.  They seemed to go over well.  I'll be making this recipe again for sure."
2000311117,54257,2015-07-02,5,"Best meatloaf recipe ever!  I also tried making this with 15 crushed low-sodium Ritz crackers instead of the slice of bread and, dare I say, it&#039;s even better.
Thanks!!!"
208171,83800,2005-11-13,5,"This was easy and I had all the ingredients on hand to make it. I made it for a wedding shower, along with several other appetizers. This was, by far, the favorite item! I had a little bit left over & shared it with some young friends (13-21 years of age.) They inhaled the remainder. :-) Thank you for this keeper!"
366904,189860,2006-11-14,5,"Wow.  I would have never thought to combine all of these ingredients, but, wow.  My husband has had to go on a low sodium diet, and with this recipe he didn't miss his salt.  My kids liked it, too, which is an even bigger feat.  We will be making this again and again.  My husband now asks for it at least twice a month."
400633,38041,2008-01-01,5,"I made these on New Years when my husband's and my friends came over to play videogames and ring in the new year. I also bought $15 worth of snacks. By the end of the night, the snacks were virtually untouched, but the cookies were nearly gone! I gave my hubby a big box to take with him to work. At first they were a bit leery, but hubby walked away to greet a customer, and when he returned, his coworkers were shoveling them in their mouths! They were GONE in less than 10 minutes!

All in all, I must say they were a smashing success!"
39835,502534,2013-07-28,4,"Very good and different meatloaf -- which held together very well (which I have problems with sometimes) - our&#039;s was rather spicy, but we picked a spicy bbq sauce and I think ourbacon had some pepper in it too. We cooked it in a loaf pan, added 10 minutes to cooking time but other wise made as directed with some minor changes. Thanks for sharing!"
209747,135446,2006-10-05,5,"Wow! What a fantastic recipe you have. LOVE LOVE LOVE that I usually have all of these items on hand. I tried this recipe on one of those days that I felt awful, forgot to take something out for supper, it is 7 pm and dh is starving! This was PERFECT!  Completely different from anything I have tried before! I did double the garlic- because we dont like vampires! lol and added 3 green onions (scallions). Superb! Thanks for a great recipe! "
336632,48532,2007-02-26,5,"Wow these are the best VEGAN cookies I have ever had and quite possibly the best cookie I've had all around! They taste and look just like that prepackaged cookie dough you get frozen but these taste even better not to mention mine are all vegan. Everyone who tried one did not believe it. I used ener-g egg re-placer, earth balance in place of the butter (which is better for you than butter) and vegan dark chocolate chips. MMM! Thanks for giving me my new favorite cookie recipe for a slightly fatter vegan. I'll make them every month."
67961,107271,2012-08-21,0,Yum! Family loved it.
26290,264079,2007-12-18,5,"Great recipe. Simple to make, delicious to eat. It was a hit at the potluck.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks!"
119956,140681,2006-05-22,3,"This recipe got mixed reviews in my house. The chief complaint was that the brisket was overcooked. I cooked it for eight hours on low and that was too, too long. I may try this again with another cut of meat, the sauce and spuds were good. "
52963,40226,2002-09-23,4,"Halved the recipe for two people. Used an English Cucumber (10inch). Very good recipe, worth keeping, next time will try with chicken tenderloin strips on skewers. Served with a great Greek salad and Greek Green Beans (20612)."
865759,150041,2014-10-28,5,"Super easy and tasted great!!!  I followed the recipe to a T, with the exception of the stick blender, both of my kids loved it (which is rare!)"
844554,71129,2011-09-22,5,"As usual, Kitten's recipe rocks!! I didn't realize how good sauteed zucchini were. I left out the parmesan and it was still out of this world. Will be making this often! Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag Game 2011."
169130,270578,2007-12-12,5,"This is great tasting & so easy. I have been using this recipe for years.  You can use white chocolate chips or peanut butter chips or some of the blended (swirled) chocolate and caramel chips for other variations, too.  I try to make a few kinds, some with and some without the nuts, each year to put into gift tins or boxes.  Makes a great homemade gift and allows for some ""leftovers"" for the family."
78779,88939,2005-08-10,5,This is by far the best chicken we have eaten!!! Every time I serve this the family goes nuts.  I have pan fried and grilled the chicken and it always comes out awesome.  The only thing I did different was use frest garlic instead of garlic salt.  Thanks for the recipe!!!
68928,77570,2003-12-05,4,I made this as instructed and we all thought it came out pretty good.  The sweet and sour flavor was nice and because the pork cooks for so long it literally fell off the bone.  Good recipe!
2198132,518151,2014-08-25,5,Yum!!  Great recipe!!
682603,67245,2008-03-19,5,Thanks for posting this recipe Kate! We had not thought to use icing for s'mores but it tasted great. My 3 and 8 year old girls loved it!
446250,141402,2007-10-02,5,"This was an awesome recipe from beginning to end. Both us adults loved the rare, but it was so easy to cook them a little more for the kids; actually just left them in a semi-warm oven and by time our were finished, theirs were as well. I served them with a homemade cocktail sauce and have alredy been begged to make more!"
573325,434854,2011-11-16,5,"Oh YUM, YUM, YUM! This bread is amazing! It is sturdy yet also very moist, has a great crunchy crust and outstanding taste! The pumpkin and nuts are complemented perfectly by the spices. Mmmmm! I think it's one of the best, if not the best pumpkin bread Ive ever made. Loved it! :) I made half the recipe using part whole wheat flour and reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup in total. That was plenty sweet for our taste. Also I forgot to reserve nuts for sprinkling on top, so I had them all inside of the bread. That was lovely, though and I didnt have to be afraid of them burning in the oven. lol<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this keeper with us, Ceezie!<br/>Made and reviewed for PRMR Tag November 2011."
474448,107440,2008-10-14,5,"This is really good and I will never cook bacon on the stove top again!! I used a baking sheet with parchment paper and than I put a cookie cooling rack on there and all the fat dripped off, it was fantastic!!
Thanks :O)"
1344219,26947,2009-08-06,5,I cooked a batch of this sauce and the meat - a - balls for about 10 redhats. I have had requests for the recipes and have been told by an Italian that I am an honorary Italian now. What more can I say!
192974,101064,2009-10-23,0,This is very very close to my mom's recipe that she has been making every Halloween for 40 years.  She sprinkles white sugar on the cookie sheets then sets the candied apples on that.  They don't stick to the pans and they have a sugary bottom that hardens and makes it easier to wrap in plastic wrap.  I prefer the candy to the candy apples anymore.  There isnt many kids left at home anymore but on Halloween all the past kids come knocking on the door.  It wouldnt be halloween without her candy apples.
766609,96499,2008-10-22,5,"I made this for a soup cookoff back in September and forgot to come back and review it.  Let me just say that EVERYONE came up and asked me for this recipe!  I modified the recipe by adding two 15 oz cans of white Kidney beans and i also added two of my husbands fresh grown cayenne red peppers that I picked that morning.  the soup simmered in the crockpot for 6 hours after I made it on the stovetop.  This soup is another 10 star winner!
And oh yes, I did double the recipe."
937635,22782,2009-07-06,5,"Excellent Spaghetti Sauce! The wine gives the sauce its depth - so it's true about using a good wine. I had a mediocre cab on hand that ran a little sweet, so next time I'm definitely heading for a drier more complex wine. I'm going to try the baking soda trick, too. I wanted to try the recipe as stated first and then try the baking soda since it sounds interesting and personally I can get overwhelmed by tomato sauces. This was a fantastic tomato sauce though - don't get me wrong! My SO loved it!! I made it with Kittencal's Garlic Parmesan Bread and green beans. Yummmm!"
82363,88948,2005-05-14,5,"Like everyone one said, this one is a real winner.  I didn't have the expensive chhese, but the crumbled did well.  My hubby overgrilled them and they were still yummy.  Can't wait to try them cooked correctly."
222564,110189,2006-03-12,4,"Easy, tasty dip!"
242729,295645,2008-10-02,5,Absolutely fabulous! A great recipe that I whipped up easily for lunch today......I seved this with soup and used a sliced French boule loaf instead of baguette. I reduced the quantities for the two of us and loved the addition of the parmesan to the mascarpone cheese spread - I also garnished the plate of crostini with flowering oregano. Made for PAC 2008 Autumn and Oregano Herb of the Month in the Gardening Forum. Merci encore! FT:-)
39949,91299,2004-09-13,5,"Well, now I have a new chili recipe - DH says it's better than his (and he prides himself on his chili!).  I made this exactly as directed, and it was excellent - the spike of lime juice was the ""secret ingredient"", I thought.  I do plan to tweak it a bit next time - will add more jalapenos, some hot italian sausage, and will not cook the vegetables until soft, since we like a bit of crunch in chili.  We also like our food on the spicy side, so will probably add either crushed red pepper flakes or a few dashes of hot sauce.  Also, will let it simmer a little longer than 25 minutes, to really allow the flavors to blend and mellow.  This is a real winner - just add serve with cold beer and cornbread, and it's perfect for fall and football-watching.  Thanks for a great recipe, Ridgely."
1362207,31128,2009-12-08,5,"This pie became an instant winner in my family!
My husband says it's the only apple pie I am allowed to make from now on!
Super super easy, and so delicious. The store I went to did not have the caramel ice cream topping so I bought the caramel cubes and melted them down, sooooo yummy!
Everyone at every family function now asks for this pie!
Thank you so much for sharing!"
1445789,386760,2009-11-13,4,"I didn't read recipe completely till I was in my kitchen, pouring my WHITE 2% Milk, then had to figure out how to turn it into chocolate milk.  I used the 'hot chocolate' recipe on the side of the Hershey's Cocoa Powder and added an additional 1/4 cup cocoa, 1/2 sugar, dash of salt and vanilla (for 4 cups of milk since I doubled the batch).  Overall a great sucess for my first, not-from-box or plastic cup pudding.  I found this recipe as a way to use to milk that was going to spoil.  I used much smaller cups and got 9 servings from a double batch.  Also, used microwave-warmed chocolate chips instead of baking chocolate."
236750,6627,2009-01-17,4,Lovely and moist! I'm sorry but you just gotta have butter and sugar sometimes! Baked it in a bundt pan  for 45 min. Will try the praline topping that someone else suggested. Yum!
166475,58047,2005-07-04,5,"Delicious!  I used kalmata olives, and left out the fresh basil, and sprinkled shredded fresh romano cheese on top.  This would be delicious on a thin crisp pizza crust, dusted with romano.  It would also make a great pasta sauce if you puree it with some more olive oil and tomato sauce."
93006,42091,2003-10-10,4,"Very tasty and so easy!  I may increase the topping ingredients next time, as we like crust!"
27783,71564,2003-11-17,4,"Very good dressing.  I enjoyed the flavor combo of the two herbs in this - very fresh and flavorful. I tried the updated version of this recipe, and the new oil amount worked out fine.  I used egg substitute in place of real egg as I was serving to a child as well - this worked out just fine. "
2001014807,498662,2016-05-20,5,I got so many compliments on these!! They are perfect! I put white chocolate chips once to make my son happy and they were awesome too!!
168319,66121,2010-01-14,4,boys loved it
446523,430331,2012-01-27,5,loved it. it smelt so fantastic when it was cooking. dh thought it was very yummy.  <br/>thanks
610969,117372,2008-09-16,5,So good and easy! Loved it! I made it for my fiancee and his friend and they were done in under 5 minutes! Will definitely make this again and again.
362527,130829,2006-10-12,5,"Great healthy cookie!  I used light margarine, and they turned out great!  My 2 and 4 year old boys *LOVE* them, and I like the extra fiber they get!  I have to limit them or they would eat the whole batch in one day!  Thanks for a great and healthy recipe that I feel good about serving to my boys!"
278516,120326,2007-10-05,3,"We have 400g cans of chickpeas in Australia, so that's what i used. We didn't have any fresh tomatoes on hand, so used approx 200g of canned crushed toms.
We liked it, but didn't love it. I think it could do with more spices/herbs."
353381,115660,2007-08-11,5,"OH MY!!!  Here is my story in regards to Josh's Tilapia.  So my DH & I have been trying to eat semi-healthy.  There was a sale on tilapia at the supermarket.  Bought the tilapia.  Went to the Zaar in search of a recipe, and found this.  Now, I was looking for something good, because my husband DISLIKES fish, but in our pursuits of health, he agreed to eat the tilapia.  AND BOY WAS HE AMAZED!!!  He absolutely LOVED this!  And so did I!  We were wowed!  And since I made this, he has asked for it again!  HA! 

This was very simple to make.  Don't be worried that you don't have an exact measurement for the Italian dressing--it all works out!  I upped the cumin and skipped the Old Bay Seasoning because I didn't have any.  

This is a keeper recipe.  And not only a keeper, but one I would definitely serve to guests!  THANKS!"
65056,61382,2004-12-15,5,"Like Sackville Girl, this was my first time preparing and eating artichokes.  My family used to eat them occasionally when I was small, but I thought they smelled funny and didn't want to try them.  We used water and some red wine vinegar to braise them in, which turned out great.  Good flavor without overwhelming the artichoke flavor.  Instead of cooking the artichoke on low, we tossed them in the oven at 350, which worked great.  Very yummy and you're right- not soggy and not hard.  Easy to do and a tasty treat.  We dipped our leaves in some melted butter, mayonnaise and a little of the braising liquid. Yummy!  Thanks Geema!"
241219,220621,2007-04-06,5,"This is awesome!  What a wonderful way to remember what our Savior did for us!!  Thank you for submitting, we will use this over and over again.  God bless and Happy Resurrection Sunday!!"
70910,17783,2018-02-22,5,"Delicious! I split it in thirds though and only made two portions, using only 2 egg yolks. I also used half and half instead of whipping cream. I strained it into the ramekins. It was like eating silk, so delicious! Thank you for the recipe. I'm sure it's to die for as written!"
1802570336,513010,2014-03-10,5,Easy to make and very tasty. We have them once a week.
600363,33919,2008-08-15,5,"I really liked it. Mine somehow needed more of the sour cream/soup mix, it wasn't creamy enough. I halved the recipe... But still tasted great and looked really good too. :)"
29196,80877,2006-12-28,5,"I had some caramelised onion cooked, a boned 1/2 leg of lamb and no rack, but it didn't matter. I layered the veg, then just placed the butterflied lamb on top amd cooked it all for an hour. I used fresh lemon thyme, added a sprinkling of finely diced pancetta and about half a cup of water half way through the cooking. The meal was outstanding, and I wish we had had guests to share it!"
180898,92354,2006-06-06,5,"Yummy! I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs 'cause I like them better and they are cheaper too. Followed the recipe to the letter except I used fresh oregano since we have some on hand. I pan fried the chicken (didn't add anything extra to the pan) since I didn't feel like waiting for the grill to heat up. This is a wonderful marinade which I will be making again and again. I used this for Cubano Chicken Rice Bowls With Bananas recipe #100380 and think it was perfect for this recipe. Thanks for a great recipe. 
"
769405,98439,2008-05-16,5,"This is an easy and delicious way to prepare sweet potatoes!  I cut mine into rounds, as suggested, and seasoned them with both salt and pepper before roasting.  They came out beautiful and were extremely tasty!  I will definitely be making this recipe again!"
133174,378869,2009-07-14,3,This was a nice list of salad ingredients and made a nice dinner salad.  I left off the cooked potato as I didn't see that it would add anything to the salad.  The dressing is very tasty.  Thanks for the entry and good luck in the contest.
178427,50384,2011-06-22,5,"Oh Baby, Oh Baby, Oh Baby!! This is the bomb! I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I will definitely make this again and can't wait to make some more to share with my friends. Just had corn chips this time but will try it on other things. Thanks so much for sharing this delightful salsa. Made for ZWT7-Pacific Islands."
2362129,117496,2014-12-17,1,The cookies were pretty to look at but I found that the cookies left a bitter taste of molasses in my mouth for quite a while. I won&#039;t be making these again.
273842,23469,2006-11-17,4,"This is great for a quick weeknight meal, my only suggestion is next time I will marinate the chicken a few hours before frying.  Otherwise, very tasty."
14438,23936,2002-05-02,5,I have been looking for a basic simple scampi recipe for ages and this more than fit the bill.  We followed the recommendations for parsley and crushed red pepper which were just right. Next time I think I will cut down some on the butter but the taste was excellent!
252316,127053,2006-05-18,5,"Yummy!!  This will be our recipie from now on, thanks!!  My entire family loved them!"
2001183840,10404,2016-09-26,5,"Very easy and very good. I made a batch for the office at work. Made a batch for my brother and my sister, my niece tasted that and said they were very good. Now making a batch for my on the road coworkers."
2002210067,272740,2018-07-06,5,Great recipe that everyone loves but youâll need to double the recipe (except ice cream) for best results.
35140,229887,2009-03-31,5,"I used puff pastry instead of phyllo, but otherwise stuck to the recipe and it was incredible.  My husband and I ate nearly the entire thing ourselves.  I would NOT leave out the sherry.  It adds a wonderful flavor."
283251,170324,2006-11-25,5,"Holey Smokes!! This is fabulous! I skipped the mushrooms, b/c DH doesn't like them, but followed the recipe otherwise. This was part of our appetizer table at Thanksgiving. I had carrot and celery sticks and a variety of crackers to go with it. The dip was good with all of the above. :) I'll be making this one again for sure! I want to try it as a veggie-wrap with spinach and sprouts for a light lunch too. YUM! Thanks for sharing."
119466,130085,2005-11-30,5,"These are so good! I didn't see 40% bran flakes at the grocery, so I used another brand of bran flakes. Other than skipping the raisins and adding extra bran flakes, I followed the recipe--thanks for posting it!"
324390,287950,2008-05-02,5,"The sauce really makes these tuna cakes! I reduced the soy sauce to 1/4 cup and left out the salt trying to cut out some of the sodium. These are very sturdy little cakes and hold together well. I had a little mishap when I tried to pipe the sauce using the little baggie- it exploded! That was no fault of the recipe however, just a faulty baggie. And I got more sauce on my plate- yum! Made for Aussie Swap '08."
1802512344,103152,2014-02-20,0,"I have made this a couple of times, but since I do not like mayo I decided to swap it for cream cheese, and let me tell you, it is delicious!"
147428,101391,2005-11-26,2,"I followed the recipe in preparing my first brined turkey (13#), brining it for about 18 hours before rinsing it very thoroughly under cold running water.  Other family members thought the turkey was fine, but it and the gravy were much too salty for my husband and me.  Both of us take medications to lower blood pressure (and have sensitivity toward salty foods), which may account for our unfavorable response and negative review.       "
542159,372602,2011-04-18,5,The flavors in this delightful veggie dish that made a nice lunch when paired with whole wheat couscous. Really enjoyed the background flavor from the wine could not get snow peas so used whole sugar peas which were just delicious cooked this way. Thanks so much for the post.
1680722,193358,2012-08-18,5,"I used this as side dish and all loved it.<br/>I did not add butter (even if I know that I would love it, I used little more milk instead) to avoid more calories and animal fats, but the recipe is soo good, that nobody missed it!<br/>Thanks a lot for thei great recipe!"
394077,81698,2007-03-18,2,"Sorry but I have to give this recipe a low rating. I followed the recipe to the T but here are the problems I encountered:  the second layer didn't come to a smooth ball as described in step 4; rather, it was liquidy.  It was so liquidy that I poured the mixture instead of spreading it as described.  After I baked it,  it puffed up to like dutch babies.  Then when cool,  I spread on the icing only to find the icing to seperate after 6 hours into liquid and caused the danish to get soggy."
578353,195106,2010-12-27,4,"Made these for Christmas for a family member that has a gluten allergy, and they came out great...everybody was eating them.  Used Pamela's baking mix and halved the recipe and came out with a dozen large muffins.  They were amazingly good!!!"
125388,118784,2007-05-26,5,Great side dish.  I used red potatoes for the added color.  The garlic adds flavor and the parsley adds color for a nice change from regular mashed potatoes.
108488,26276,2016-07-29,5,"great for those with food allergies.. soy and dairy free. I used regular chocolate powder and it tasted great. kept in the fridge for months.. until the kids found it! for those like me who weigh instead of measure: 300g sugar, 100g cocoa powder"
498271,408755,2010-04-23,5,"This wrap makes a great breakfast!  I used a lowfat multigrain flatbread wrap instead of a tortilla, and lowfat cheddar-jack cheese.

163112,455797,2011-08-03,5,"I love this!!!  Perfect proportions of oats, nuts & fruit.  I LOVE the addition of rosewater to the yogurt...I probably used closer to a tablespoon.  ;)  Everybody should have this on hand.  Made for NA/ME Tag 7/11."
66321,9836,2003-02-02,5,"wish I could give you more than 5 stars for this one...I stirred some cooked rotini pasta into the pot just before serving, and it was an absolute SMASH HIT!!! My bf loved it--broken leg and all, he still cleaned his plate and said "" Honey, this one's a keeper!!"" (That, coming from him, is more of a compliment than you can imagine!) Thanks for this simple and delicious dinner..we loved it !! 
"
340776,291902,2008-05-14,5,"I made this with firstkitchen last night and it was SO delicious! We boiled the chicken and replaced the can of cream of mushroom with another of cream of chicken per my own preference. We also added  little more curry than was called for, and it was absolutely delicious. The curry isn't very pronounced, but gives it a really delicious heat that is way worth a try even if you don't like curry. I loved it!"
1802613073,312842,2017-09-17,5,"This worked out great even though I left out a few ingredients that I didn't have: Worcester, celery, beef broth, and even though I had the tomatoes I forgot to add them. Still turned out great! I took someone's advice and added mixed veggies, and I used soy sauce, beef seasoning and 1 cup of water to replace the Worcester and beef broth. I sauteed onions with green peppers instead of celery. Tasted awesome. Topped with 4 shredded cheeses and used a family sized pkg of garlic mashed taters. Used a 13x9 glass pan because I used 1lb beef and 1lb ground deer. Will definitely save this one, thanks!"
2001359051,202325,2018-08-12,5,"This is one of my ALL time favorites, and it always turns out great. I have used (depending on what is in my cupboard) regular raisins, Sultanas, or dried cherries. It is always delish! I first saw this recipe in Peg Bracken's book, &quot;I Hate to Cook&quot; about 50 years ago. So glad to see it here. I usually serve with a dollop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of home made caramel sauce."

24386,72432,2004-05-06,4,"This is a good way to do a pork roast.  Loved the veggies (especially the eggplant)incorporated into the tomato sauce.  Sauteed the veggies a little before adding tomato sauce and wine, used only 1/2 cup of wine, 1 tablespoon of salt and left out the sugar - those are the changes I made.  Very tasty.  Thanks Rita!"
310156,130256,2008-09-05,5,I made these brownies for my family after they bored of zucchini bread.  I added 2 eggs and 1/2 c. water - but left out the nuts.  So good!
482933,16399,2009-09-11,5,Easy peasy.  Adds lots of flavor.  I also used this before making Recipe#368746.  Thanks DiB's for sharing.
284180,266388,2008-12-10,4,"We enjoyed this for a tasty lunch.  The one thing I'd have changed is the cheese...we thought it would have been better with some cheddar added, or a cheddar/jack combo, instead of the mozzarella.  But otherwise great flavors, and it came together easily for a quick lunch."
2000279377,465258,2015-06-19,5,"I tried this recipe and love it. Although, I used different noodles and had to substitute evaporated milk with half and half and whole milk."
119466,119225,2005-08-27,5,"Very good! I used whole wheat tortillas and think next time I may try leaving the cocktail sauce out of the filling and just serve as a condiment. Thanks, Caroline, for sharing your recipe!"
251223,134061,2009-08-28,4,This was WAY too sweet for me. It is syrup though. Next batch I am going to reduce the sugar. I really loved the addition of the almond extract.
1803121221,461880,2014-09-10,0,"Thanks Cherbear for trying to recapture this old recipe. I grew up with chop suey every once in a while and I remember it well. The only change I would make is that we never used canned veggies, only fresh from the garden We used about a cup of onions, two cups of celery, cup of carrots, cup of green and cup of red peppers, cup of carrots. My mom also added a touch of Worcheschire sauce for color."
832773,338452,2010-03-09,5,"Yum! I made this last night for dinner and it was so simple and delicious. I was searching for something just like this. I had all the ingredients on hand so I was relieved to find this recipe and really enjoy it. It will go into our rotation, thank you FancyPants! :)"
733994,105817,2008-04-12,5,"This stew was so great and easy!!  I used an extra carrot and potato and one celery stalk and only one onion.  We really enjoy the veggies!  When I read this recipe I didn't have overnight so I cooked it from noon until 7:00 pm on high and it was perfect and tender!  Thanks so much, I will definitely make this one of my regulars."
6357,56399,2003-03-17,5,This was very tasty! I really really loved it. I now shop more for bittergourd than for coffee;)
716192,20184,2008-02-28,5,"These are great!  Best granola bars I have made.  My son loved them, next time I will try whole wheat flour.  Thanks!"
58104,132029,2006-09-26,5,YUM! And pretty! I do love this and never get tired of it. I did used double the garlic and added extra oil to help blend it. I served it in a gren pepper that I cut the bottom to balance when filled. Thanks!
246878,12584,2007-06-19,5,I always have a hard time cooking fresh corn. My family has become accustomed to canned corn. But this recipe is very easy to understand. I added some butter to the water and it came out really flavorful.
567219,117532,2007-10-31,5,Great recipe- most homemade pizza dough gets way too thick.  This one was light and crispy.  We will be using this recipe again! Thanks!
193516,166973,2006-07-18,5,Loved this salad!!! I used light miracle whip.  I also used a very small amount of salt and decresed the sugar a tiny bit as well.  I loved the addition of the tomatoes to this salad which you don't ususally see in cucumber salads.  It gave it a very refreshingly different taste.  Thanks for a great recipe!!
178742,27208,2008-02-25,5,"This was one of the very first recipies I found when I joined recipezaar in 2004. And I finally tried it, and I'm glad I did! It came out wonderful. It was not too salty for us.. As a matter of fact, I tasted the mix after I blended it together.. I browned my roast on both sides before I put in crockpot, and i rubbed the dry mixes on both sides of my meat. I also used a cup of water, and my roast weighed 2.22lbs. I cooked it on high for about 5 hours. It could have been 4 1/2 hours, I can't remember if it was 1:30pm or 2:00pm when I put it in. Anyway, it was soooo good and it fell apart when I removed from crockpot. I served with baked potatoes, topped with broccoli, cheese, backon and sour cream. I can not wait make the roast again! 
Thanks for sharing!"
55380,146451,2007-04-16,5,"Cute, easy, and tasty. People couldn't tell it was low fat and had Splenda in it. This would be a great baby/wedding shower or brunch add-on. Thanks so much for posting!"
352768,33946,2006-09-15,5,"Oh...my...gosh!  This recipe is awesome!  My daughter goes to a small private school and each year during Teacher Appreciation Week, the parents cater lunch, so I filled a large crock pot to the brim with this recipe and there was none left; they loved it!  I believe I earned an A+ for this project! "
2001857134,257011,2017-12-13,0,Great recipe! I've made these 3 times. Thanks!

248292,219782,2007-05-11,5,"Wonderful! We love to cook with ground turkey and this recipe is a keeper. I made them the night before for the next day's dinner. When I came home from work my hubby was just taking them off the grill. They turned out very moist, tasty and full of flavor. I will be making this recipe a lot. Thank you PdxBarb!"
1567897,155744,2018-03-20,5,"I shredded the chicken instead of dicing it, and used mozzarella and Mexican blend cheese instead of smoked Gouda (I couldn't find it in my store). Delicious! I will be making this pizza again and again."
337963,98490,2006-10-09,5,"I loved the flavor the majoram added to the corn.  I didn't have any rosemary, so I skipped that."
795578,39087,2009-03-01,5,"Great recipe. It came out great and is very versatile.The only difference was  used macaroni noodles, it was all i had. Next time I think I will add in some vegetables. THANKS."
180898,307405,2010-08-19,4,"My oldest and I enjoyed this a lot. My husband didn't like it at all. Just one of those things. It is so easy to make tho, I may make it just for the 2 of us for lunch once in a while. Also, I never had almond milk before and thanks to this recipe I've found a new favorite; and my Dr said it is very good for you."
95671,48736,2005-12-12,0,What a great way to cook this recipe.  Saves on electricity
162009,95987,2005-12-26,5,"My Hubby and I used to spend every Saturday night at Trudy's munching on chips and salsa and drinking these.  Sadly, we had to move to Houston  and we haven't found a  place that makes a mexican martini that even comes close to this.  Thank You so much Amy, for the memories.        "
540708,239675,2007-07-18,5,This is now one of my favorite bread pudding recipes.
472482,46922,2007-12-28,5,"Fantastic!  sweet and tender.
Great for Christmas or Easter dinner- and leftovers are even better!"
180090,96111,2007-12-22,5,Gotta love this classic treat! Thanks for posting :)
527886,272577,2008-05-26,4,"This is an interesting flavor combination, in a very simple one-dish meal. The quantities can easily be increased for a large group.
The recipe has many nutritional strengths, including a mix of proteins, hidden veggies for non veggie lovers, and an opportunity for whole grains. I substituted lowfat yogurt with shredded coconut for the coconut milk, which greatly reduces the amount of saturated fat, with only a slight impact on the texture. (I also made my own korma sauce, with a similar substitution.)"
88099,176248,2009-08-01,5,Excellent as I love lime anything.  Flavors really blended well.  I only used half of the sugar (splenda) and it was plenty sweet for me.  Used Sierra Mist.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for I Recommend :)
603975,220617,2007-10-20,5,"This meal was fantastic! My chicken did not turn out dry, either. I made sure to pour the broth over the chicken every few hours or so. It actually fell apart and was so tender and flavorful. Thanks for the recipe!"
37449,113034,2005-03-18,5,"I made this using rib eye steak and yellow mustard, my hubby doesn't like Dijon. This made a nice lunch for him and was easy and quick to prepare. Thanks Julie!"
256364,322546,2016-06-20,5,"This was great! The only change I made, due to what I had on hand, was to use Hidden Valley Fiesta Ranch...I think it only improved an already awesome recipe. Thank you!"
2010064,45940,2011-09-21,5,this was a very yummy dish!!!! i did do my gravy a little diffrent then what you say to do after i reed some of the reviews of it being clumpy. i mixed it with my leftover oil from porkchops then slowly added the broth to it. after that i add a cup of water to thin it out a little poured over the chops in crock pot and cooked on high for 2 hours. put i give this recipe 5 stars cause its something my whole family loved
797639,277037,2008-05-10,5,My husband and I LOVED these spicy burgers.  I used sharp cheddar cheese instead and grilled them on the George Foreman.  No condiments needed with these flavorful burgers!
1376400,90693,2009-11-22,5,Used a stand mixer to knead (11-13 mins) and baked in the oven with success. Great bread! It's a little more dense and chewier than the Amish white bread (another bread recipe here) which make it a better sandwich bread IMO. I reduced the salt to 1 1/4 tsp and sticked to the recipe otherwise. I used 2 tsp of fast rising yeast and did the normal twice rising thing. I baked at 350F for 17-18 mins and it's done (my current oven is hotter than the stated temperature).
23119,327990,2009-09-27,4,"Great recipe. I used some red wine because I didn't have beer and short flanken beef ribs, but otherwise made as written. Made for PAC."
704950,116453,2008-03-26,5,"This is great!  I used 4 large skinless split breasts.  I also used 2 cans of artichoke hearts instead of one and I cut each in half so the juice would soak in better.  Didn't have parsley, still great without it. Used a 2004 Montes Chardonnay Reserve so I was very pleased with the result!  I did cut back the salt to 1/2 tsp and next time I will leave it out completely because the salt from the soup is enough."
383346,309759,2009-02-22,4,"I tried this recipe with prosciutto.  We love prosciutto.  But in this recipe, it was not a success.  It was way too salty because it was baked.  And also when we took a bite, all the remaining of the slice was following.  It would be better to chop it a little bit.  I'm sure with ham it's even better.  I'll have to try.  Thanks Jackie.  Made for 123 hit wonders"
1851274,484546,2014-06-03,5,"Healthy, tasty, yummy. New staple in our home. So good."
799308,64375,2009-03-01,5,"This was very good.  I did mess up the recipe however, from not reading well.   I accidentally put on the biscuits and topping before baking for 20 minutes.  Realized my mistake right away, so decided to bake covered for about 20 minutes and then uncovered for 20 minutes more.  It still turned out great.  Leftovers next day were good too and reheated fine in microwave."
124249,103650,2006-06-19,4,"Everyone liked the pancake part of this dish  but didn't care to much for the peaches. It is very easy to make. Going to try it with other canned fruit. 

Thanks LAURIE. 

Bullwinkle."
2000349715,133751,2015-07-19,0,I made this tonight and it came out watery. Any advice? My boyfriend loves teriyaki and I would love to learn how to make it so that we don&#039;t have to do take out. Thanks!
217867,14930,2006-12-28,5,Simple and very good!  These were enjoyed by all.
2001915288,375595,2018-01-06,0,Drizzledwithflavor.com - tried this and loved it!
953113,57042,2008-11-07,5,"This is the bestest, most awesome soup!!  My family LOVED it and we are not typically cabbage eaters!  I can't tell you how happy I am to have found this one!!  Thank you!"
234222,63689,2007-03-05,5,"Wonderful tasting sloppy joes!  I put them in the crockpot and cooked them a little too long, but they were still awesome!  Next time, I will either double the recipe when making them in the crockpot or just make them over the stove.  Thanks for sharing, Hey Jude!"
1169062,351886,2009-04-13,5,"These cookies are simply amazing!  I made them for my office and everyone loved them.
Only difference was I used a three ingredient peanut butter cookie receipe instead of this cookie but did everything else the same.
Seriously D-E-lICIOUS!"
27416,154452,2009-06-30,5,"Hi Cookin'withGas;
I have been on a chicken kick for the last while and trying out various recipes that use chicken legs.  I was delighted with the nice taste of the Parmesan cheese.  I used Padano and it was great.  I also added 1 teaspoon of dried dill weed to the mixture and used Panko bread crumbs, deeelicious.
The baking time was perfect and the chicken turned out so nice and moist, and yes, your Shake 'n' Bake was so tasty.
Thank you for sharing.
Best Regards,
""Uncle Bill"""
241511,18816,2007-01-01,5,"I made this tonight for New Year's dinner as a side dish to ham, black eyed peas and macaroni and cheese.  My husband is a HUGE cabbage lover and said this was the best he'd ever had.  I've never liked cooked cabbage, but had 2 helpings of this.  Next time I'll try adding an onion, but it's great as posted.  Thanks!"
327848,141983,2009-01-13,5,"Fantastic sauce, added fresh broccoli and grilled chicken breast and put it over penne .Plates were licked clean. Easy and quick."
2539662,299433,2012-12-02,0,This is the recipe I always use for chocolate chip cookies.  I live at 7300 feet.  I don't press the dough down too far when I put the dough balls on the pan which helps them not get too flat.  High altitude baking is a challenge!
993604,47419,2009-11-29,4,"Very good on a cold, windy day.  I had leftover mashed potatoes so I put them to good use in this recipe. Next time I may add a splash of apple cider vinegar to the onions while cooking or I may stir the sour cream in with the mashed potatoes.  Thank you for the recipe!"
460101,141814,2008-01-30,1,"These fell apart and ended up as weird hashbrowns. pretty good taste, though."
300721,107786,2017-04-22,5,"Wow! These ribs are amazing! I rubbed them, then wrapped them, and refrigerated for about 24 hours. Cooked as directed, except split open the foil, drained the juices, and slathered with barbeque sauce &amp; put in a 350 degree over for 30-45 mins. Delicious! So tender and juicy! My first attempt at ribs and I couldn't be more pleased. (btw, I used a homemade rib rub I had made before, though never used. It did included the Hickory Smoked Salt, which I bought online as I use it for other recipes. I added the brown sugar to about 3 T of the rub...perfect!)"
169430,178219,2006-11-02,5,"What a lovely change from the usual. I baked one yam for lunch and mixed a generous tsp of honey with about 1/8 cup of good margarine (didn't have any butter on hand)and added between 1/8 and 1/4 tsp of dried mint to the well mixed honey and margarine and left it at room temp while the tater baked. I had a quarter of the potato (it was big) with a good amount of the butter mix with a slice of ham and baby Brussels sprouts. The sweet potato was by far the star of this lunch. The dried mint worked so well I'll continue to use it as it doesn't give the ""Fresh leaf in the teeth effect"". This is a definite GO for myself and the son who will be here at Christmas week. DH can keep his plain white spud! Thank you Lazyme and yummmm."
877347,132263,2008-06-30,5,These were very good! My hubby liked them too. He said they were better than the ones I usually make from the box. I used 3/4 cups whole wheat pastry flour and 1/4 cup all-purpose. I also added a little ground flax seed. I used brown sugar. Yummy!
1244997,384994,2009-08-29,5,"wonderful, moist, & sinful!! the only change i made is used mascarpone cheese in place of the cream cheese) these are truly a chocolate/peanut butter delight! thank you for sharing internetnut!!  =)"
145819,20431,2004-09-19,0,"Gorgeous, mouthwatering, heavenly. Lovely chewy/moist texture. Makes loads! thanks"
496803,388332,2009-09-10,3,"This was all right, but not outstanding.  I liked the flavor, but cut way back on the soy sauce and rice vinegar, only using half of what was called for- and I still thought the flavor was a bit strong.  I felt that the cooking times given were too long- steps one and two only needed a minute or so, step 3 only needed even less than that, as I started with warm rice.  This has potential, but needs some tweaking.  Made for PAC Fall 2009."
456054,10145,2008-01-11,5,"I made this exactly how Brother William said to and it was great.  It seemed like alot of pepper when I first put it in, but it gave it a really nice flavor.  Thanks again this is a favorite."
1433945,31629,2013-01-11,0,These cookies are an old family recipe my Mom always made.  The name comes from how simple & quick they are to make.  She always made mountains of them for Christmas using strawberry jelly.  She added a drizzle of icing (10X sugar mixed with a bit of vanilla) and then a sprinkle of chopped walnuts.  With or without the extra topping and with ANY flavor of jam - these are GREAT!
461724,167881,2008-11-30,5,"This is exactly the way I learned to make tuna salad.  Simple, but oh so good!  Made for My 3 Chefs (. . . Like Mom Used to Make theme)."
230102,94039,2007-12-28,5,"Despite a comedy of errors on my part, this was a great dish!  I wasn't sure about when to add the green pepper, so I stir-fried a red and orange pepper and 3 stalks of celery (I was out of carrots) cut on the diagonal and removed the vegetables before I put the turkey in the pan.  On the turkey, I missed the egg part.  When I realized it, I snatched the turkey chunks out of the pan, stirred the meat around in the egg, re-dredged it in more cornstarch and put it back into the pan with more oil.  While it was very crunchy this way, I would not recommend taking these steps.  On my pineapple, I didn't have tidbits, so I cut up a can of sliced and used it.  The whole thing turned out delicious!  I did add a little more soy sauce at the end and served it over brown rice rather than noodles.  Mercy, thanks for another great recipe!  Husband was thrilled and I will make it again!"
346860,41463,2008-06-12,5,"OK, do I have a use for this stuff.....
I have posted it already as ""Tequila Shot for the Tequila Enthusiast"". It is so, so, so divine... you won't believe it. Take an orange wedge and dip it into this mixture. Bite into the orange as a chaser after shooting your favorite (preferably Don Julio, reposado) tequila. Bye, bye lime and salt!!! Que sabroso!"
2002226766,2886,2018-07-25,5,The best banana bread i have made. It moist. I added some walnuts and raisins. It turned out very good.

212609,261910,2013-05-07,5,"Ok....I have to admit that I had to use &#039;real&#039; eggs, as since moving to OZ I haven&#039;t been able to find egg substitute ( I MUST be looking in the wrong places!!), and I used some good quality pork sausage meat that I had.&lt;br/&gt;I just loved these wee bites, and found them very addictive....a really delicious way to start the day...!!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR"
168423,111734,2006-04-27,4,Finally a cassarole my kids will eat! Easy and everyone enjoyed. Thanks!
54989,19677,2004-04-20,5,"I made this for a dinner party and though I thought it was a little too fat (1 cup butter is A LOT!) everyone just loved it, a couple of my guests even insisted on having a slice to take home for the morning after...! Another great recipe!"
47907,150898,2010-03-05,5,We loved this soup!  It was so easy to put together and cooked up in no time at all.  I also love that it made such a manageable amount ~ i think we have one bowlful left over.  I did change the rosemary for oregano because I don't like rosemary and I sprinkled a little Parmesan on the top of each bowl.  Thank you so much for posting a keeper!
692783,180306,2007-12-22,5,"Great recipe.  I have prepared and tried many and this by far is the best.

Happy Dad"
1191412,33921,2010-03-10,5,"Great recipe, thanks!!! My meat-loving husband had thirds (!!!) tonight... I did the BBQ thing other reviewers suggested, but might try the spaghetti sauce next time. Also used fresh herbs instead of dried and added some grated carrot. My kids have said, they want this 'all the time'. No doubt a future regular  at our dinner table!"
192581,104475,2005-08-17,5,"Made this as a main meal for dinner tonight.  It was absolutely YUM in every way!  Made with a fresh red pepper (not charred or skinned just because that's the way I prefer it), a nicely aged balsamic vinegar and a regular feta cheese (because the unreliable neighborhood store doesn't always carry low-fat).  I also added a generous half cup of sun-dried tomatoes (not packed in oil).  It was sublime!  BTW, this only took me 40 (45 tops) minutes to prepare (even if I had charred and skinned pepper).  Also, cook beans in a large pot as they have a tendency to boil over (I used a 2 quart pot and regretted it).  Great recipe, and big hi to fellow New Yawker! "
114197,28667,2008-01-27,5,Excellent! This also makes an excellent sausage gravy. Just substitute a good breakfast sausage in place of the hamburger.(Like Jimmy Dean or Bob Evans)
41578,90240,2004-05-07,5,"We had a few of our neighbors over last night for assorted coffees and teas and I served this dip with a fruit tray. It was nice to be able to make it a day ahead of time.  What a lovely time we all had and everyone enjoyed this dip.  Thanks so much for sharing this, Breez.
"
2001490075,423225,2017-04-15,5,I lowered the sugar to 1 1/2 Cups and it was even better than the first time I made it. My kids love this and don't even know it's gluten free!
133174,283039,2008-03-02,5,This was delicious.  The recipe was reduced to 2-3 servings and smoked gouda was used.  This was done in time frame indicated and made a delicious brunch.  Thanks for a great recipe.
38182,80085,2008-10-01,5,Oh what a lovely dish this is. I wish I had known of it when I came home from surgery. It would have been SO comforting. It's a keeper.  I am so very glad you shared it. I'm going to send to my 6 sisters - they will love it too.
447123,11107,2007-04-06,5,Just made this. WOW is it lovely. IT had a nice flavor and the family loved it. I added some roasted garlic that I had made and boy with that addition it really set it over the top. Thanks for a great staple to my dinners Davis!!!
1512712,377484,2010-01-06,3,"I received the Barefoot Contessa at Home cookbook for Christmas and wanted to try the Stewed Lentils and Tomatoes recipe. Although, in general my husband and I enjoyed the flavor I felt it was too tomatoey. It took about 30 minutes longer than the recipe to cook the lentils. I used canned chicken stock rather than homemade but I followed everything else to the letter. Not sure why the tomatoes were so pronounced...looked more orange than the picture."
323389,59278,2006-09-04,5,"My kids love carrots, I really should have made a whole pound... 
these turned out wonderful, though I did not get the pretty brown color on them they were still flavorful and soft (but not too soft).  Next time I will make sure I have the time to cook them a litle longer to see if I can get the roasted look."
305346,126611,2009-10-02,5,"This was just amazing! I've made it a few times, each with a couple variations. One time I added fresh basil, chopped roasted red peppers and a vinaigrette instead of the pesto and another time I tried it with a sun-dried tomato/olive tapenade mixed in. You can add so many different things and it turns out great! It's best to make as much as you can because it's addictive and goes fast!"
75846,26370,2003-12-07,5,"I made this cake to use in a tripple chocolate triffle.  It was the perfect foil to the chocolate pudding because of the slight bitterness the coffee added.  I will have to try this again another time and use the frosting which sounds yummie.

2001368410,262417,2017-01-27,5,favorite chicken recipe from my favorite cookbook which I had thought would be lost forever. Thanks for posting. This is dinner tonight!
63128,103152,2006-05-24,5,"Addictingly yummy! I used dinner rolls (round sourdough kind) sliced in half. I didn't have the red onion so I left it out--I can't imagine it tasting any better, though I may add some chopped olives next time."
551470,135756,2007-10-02,3,"Oh my....talk about super rich! :) I did like them though. The thing is, because of another readers comment, I used unsweetend short crust pastry instead of cookie dough and they were still very rich! LOL! I couldn't eat more than 1, but what I did eat, I enjoyed. I recommend using a simple not-so-sweet cookie dough for the cups (or short crust pastry like I did)and only use a little of the cream cheese mixture in each cup. That way, it'll be just right! Great idea you have here shapeweaver!"
88099,181051,2008-06-20,5,We loved this.  The added chili sauce was a perfect addition to my regular seafood cocktail sauce.  I did add a little more horseradish for DH but other than made as is.  Really nice flavors.  Thanks  Made for ZWT4.
53286,953,2002-12-10,3,"Not bad, but I'd call this ""sloppy joes"". I liked it more than my teenagers did."
2001332820,165254,2017-01-01,5,"So happy to find this recipe. i purchased 6 very large Rib Eye steaks for New Years eve, followed the directions to the letter, and they were absolutely perfect. lots of compliments, had to give it back."
74567,46795,2005-01-31,5,"I used 2 cups rice and 1/2 cup mayo, then kept everything else the same. The salad was great, and rolling it into lettuce leaves gives it a great touch. It has great colors: purple, green, and yellow. It has a very refreshing taste and would be a great addition to any summer picnic"
55380,82187,2005-02-04,5,"My daughter requested these for her 10th birthday breakfast, complete with whipped cream.:o) Surprisingly, they were not nearly as sweet as I'd anticipated (I cut the sugar down to 3/4 c, but even apart from that...); I think using coffee for the liquid helped a lot in that area. I got about two dozen 4-inch pancakes. For total decadence, we also topped them with Lennie's Chocolate Butter (#19394). I have a feeling a new birthday tradition is being made ~ thanks! :o)"
60992,369120,2010-05-18,4,I also could not get the potatoes to brown without overcooking them to death and risking drying them out! The flavor is amazing however. I think I would like to try these in foil packets on the grill. I'll just eliminate the broth and use a bit mor butter.
74026,37563,2005-08-16,5,"Absolutely delicious!  I am so delighted in using my garden tomatoes in such a wonderful way to enjoy all winter.  I did make some minor changes. I omitted the sugar and used 1/2 tsp dried minced garlic instead of fresh.  For peeling the tomatoes, I first cored off the top stem, and cut a very shallow X on the bottom of the tomatoes.  I dropped them in boiling water for 30 seconds, then plopped them into a big bowl of ice water.  When they had cooled, I just pulled off the peels very easily!  My family LOVED this sauce!!  Thanks so much for sharing Steve."
978197,426403,2010-06-05,5,"Excellent! Looks great, tastes fresh. (Note: I didn't measure anything, just went by what looked right.) Roasted the pepper because I think this almost always is an improvement. Added hot pepper flakes to kick it up a notch."
355420,216781,2008-07-27,5,"This is THE recipe I wanted to find!  I love the more modern Russian Tea made with Tang and instant tea, but I hate using that processed powdered stuff.  This tastes even better, but still has the same general taste.  It is a wonderful tea when you are sick, or having a Christmas party, or just in the mood for something that warms every last bit of you.  This is definitely a keeper and a new favorite.   Just writing the review makes me want to brew up a pot!"
377581,4631,2008-08-21,3,"I made it as directed. Overall, good, except next time I make it I will add more hot sauce and garlic. Thanks."
247802,354158,2014-02-14,5,"I have made this recipe time and again and it is DEF the best cookie I&#039;ve ever had. Love love love. Easy, delish, soft. Even a few days later."
1953648,34260,2011-07-10,4,"To make sure it thickens, boil about 1/4 cup water and use wire whisk to stir in about 2-3 tbsp corn starch. This will thicken mix."
40943,96988,2004-11-02,1,Neither my kids or my husband were dazzled by this.  I made a pot pie out of the leftovers but the initial chicken was not a winner
4740,94772,2010-03-21,1,I must have bought the wrong kind of marinade. I used Newman's Own brand. Even tried adding more honey to make it sweeter.
39194,66603,2006-10-04,5,"Although I would not consider this ""Italian"" it is a delicous sandwich, and I will make this again with maybe some ham, I used roast beef and some pastrami this time.  I did not have the greek olives and had to use regular black olives, but it was quite good Kim!  Thank you, and congrats, you RedSox lover! :)"
581245,107786,2008-01-19,5,This was outstanding. I recommend letting the ribs sit inside the foil for approx 10-15 minutes after removing from the over and before putting them under the broiler so the juices all soak back into the meat. Delectable!
354540,80482,2014-08-10,5,"Wow! I&#039;m still sneaking this lol! Delish! I made as directed, used almond extract instead of vanilla...added more berries...9x13 pan...wish I had increased the topping...I will make this again and again! Thanks so much Kittencal for another great recipe!! YUM!!"
159145,74046,2004-11-04,4,"Wonderful soup, very similar in taste and texture to the ""Rustic Tomato Soup"" that they used to serve at Valentino's.  I think, though, that I will use more garlic next time.  (My family LOVES garlic.)  I also added about 15 large fresh basil leaves.  Everyone was literally licking their bowls.  I did not not have to strain after blending. Thanks for posting this recipe!  "
143721,232060,2007-06-15,5,"This was an excellent breakfast 
dish.  Thanks to prior comments I 
did some tweaking of the recipe.  
First, I did not have a red chili 
pepper so I used a jalapeno pepper.  
Then I used canned tomatoes and 
included about 2 tablespoons of 
juice with the tomatoes to make up
for the lack of liquid when 
poaching the eggs.  Oh, and I 
cooked on the stove top in a 
skillet. Again excellent dish, 
made easier with the addition of 
the extra tomato juice.  Thanks 
for a new breakfast dish that 
I will make this again. 
Made for ZWT3."
1667251,372992,2016-01-22,2,I should have realised that the lack of additional seasonings would make this bland.  The house did not smell like anything was cooking.  A waste of an expensive piece of meat.
2001727605,2886,2017-09-24,5,It is delicious!!!! I swirled a little bit of brown sugar on the top before baking and it's so good!
386585,335229,2009-01-12,5,"I really enjoyed these scones, and they were very easy to make.  I also really liked the fact that they were cooked whole in a pan and then cut after cooling, as opposed to rolling and patting triangles.  The cakey texture was wonderful and was not as dry as your typical scone.  I will be making this again!  Thanks for posting."
164276,33770,2007-01-10,5,Loved them!!!  I used applesauce in place of the butter and it turned out great!!  Will be making these again.  Thanks!!!
305523,136738,2006-06-12,4,"This was REALLY good! I substituted Splenda for the honey, milk for the heavy cream, and fat-free cream cheese for the sour cream (realized I was all out of sour cream at the very last minute!). Definitely will make again. Even using milk, it was nice and creamy. Next time I'll make sure I have sour cream!"
143721,225435,2007-10-16,5,"OK I made this tonight for my DW and I to split, but my DS and his girl friend came on the scene tried it and I ended up making this recipe 3 time.  I used frozen strawberries and it can be assumed that everyone enjoyed this recipe!!"
993604,390140,2009-11-08,4,I love the combination of orange and chocolate.  These muffins are very moist and have a good flavor.  I used the 1 T oil. The texture was different from what I am used to so I will tweak a bit next time.  I filled my regular muffin pan pretty full and ended up with 13 muffins (12 in muffin pan and 1 in sili-cup). Thank you for the recipe.  Made for Sweet Traditions tag game.
780172,428722,2010-06-26,4,"I did make the crust from scratch and I used whole wheat and white flour mix and it turned out super. The crust deserves 5 stars. I used ground beef and the rest of the ingredients. We felt this would be better without the ground beef, so next time we are just going with the veggies and cheese. Made for ZWT6"
150727,25520,2007-03-18,4,This was my attempt at stuffed shells and I was very happy with the results.  I prepared 1/2 recipe and have some leftover for lunch and a serving in the freezer for later. I sprinkled some extra mozzarella on top of the shells.  I will certainly make this recipe again.
2705149,495271,2013-02-21,5,great
913636,259650,2009-01-26,4,"Delicious - wish I had brought the leftovers for lunch today!  Couple of changes I made we really liked:  added two boiling potatoes (skin on), added a few dashes on onion powder, didn't have any dry mustard so used spicy brown mustard (2 tsps?) and extra Tabasco.  We loved it!"
202829,7984,2005-05-01,0,I found that the mayo was a little too much so used olive oil next time .
465829,18693,2009-02-23,4,"Good snack cake. I didn't frost it, just sprinkled a little powdered sugar over the top. I used my 10"" springform pan and it was just enough. Any smaller and we would have had disaster! I replaced the oil with applesauce, but kept the butter. I also used a touch more cocoa, but just because I wanted to use up the container. I didn't use nuts, so I sprinkled a few white chips in with the chocolate ones. It came out very nicely. The family was split on how they rated it. The men in the family gave this 10 plus stars. 2 of the girls gave it a yuck, and 2 of the girls gave it a 4. So it's got a 4. Thanks! :)"
49360,36751,2002-08-23,5,Magnificent. The tomato hazelnut pesto is the best and a very creative use of ingredients. This was actually very easy to prepare and the results were of restaurant quality. Perfect blend of seasonings. The pesto flavor combined well with the shrimp and pasta. Kudos to the creator. Well done.
308961,93034,2007-05-28,5,A family  winner!  This is moist and delicious with plenty of chocolate but not too sweet.  Love the yoghurt.  This is a keeper! Thanks Jan.
9869,12385,2001-10-28,5,"This was delicious Lennie, the flavour of the soup added was lovely.
I used fresh mushrooms, and served on hot buttered noodles."
956686,14325,2008-09-16,5,"These smell great while cooking, and I have a cold and can't smell much at all.  I used egg beaters, 1/2 cup of soy flour, 1/2 cup of graham flour, the rest white flour.
I also added blueberries to 1/2 the batch.   MMMM"
535489,135272,2011-04-18,0,"This was but I may have put to much butter it came out a little mushy, also I will season it more next time. But I will try it again"
705210,42603,2008-02-19,0,"This was REALLY good! My bf and I really enjoyed the flavour the ranch dressing added. The only difference was that we used chicken breasts, and should have halved them, but next time - we'll know! Quick, easy, and very yummy - definitely will be added to my recipe notebook! :-)"
140331,219459,2013-04-04,5,I added some dried Italian seasoning.  Delish!
39992,8587,2006-11-19,5,"Great instructions, easy to follow. I had a tough time, but it was ME! The first batch I overcooked, the 2nd batch I let cool to long. But the 3rd batch was perfect! Thanks for sharing this recipe. It's a keeper."
1027723,52488,2011-06-18,0,this was delicious! We both gobbled it down. I did add spring onions and garlic and I found it did need it. I also got shot in the eye with some oil.. I also think you definitely need some vegetables to go with it. I would also quadruple the sauce next time! It was delightful!
679953,216431,2011-10-02,5,"What a great lunch.. I did cook the steak stovetop, and added a tad barbecue seasoning to the steaks, other than made as written, definately a winner with the kids, enjoyed this for lunch for the four potatoes.. x  x  x  x wonderful stuffed potatoes.  Made for Gimme 5.."
632657,288854,2009-01-30,4,"Rich and chocolaty! I wasn't sure what kind of milk chocolate to use, I ended up using Hershey ice cream topping, which really put the chocolate over the top...SO Good!!! Made this for Comfort Cafe Jan.'09 - 
Thanks for a delicious recipe :)"
226066,204789,2008-09-29,5,"I enjoyed this and my dbf LOVED this!! Made half the recipe (one apple for me and one apple for my dbf) and used about the same about of ""stuffing"" - mmmmm good!!!  Great healthy dessert!!  Thanks Annacia!! :)"
996911,75653,2008-10-20,5,"In a moment of ""let's-use-what's-in-the-fridge,"" I subbed about a 1/2 c. of leftover tomato soup (simple Campbell's style) for the tomato paste and sprinkled some grated parmesan cheese on both sides of the chicken. I used only 1/2 c. red wine and simmered for 10 minutes (5 on each side).

Chicken was tender, juicy and quite tastey. 
   *I didn't add the spinach because I was trying something else as a side dish, but next time, I definitely will!"
1535,87303,2008-10-06,4,"We really enjoyed the spicy twist to this traditional cookie. I was out of raisins so I omitted them. They were a bit crumbly, but the taste was very good. Make sure you remove them from the cookie sheets within a minute of getting them out of the oven or you won't be able to without breaking them."
169430,352521,2010-05-26,5,"This simple mix sure gave a boost to the Mahi Mahi tonight. I just have garlic powder and onion powder so I added a 1/4 tsp of salt (I made for 2 fillets). Even Hubby loved it, and that's saying a lot. It doesn't coat thickly but it makes a lovely light coating of flavor. I should also mention that I pan fried the fish in a small amount of canola oil instead of the deep frying. This makes a lot too! :D"
17803,95721,2007-09-13,5,Of course this was easy to make.  I used my quesadilla maker therefore I  did not use any butter.  We will make this again.  Thank you for posting.  I made this for the PAC Fall 2997 game.
85528,85782,2007-11-30,5,"This is an outstanding recipe!
It was easy for me because I had all of the ingredients available.
I think my one sister ate most of it.
This dish was so good with our Thanksgiving dinner.
Thanks for posting!"
657658,105080,2007-11-19,5,"This was fast, easy, and absolutely fantastic! I will definately make this again!"
486725,140814,2007-08-27,4,"This was quite good, and packs a lot of nutrition. I made some adjustments based on reviews of this recipe on the Food Network site. I used 1 tablespoon of oil, 2 cloves of garlic, 1/8 tsp of red pepper flakes, and frozen pureed squash to make it easy (zucca, after all, is generic for ""squash"" in Italian). Topped it with some toasted pine nuts, lots of parsley, and a squeeze of lemon. Very yummy!"
243089,27903,2008-04-06,5,"Saw this on the Iron Chef the other day, found the recipe on Zaar and made it last night. This is absolutely delicious (I revised my rating system, so that a 5 Star like this really stands out)! I followed the recipe exactly as posted, but did not have a blender and made the cilantro paste manually. The flavors are fresh and the combination of broth and the meatballs is great. I will cut down on salt the next time since the broth I use already has some. Yum!! Feb 25, 2006. UPDATE (4-6-08): Made the soup many times, and after both chopping cilantro manually, and using the blender as suggested, thought to post the update. Although the meatballs have the same flavor, I find the texture better, and the balls prettier when NOT using the blender.  Blending results in a very fine paste that makes the meat balls very green.  More coarsely (but still finely) chopped cilantro has less uniform and more organic/rustic appearance."
242729,192436,2007-01-23,5,"A very handy mix to have in your pantry - I made the ""mix"" last night & made a cake from it today. I decided on the Spice cake version of suggested cakes - it turned out very well. I changed the measurements very slightly, I rounded the cake flour - Self Raising flour, up to 2 cups; as you can see by the photo, it seemed to work. This was my choice from a recent tag game & I recommend this recipe as a keeper!"
572691,360396,2009-05-30,5,"Spectacular recipe/cake, I had some Garbanzo beans do do something with and this cake hit the spot.  I was very happy with how it turned out and I will be making this many more times in the future, thanks!"
520150,84738,2007-10-25,4,This was pretty good.  Shared it with friends.  A nice change from salad.  It kept for several days in the fridge.  Wonderful way to use up some garden veggies.  Thanks for sharing!
182624,24799,2006-10-30,5,Easy and came out perfect!
209255,222462,2007-09-25,5,"This was a great recipe!  I did make a few adjustments though.  I omitted the onion.  And instead of adding in spices, I added some leftover taco meat from last night.  (I also threw in a couple of other leftovers: 2 pork chops - minced and a bunch of brown beans)  Instead of ground beef, I used sausage meat.  I also used all corn.  Despite all the changes, I still feel that I stayed true to the heart of the recipe.  The method of this recipe is perfect!  The tip about putting the thin layer of potatoes on the bottom is an AWESOME one!  It worked just like you said.  Thank you SO much for this.  This is going to be our standard recipe from now on!"
2055191,116814,2013-02-13,5,This is the BEST recipe for tuna salad...I was seaching and most call for hard boiled eggs.Not a fan of eggs mixed with tuna!!! I followed recipe minus the hot sauce and mustard. This is very tasty and simple to make. Thanks Kittencal!!
2384828,50719,2015-05-04,5,"This is a great muffin recipe which will give you moist, yellow-cake-like, not-so-sweet muffins. 

I didn&#039;t have any cow&#039;s milk so I substituted it with almond milk which wasn&#039;t noticable in the end product at all. I also added a crumb topping (just flour, butter, sugar &gt; crumble together and plop on unbaked muffins) which was really delicious. 

will make again!"
175481,42282,2006-02-13,5,"WHOA! This awesome recipe was such a wonderful surPRIZE! I was out of powder sugar so i needed a recipe asap and I loooove it! Now i wont have to keep forgetting to buy icing sugar i can just use this recipe- it made more than enough to ice my tube cake and it was so fluffy- easy to spread and it stuck on perfect!( lately ive been having problems with that haha ) Even though this recipe has high ratings I admit, i didn't believe it would work but it turned out great! I did end up getting some flour chunks in it but i could just pick them out while i frosted... I also used butter instead of margarine and it was great! Thanks so much this recipe is SUPER!"
736247,29935,2016-12-04,5,"I mixed in a separate bowl and baked it in a 10&quot; springform pan for 70 min (lined with parchment paper), with lots of semi sweet chocolate chips and chopped walnuts sprinkled on the top, as people suggested. It was perfect, everyone loved it. I will drizzle it with chocolate ganache and maybe caramel next time, to make it look even more decadent. 5 stars!"
1583812,88544,2010-03-24,5,"I made a few adjustments to the recipe the second time around - more tomato, more shrimp and less basil.  Its delicious!!!"
24386,116053,2005-05-16,5,"Another good veggie recipe from Pets.  I loved the taste the roasting gave to the green beans and what's not to like with garlic, shallots and lemon zest added?  Only used two shallots and two cloves of garlic...plenty for my taste.  Excellent!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe."
153188,188715,2006-10-12,5,"Fast, easy, and I doubled the recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe."
2001376005,84516,2018-01-22,5,Made it love it!!!!!! Didn't tweak it. Once I find out how many calories I made do some trade outs.
2455272,471979,2012-10-17,5,"I made this soup with a few alterations.  I omitted the beans and mozz cheese, reduced the salt by half and made half a recipe.  This was better by far than the last soup I had at O Garden.  Thanks so much."
176481,229096,2009-03-28,5,"Very good scallops.  I didn't follow the directions and kinda winged-it.  I used regular AP flour, only added the oil and pan seared on the stovetop on Med-High.  At the point when the oil was absorbed, I added some butter.  Seared, turning every minute, for 4-5 minutes total.  Had with a wonderful crabmeat sauce (#240184).  Will be making more often.  Thanks for posting hannahs dad!!"
837979,303108,2008-05-13,5,"I made this last night for dinner and it was a hit for my husband, mom and dad. My dad is a picky eater and he loved it. I didn't use Mrs. Dash's garlic and herb seasoning mix. I just added some seasonings I had around the house and it still turned out great.
Thanks for the reciepe. I'm sure you will get alot of good reviews with this one."
185446,328458,2010-02-12,4,"This is easy to put together and smells great while baking. I wish the cube steaks would have retained their crispy coating better. The texture looked great after frying, but became somewhat soggy after baking. Still tasted good! Thanks, DrGaellon."
780249,69923,2009-01-06,4,"These were awesome! I happened to have a box of lemon pudding in the cupboard, and the recipe's so simple, I just whipped up a batch. Super easy, and different enough to hold their own on the Christmas cookie platter. Soft and chewy. Next time, I might use a little less vegetable oil."
403916,70080,2007-03-22,5,"I just made this and licking my lips from finishing a huge piece  LOL
I too added 1 cup of chocolate chips.  OMG, if you would like something, crunchy, gooey and chocolately,  this is it !!!!!!!   :D"
124249,69333,2006-11-07,4,"A different flavor of milk shake. My husband liked the bits of walnuts. Next time will add a little more ice cream to make it a little thicker. 

Thanks Dancer. 

Bullwinkle."
129201,134757,2005-09-13,5,"Yum!!! Great colour!!! The only thing I changed in this recipe was the size of the potatoes (yes-I used the asafoetida powder!!).I didn't have any potatoes that were small so I peeled and cut three large potatoes into largish chunks. 
This had a smooth and mellowish flavour that we really enjoyed.
A great addition to any Indian meal!"
1588002,34167,2011-04-21,5,"Great five star flavor but a bit thin. Next time I'll reduce the water to 2.5 cups to thicken it up. Ok I've made it several time and I like the 2.5 cups of water better. To make sure it is extra smooth I just add a little of the sauce to the food processor with the jalapenos and onion, just enough to keep them moving. I double the recipe and it fits perfectly in an empty 64oz ketchup squeeze bottle. My family and I put this stuff on everything. A"
350750,43332,2007-05-18,5,Loved this frosting!  Used it to ice some banana cupcakes.
209255,152441,2006-06-27,5,"My Mom used to add brown sugar and butter to her carrots so I do it as well now.  But I had never added ginger!  WOW!  That gives it a delightful flavour.  There is just enough ginger in there that you don't really ""taste"" it, it is just there.  Perfect!  Thanks!"
401420,60096,2008-10-11,5,This was wonderful and something different for my vegetable tray. I bet it would be good on a cornedbeef sandwich! Good job! I'm keeping this one!
56719,3603,2002-10-23,4,What a great recipe.  The sauce was so good and was just the right amount of heat (not too much not too little).  The whole plate was gone!!  I will definitely make this again.
1146233,73724,2009-01-27,5,"I made it today for my mom's birthday and of my gosh it's delicious! 
Everyone liked it and had seconds. I actually diced the apples and served with church strawberry ice cream...yummy!"
599450,503985,2013-07-22,5,"This is so yummy and so easy to make. Even picky DH who doesn&#039;t care for cooked oysters enjoyed this omelet. Thanks, fellow Gourmet Goddess, Pesto lover! Made for ZWT9."
305531,319999,2008-08-29,5,I too chopped the basil and made as directed otherwise. Good sandwich with juicey tomatoes and gooey cheese. Thanks Lainey. Made for I Recommend Tag.
1578775,83445,2010-03-16,5,"My family voted these 5 stars!! I found this recipe in my latest estate sale find.  The 1964 Pillsbury Bake off winning recipes booklet. This recipe was a Jr winner in 1964. The winners name was Jean Nurse. This recipe was all I could find when I googled the recipe, Jean Nurse and Jr winners-Pillsbury Bake Off. Would love more info, if you have it!"
219460,88514,2007-01-05,5,"I tried this for the first time last night.  I wanted to cut the recipe in half so I only used 1 pound of ground meat and I substituted ground turkey for ground beef.  I also only used 2 eggs instead of 3, but I kept all the other quantities and amounts the same.  It turned out really good and I will definitely be making this again for our weekly ""Mexican Night""."
259535,47195,2005-11-10,5,Great tasting and super easy to make. These are wonderful because they aren't greasy with too much salt the way store-bought potato chips are. I lightly coated my microwave-safe container with a cooking spray before adding the potato slices. The chips easily came right out... crisp and perfectly flavored to my personal taste.
508459,151474,2007-07-03,5,Best Cottage Pie I have ever tasted.  Really loved this!  Very easy to make.  Followed recipe exactly except added grated cheddar cheese to top of potatoes which gave it a lovely finish.  Will definitely make this again.
58104,159983,2008-03-18,5,"I used raspberry preserves and skipped the sugar both in the cream cheese and in the egg mixture. This reminds me of my Recipe #151114. This didn`t need syrup but my DH used it!
Thanks V for a great breakfast! Must say French toast is my favorite breakfast."
1072593,278036,2012-01-13,5,"Compared to Sister#2 I've been told that I don't know how to drink.  And ""why"" is it I would want to possess that gene?"
231054,78853,2007-12-30,5,"This was not a good dish for me to make -- NOT since I'm trying to diet!!!  No way could I have just a couple spoonsful!!  These are wonderful.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of celery soup -- they were still excellent.  And if you hate peeling & chopping potatoes -- look for further.  Thanks, again Kitten!!!"
87701,56201,2003-06-22,5,"when I make this for my 2 and 1/2 year old grand-daughter she cleans her plate, I have found I can even add her veges in to it and she doesn't care like her carrots I use carrots matchsticks. She thinks its more cheese I suppose. but she eats every bite, and on occasion has come back and asked for more, please..thanks for sharing."
2678918,199521,2015-04-26,5,I agree elegant but I think mine was extraordinary due to my homemade chicken broth.
269891,9836,2007-11-30,4,So incredibly easy to make.  I served this over egg noodles with a side salad.  Husband liked it a lot.
567219,53874,2008-08-21,5,This turned out soo good! DH said that it was better than the gnocchi we had in the Little Italy district of NYC.  We froze half and ate the other half with tomatos and basil!
192581,114616,2007-01-10,5,"Nice salad, easy to make and very tasty.  I particularly liked the nut and carrot combination, nuts giving it a nice crunch.  I used a no-fat, thick Greek yogurt to save a few fat calories, wildflower honey and 2 teaspoons lemon juice.  Thanks!"
844554,66543,2009-08-06,5,Yummy! I was looking for a way to cook asparagus on the stovetop and this was up our alley. I doubled the garlic and chopped them rather large and added lemon juice at the end. I also left out the oil and used less butter. Next time I'll try it with parmesan on top. Thanks for a great recipe!
535990,131018,2008-01-29,4,This was too easy and very yummy! I did not use onions as I forgot to get them at the store. Next time I will try it including onions and use a little less sauce mine was very messy! I did try the Sweet Baby Ray's sauce very sweet and good. Thanks!
21267,30339,2004-07-11,4,Was my first attempt to make these and it was great! Thanks!
592633,99081,2008-12-26,5,"Great spread!  I made for Christmas Eve and the family and I really loved it!  It was a nice addition to our other appetizers, and one I will make again.  I served with Wheat Thins and Ritz crackers."
1624029,147154,2010-05-29,2,"I just finished making this recipe for a Memorial Day potluck.  The cake part is tasteless, sweet but that's it.  There's not enough cocoa powder.  I used a 1 oz bottle of red food coloring and that was more than enough. I will continue to look for an authentic red velvet cake recipe."
1375473,152737,2010-05-19,5,So simple and tasty but they look complex and elegant! I liked some ground pepper on these although I used feta instead of goat cheese out of preference. (since it is part goat cheese I think?)
24386,108087,2005-04-20,5,This is a real winner of a recipe.  Made exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks so much for sharing.
66008,17014,2004-07-02,5,"I served this to a friend for lunch and we both gave it a definite five stars!! I did use sliced onion buns and just scooped out the bottom for the vegies and put on the turkey, I laid the tomato slice topped by the cheese on the top part of the roll then broiled them. I closed the sandwich after the cheese was melted. This was excellent!! Maybe next time I will try it in a tortilla just for a change. The sauted vegies were wonderful on this sandwich and no dressing was needed. "
1087826,151827,2010-07-15,4,"This was a little bland, but perfect to go with my jerk chicken. I didn't have brown rice, so I made jasmine and I cooked it in coconut milk with jerk seasoning and a little cayenne (then I followed the recipe exactly); it made a great compliment to my chicken! I'm sure we'll be making this again!"
1739723,190605,2013-05-06,3,"too much brown sugar. next time I&#039;ll sub pineapple juice for 1/2 the water. throw some garlic powder or minced garlic wit hthe ginger. used grated ginger.  I used thighs and it was tasty, but a little sweet."
1179225,89207,2011-09-09,5,"Fantstic! So smooth and rich, just loved it. I used milk and 3/4 cup of cocoa. I can't imagine it turning out any better made with cream, but I'll try it next time just to be sure. Thanks so much for posting this perfect chocolate frosting recipe!"
705251,329550,2008-11-27,5,FABULOUS! DELICIOUS! Truly a terrific bread.  The scents in my house smelled like I was baking gingerbread.  The bread baked perfectly in 50 minutes (2 loaves).  The tartness of the cranberries hits you in small bites while you savor the cinnamony and pumpkin flavors in the background.  I made this before Thanksgiving Day and we had it as a dessert because we could not wait to taste it after baking.  Moist texture - slices easily without crumbs.  A perfect bread!  Loved every bite and I'm so glad I tagged it in 1.2.3 Hit Wonders game.  Thanks Kit!
286209,187347,2006-12-12,5,Delicious!!!!! I sprinkled a little feta cheese over the asparagus and dribbled a bit of italian dressing too. This is now one of my daughters favorite ways to eat asparagus. Thanks Rita!
176481,74301,2008-12-31,5,These were very good.  I used a homemade taco seasoning with a bite and a pineapple salsa.  Very easy to do and the end results were a hit.  Will be keeping this for future fun gatherings.  Happy New Year 2009!
2123645,71253,2018-10-29,5,Delicious! I left out the onion and stirred in some scallions before serving instead. Served it with some crusty sourdough bread and it was a delicious meal.
22212,564,2001-10-28,3,I omitted the anchovy paste and used the same amount of Sofrito (a paste for soups and stews used in many of my Latin/American recipes)
27643,27900,2002-09-30,5,"Great tasting cabbage! This was so good. I made it as a side dish and served it with pork chops. Very easy recipe, requires very little work. I think I'll try this with polish sausage cooked right in with the cabbage for a one dish meal. Thanks Miss Annie for another keeper!!"
221694,87440,2008-06-18,5,"What a great all in one meal!  I only had half a regular onion, which I added at the beginning with the garlic. I didn't even add the sugar, and it was still great! This would also be excellent with some tiny shrimp."
472412,10481,2007-09-11,5,Delicious! I will definetly make this again! I love the sweetness! A great way to make broccoli!
250440,40325,2009-01-20,5,"I used this method with sweet potatoes, and they were fantastic!  Soft and fluffly and bright orange.  I did not stand them up on end, just set them in the crock.  Oh, and I sprayed them with olive oil spray before cooking.  Thanks so much for the method, I'll be using it again and again!"
107651,10707,2003-10-23,5,Excellent!! Everyone who tasted this loved it! I used 1 pkg 85ml liquid pectin (Canadian metric measurement) and it turned out fine.  Next time I will add 3-4 jalopeno peppers to heat it up a little more! Great with just about anything you put it on!
146284,174350,2009-03-08,5,"Well, there will be no going back to buying grocery store curry powder now that I have made this recipe!  It has an amazing aroma and flavour.  I took a reviewer's suggestion of eliminating the cayenne, and adding it to taste for individual recipes, added 1 TBSP fenugreek seeds, reduced the cloves to 1 tsp, and added 2 TBSP curry leaves."
623025,83800,2009-12-29,0,"Oh My gosh, so good! Made it last week and have had numerous people ask for the recipee. Easy and cheap to make. I left out chilies and peppers and added alot more olives. Great with tortilla chips or fritos scoops! Oh also I didnt stir eggs in, just used a hand mixer."
246534,27520,2009-01-12,5,"This was a winner. I loved how easy it was to prepare and that I could make it all in one pot (I removed the onions and garlic to a bowl in order to brown the meat and then added them back in). My 2 and 3 yr olds ate it, which is my measure of a successful dish. Thanks for posting."
308765,36702,2009-08-04,3,These were good but too sweet for my taste with the marshmallows and the chips.  I would have preferred the bananas with brown sugar or something.
4439,513329,2014-03-12,3,"Liked the chops, did not love. Next time, no hot peppers, just a shot of sriacha at the table. We thought the peppers were too bitter."
316534,95236,2009-12-19,5,"We actually call this a Royal Kiss, yummy and great by the fire while everyone else is out skiing!"
520150,81048,2008-10-02,5,"Love, love, loved it!  If I knew making gyros was this easy - I would have been making them  years ago.  Would have saved me lots of money & frustration.  This tastes just like the ones I used to buy at the food court when I was growing up.  Perfect.  Thank you so, so much for sharing this.  This is a jewel in my collection."
792558,114392,2008-03-17,5,"Very good pizza sauce.  We were just cranking out some bagel pizzas with some leftover bagels, but had no sauce in the house.  We had everything to make this recipe though, and the pizzas came out delicious!

There was actually a little bit left over and we ate it like a soup; it was kind of like a thick tomato bisque. I would highly recommend this sauce!"
86512,202368,2007-10-14,4,"This was just okay for me. I used baby bok choy.It was a little bland on its own, however, i had it with Recipe #234624. The two dishes went together very well. I spooned some of the sauce from the tuna on the bok choy and it made it taste much better. The sauce complimented the bok choy. If I make this again, I will put butter and some seasoning on it. Thanks for a good recipe. Made for PAC '07"
400708,123579,2009-09-08,4,"This is the first time I've ever deep fried fish and this was so good and easy too.   I didn't have Sea Bass, used Big Mouth Bass and wasn't sure what was meant by spice essence so used recipe#14372.  Other than that followed the directions exactly and it turned out wonderful, brown and crispy - my DH thought I was awesome.  Thanks Denahue for a quick, easy and wonderful meal."
20829,10125,2001-10-23,5,husband thought these were the grandest cookies of them all
37449,95298,2004-07-09,5,"Very yummy! Nice and crisp, loaded with flavor! Easy to make to boot! Thanks so much for this recipe. I look forward to trying it with soup!"
58104,388500,2010-01-13,5,Used only white this was delish. Thanks!
8688,104919,2006-02-12,5,"This makes a wonderful supper.  It tastes like you spent a lot of time preparing, but it is really very simple.  I cut up my chicken breast to bite-sized pieces, peeled my baby red potatoes and I also did thicken the sauce, other than that I followed exactly Marie's directions. I served with Marie's suggested biscuits and some cranberry sauce for the perfect supper.  Thanks for another great supper, Marie!"
17803,309304,2008-09-22,5,I sipped mine on the rocks and it really does taste like a chocolate covered cherry.  I think I'll make a double next time.  Made for *Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup 2008* game
1033400,209280,2010-07-14,5,Delicious and very nice after taste.  Had to add cornflower to thicken the liquid to my liking.  Thanks for sharing.
291188,228817,2014-01-01,5,"This drink was pretty and yummy! Would be a great summer drink! Used Patron, I love kiwi, so it was a hit with me!"
180251,51138,2007-12-23,5,I cannot thank you enough: The best eggplant parmigani by far. My family and friends are still raving. Thank you and what other recipes do you have posted?
58104,187993,2007-05-30,5,"I just enjoy my meats brined. I do it often. This time I chose to do a small pork loin which really doesn`t need to be brined. But it was defrosted and had made other plans to I put this recipe to use. I will remove it after a couple hours because it is a small piece of meat. I also suggest to wash after it is out of the brine very very well and dry. Then let come to room temperature before cooking.
Next day I made Recipe #229276 with the brined pork. Excellent!"
1802542739,61792,2014-06-30,4,"Sadly I cannot report such glory! I really should have read the reviews first! I made the dish to the recipe down pat but my family found it too sweet!  Next time, (once they have forgotten), I shall definitely take into account all the advice below!  As for me!!!  I loved it and they could have just left it all for me anyway!  Thank you!!!!"
358796,55768,2007-08-30,5,"INCREDIBLE! I just mixed it all together. Used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles and was out of jalapenos so just used extra, extra hot sauce (Cholupa). The lime and cilantro and all the fresh flavors makes this just wonderful and heats up perfect for leftovers. Will put this into regular rotation."
1244997,389298,2009-10-07,5,"Made these for dinner this evening. Used some leftover roast that I shredded, sauteed some mushrooms, onion & banana peppers, S & P. I used mozarella cheese. I also made Wolfgang Pucks recipe for homemade pizza dough. After putting together I brushed the outside with a mix of garlic butter & olive oil then grated some parmesan cheese on top. DH LOVED this dinner..Thank You Sarasota!"
653878,9165,2009-01-31,4,Very easy and yummy!  Thanks!!
498271,471567,2012-07-17,5,This is a wonderful recipe for easy-to-make and delicious flatbread!  I made half of the recipe and got 4 large pieces.  I cooked mine in a skillet but would like to try grilling next time.  Served filled with recipe #134682 and some grated Parmesan and really enjoyed - thanks for sharing the recipe!
132419,17586,2004-03-16,5,"This is such a great recipe to build off of !  I tried it as the directions state the first time, then just started adding things I liked, like a small can of green chilis, some fresh red bell pepper, sliced black olives... MMMM it is SO good ! thanks for the great recipe !  My girlfriend is a vegetarian, and I make them for her, replacing the beef with a can of black beans, and she absolutly loves it !"
187373,199360,2012-10-11,4,This was good for something a little different.  I made using greek strawberry yogurt and sugar free strawberry jello. Thanks for posting!
223854,378966,2009-07-09,5,This was delicious side dish with Recipe #211709.  The wedges came out crispy with full of flavour.  I used olive oil but only used half of the written measurements.  Thank you djmastermum
851473,96180,2008-06-01,5,"I made this for my room mates last week and everyone loved it. I also made it for some family who was visiting last night, using bags of mixed berries and it turned out really good."
131126,228870,2007-06-22,5,"Loved this recipe!  It is a very good substitute for bought chorizo and MUCH lower in fat and calories.  It also is full of flavor. I used part of it in recipe #207626 and froze the rest in patties for a future meal.  Thanks Paula! I will be making this again.

Reviewed for ZWT3."
360442,30457,2006-10-07,5,"This was exceptional!!! Thanks for sharing! This was authentic and delicious. I served this along with a bunch of other ban chan (Korean side dishes) at dinner and this was a big hit! Crisp & cool! I could eat this by itself it was so good! Thanks, Jelisa!"
612948,182912,2008-03-02,5,"My mommy made this a few weeks ago, and they were so yummy! We usually just make our own jalapeno poppers with cream cheese/cheddar cheese/bacon, so these were a nice and interesting change from the usual!"
653438,106251,2009-03-10,5,"WOW!  This was a great hit.  I cut the recipe in half and used dried rosemary (that is what I had) and added paprika to the oil, salt and  pepper.  When it came out of the oven I shredded parmesan cheese on top as suggested...wonderful.  Thank you!"
222478,73905,2009-06-27,5,"This was wonderful, the cooking method for the quail helped bring out the flavours and the  dressing was simple yet spectacular and really set it all off. I cooked on a BBQ with the hood down to let it cook through and used a few toothpicks to keep the quail together because otherwise I could see it falling apart a bit while turning. It's a bit tricky to get the temperature right on a BBQ but it would also come out great in an oven placed towards the top for good browning for anyone put off by using a BBQ."
337963,177335,2007-10-13,0,"I made this last night, but I must have done something wrong as it didn't set.  I tasted a bit anyway and it tasted great.  I'll try again. Thanks Jacqueline!"
321227,46925,2009-01-05,5,"We thought it was great,but want to cream the dish more,using an electric wand to mash it more."
146047,55359,2004-07-17,0,"Wow!  Great flavors, and fun to put together.  I won't provide a rating because I did a fair amount of adapting (not due to any perceived problem with the recipe-- just fun to do!).  I used part applesauce for some of the apple juice, and 1/2 c grated Granny Smith.  I also added an extra tsp cinnamon, and will probably add yet another next time I make this.  A shot of soy powder, some liquid lecithin, and barley malt syrup instead of honey/molasses jacked up the health factor on an already-healthy recipe.  After the dough cycle (which I ran it through a few times until I had it the consistency I wanted), I shaped it into a braided loaf, applied an egg white wash, topped it with some oat bran and cinnamon sugar, and baked it in the oven.  Fantastic with soy nut butter, honey, and banana this morning.  Thanks, Geema!"
382532,107064,2006-11-12,5,Great carrots.  I lost my recipe for glazed carrots and this is right on.
118268,30412,2005-03-23,4,These were very good.  I will be making them every St Patty's day and probably several times in between!  Thanks for posting!
88099,137811,2006-01-28,5,"This turned out great. I followed the directions to the letter and it produced a wonderful starter. I let it sit on the counter for 5 days before I fed it for the first time then, after feeding it and letting it sit for 9 hours on the counter, I used it to make Basic Sourdough Bread #34753 and it turned out great. Had a wonderful texture and flavor. Thanks so much Paula for a great recipe.  Update-I have been using this starter since November 2005 and I'm still alive and kicking.  Nothing unhealthy about the starter.  Sorry to dispute your input frankly."
240552,275995,2008-02-04,5,"Yummy side dish!!  I might even add a little extra seasoning next time.  I used frozen green beans and regular potatoes, but other than that everything was the same. Thanks, Lainey6605!"
55729,24088,2006-01-16,5,"I really enjoyed this. We used the water, and I thought that it was nice; cool, but not too cold (it's winter here)."
47510,102089,2006-09-29,3,"This was ok, but not what I expected.  I'm not a coffee drinker, and the flavor really came through in my opinion.  I may try this again, finding something else to sub for the coffee."
89831,125516,2007-01-20,5,"These are delicious! I used ground chicken in place of turkey and added in fresh garlic and some finely chopped green onion, thanks for sharing!...Kitten:)"
140107,68240,2005-06-23,5,it is great with beef granuels sprinkled on it.
803511,428013,2010-06-15,4,"This was a nice light dessert.  I used apriplums (a new apricot/plum hybrid I found, looks like an apricot but has the taste of a plum).  Overall the dish was really tangy.  We added a little sugar to the yogurt and some extra orange juice."
349692,157732,2007-09-20,5,I've also been making this for a few years. Everyone who has it asks for the recipe. I put a can of corn in mine though. It really is good!
22015,194165,2006-12-18,5,These were so easy and soooo good.  I was just amazed.   I will definitely make this recipe again. I found the directions very easy to follow.  Easy dish that just makes it seem you worked really hard.   Thanks for posting! :D
675265,17398,2008-09-30,5,"I think we have a new favorite broccoli recipe right here! We loved the addition of the red pepper flakes mixed with the other ingredients.  Everyone really enjoys this, including my fuss budget DD!"
143318,231169,2008-03-05,5,"The cinnamon flavor with the bites of blueberry, raspberry and strawberry is out of this world! I made the Super-Lite Version (practically FAT FREE) by replacing the oil with prune puree. I used Baker Fat Free Prune Plum Dessert Filling which is by the pie fillings in grocery stores. These were so moist and delicious...thanks for lightening up the recipe!"
146047,106969,2008-02-12,5,"Mmmmm, good stuff.  I love that there's no cream of blah soup.  I added about 1/4 tsp onion powder and a few scrapes of fresh grated nutmeg along with the parsley. I also threw in about a 1/2 c of mozzarella and 1/4 c of parmesan. Tasty, PanNan!  Thanks so much for posting this."
1974537,10744,2011-11-11,5,Fabulously creamy and good!  I used about 1 1/2 cups of all the chopped vegetables and added  more salt and pepper.  The whole family loved it and I felt proud to serve this dish.  Thank you for a winner dinner :)
260689,152620,2009-02-27,5,very easy to make and the kids loved the gravy. I'll make this again !
470351,145355,2008-03-17,3,I give this one a 3.  I seasoned the chicken perfectly and doubled up all ingredients to serve 4 but I found this on the bland side.  Could have used more ooomph.  It was fine...just average at best.  I probably won't make again but had a great base to try new things with.
386585,490148,2014-09-02,5,"OMG - this was out of this world!  The flavors are just outstanding!  I am a huge mushroom lover and this really filled the bill.  I used a pre made thin pizza crust, but used all the topping ingredients.  I found that I used double the amount of the Fontina cheese; the entire 2/3 cup on the crust and another 2/3 cup on the mushrooms. I also was pretty liberal with my white truffle oil.    This packs a lot of flavor and was even better than I expected.  I will definitely be making this again.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
217657,140245,2006-01-16,5,The kids loved these...even my not so fond of fruit 11 yr old boy.  Thanks!
538098,128956,2008-02-04,5,"There is no logical explanation for how GOOD this soup is!  I expected to have to force down cabbage, but it was really enjoyable.  I just had to cook mine for an extra 20 minutes to get all the veggies tender."
279989,202347,2007-07-13,5,"This was a wonderful breakfast enjoyed by the whole family.... I fixed this one morning and it was a breeze to fix... So simple and quick to put together, and then you are able to sit and enjoy your family while it is cooking.... I used cooked turkey bacon in place of the canadian bacon.... Next time I'll try the canadian bacon, we just didn't have any on hand.... The fresh mushrooms were amazing and gave this dish a wonderful flavor.... I also used 12 eggs instead of the egg substitute... Again, it is what I had on hand.... Thanks so much for sharing...."
349991,151563,2009-04-13,5,I made this for Easter dinner with my sister and her family. Everyone said it was the best ham they have ever had. I did mine overnight in a large electric roaster. The meat was tender and the brown sugar and honey made the meat succulent. Thanks for sharing!
130513,56612,2009-02-23,5,"Delicious. Such a wonderful blend of flavors - the not too sweet cake, the sweet and fruity jam, the semisweet chocolate ganache.  Fantastic.  Tastes better after it sits for a few hours so that the jam soaks in everywhere.  I used Ghiradelli  chocolate for the ganache.  Unfortunately, it wasn't very shiny but it was still beautiful and rich.  What a wonderful treat for my husband's birthday."
369715,225133,2007-11-26,4,This was good and easy to make. I made the recipe as directed and I thought it made way more then 4 servings (which isn't a bad thing - just making note). My children really liked it and even ate it cold. Will make again.
788440,47193,2010-06-13,5,"Fantastic Rich and Heart Warming Soup.  Great for those cold winter days.  I've made this several times and it always turns out great.  Only substitute is I didn't use real bacon but turkey bacon (less fat), but it was still terrific.
Thank You!"
201581,191495,2007-06-06,5,"This is heavenly served warm with a dollop of Cool Whip, and very easy to put together. Made for My 3 Chefs 2007, in remembrance of Amy."
146310,79563,2004-12-21,5,I wanted to try a new split pea soup recipe for my DH and I'm so glad I did. he loved it!
2001058930,198901,2016-06-22,5,"Made this almost according to the recipe and it was lovely. A little less liquid, one onion and a small tin of light coconut cream instead of the larger tin of coconut milk. Also substituted masaman paste for the curry powder. Delicious and will go on the 'cook again' list."
209255,96581,2007-06-25,0,"I don't know if I did something wrong or what.  I left it in the crock pot for the 8 hours and I used the lesser amount of water/stock.  And when I got home, it was all mush.  And not very appetizing looking.  To be honest, I didn't taste it.  We ended up getting an invite to eat at a friend's that night.  I will try this again one day when I am home all day so I can check on it from time to time.  I wonder if the cook time is off by a few hours..."
393382,21326,2008-12-24,5,This is the same recipe that we have used for years!  My kids love it and I get raves for this very easy sauce - on - the - side.
68727,28931,2003-05-28,3,"This cake had a good flavor but the final product was a bit dry.  I should have cooked the cake for less time.  Since the instructions said to bake an hour on medium heat and my oven doesn't have a ""medium"" setting, I baked the cake in a 9 x 13 pan at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.  I think that the ideal baking time for the cake is probably somewhere between 30 and 35 minutes.  Possibly increasing the amount of oil in this recipe might add additional moistness to this cake ask well."
222564,293173,2016-06-02,5,"In my records, the BEST TUNA CAKE to the date. So tasty and easy to make. Turns out nice and crispy."
80353,73749,2005-07-03,4,"Very nice pastry.  A little heavier than normal pastry and not as flaky, but a good tender crumb and great flavour.  I used it to make an apple pie for DH and found the rosemary especially, and to a lesser degree the cheese, added a whole either dimension to the flavour of the pie.  I am looking forward to trying this in the Autumn with pears."
164914,49890,2008-11-20,5,these were so easy to put together and tasted very similar to a twix bar.... but better!  I did add an extra 1/4 cup of graham cracker crumbs to the shortbread base.  I also used the full can of sweetened condensed milk instead of just a 1/2 cup.  I also added 1 tes. of vanilla to the caramel once i took it off the heat.  and one last thing.... i added nuts to the caramel too. Thanks for sharing such a great candy treat.
424680,350447,2009-11-30,5,"Very, very tasty 'chowder' which I made with vegetable broth for a couple of vegetarians who were here for lunch! I did use just the 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper & another time might add a bit of garlic, but I'm really not complaining ~ Definitely a keeper recipe for me! [Tagged, made & reviewed in 1-2-3 Hit Wonders tag]"
1352632,191783,2012-10-02,5,"My in-laws gave me a microwave to replace mine that had konked out and I used this recipe to make a 'thank you' cake (since it was made in my present!).  ;)  My kids (ages 8 & 9) actually did most of the work, which shows how easy it is.  All of the chocoholics in the family loved it.  Super easy and fast!  I baked it for 5 1/2 minutes in the 1100 Watt microwave, in case that's helpful to anyone!"
222564,106262,2011-06-11,4,"Nice, but not really fried at all, but rather stewed apples in apple juice. Not unlike apple pie filling, but just better!"
807161,89751,2008-10-20,5,"I made these this past weekend and I must say they were very good.  My daughter loved them.  I have to say, as with most home made cakes they do taste better the next day.  I also frosted them with chocolate butter cream frosting, very very good."
176615,362554,2012-03-17,5,"Good! Simple to make and we loved the gingerbread flavor. Not overhwelming, but nicely spiced. Would suggest mixing the spices with milk before adding eggs to make combining easier. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
52282,62102,2003-06-13,4,"these are quick, easy, and very tasty. i used a vidalia onion. i also used a few splashes of worcestershire sauce and tabasco sauce, and i used the ritz crackers. i served these with creole mustard sauce by sharon123. "
497938,29210,2007-08-26,3,"This was ok but not as good as restaurant food, especially considering the work it takes... I did have to add tons of honey to sweeten it up too, to make it enjoyable, it was way to salty originally. The G. Tso's chicken in the restaurants around here are hot and sweet, not salty. I also would like to warn people, who are not used to cook with hot peppers: My huspand got burned really bad when one of them popped, because he pressed down on them while they were sitting in the very hot oil! So, be careful with them. I am not sure if I should have cut them open or chopped them, it didn't say anything in the recipe so I didn't."
2000520508,9272,2016-10-05,0,"I love this salsa, with changes to salt and sugar for taste preference. However, I found, on a forum, the version of this recipe (Annie's Salsa) that was approved by the original author's local extension office, and there is an IMPORTANT difference. The original recipe calling for 1/3 c. of vinegar was to be PRESSURE CANNED, NOT hot water bath canned! In discussions on the forum, the author states that she was later advised by Michigan State University not to pressure can it but to increase the vinegar and hot water bath can it instead. Following are two links to the aforementioned discussions. http://forums.gardenweb.com/discussions/1946898/annies-salsa http://forums.gardenweb.com/discussions/1960962/annies-salsa-mixbig-hit"

Added more WS, and a little more hot sauce as well as a little soy sauce for a bit more umami taste. Put in chilled beer mugs rimmed w lemon salt &amp; pepper, garnished w celery stick, pickled green bean and a crisp slice of bacon. Then skewered olive, salami slice, cocktail onion, cheese cube over the top! It was a show stopper!"
736607,194995,2008-08-12,5,"I love this recipe, as it goes beyond your standard ""bacon and egg"" casserole.  The croutons, sausage and spinach work well together to give this dish a perky flavor.  I felt the spinach was a bit overwhelming, so cut that in half the second time I made this recipe.   I used Italian sausage, instead of typical breakfast sausage.  Will be preparing it for a family reunion of 14 hungry adults - thanks for a great idea! Viclynn"
1535,104844,2005-05-03,5,My son got one of Emeril's kid cookbooks for Christmas last year (autographed too!) and this recipe is in it. We've used it several times in his recipes. We especially liked the Baby Bam Burgers.
584656,18147,2009-10-30,5,Chicken chow mein is one of my husbands favorite and this one was no disappointment.  I did double the sauce and it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing a delicious and EASY recipe.
2000409172,132263,2015-08-17,1,I made an account just to write a review. DO NOT MAKE THESE PANCAKES! They are so awful. I wasted the last of my oil to make these and I threw them out immediately
149621,135281,2005-12-27,5,Excellent!  My family raved about this.  I can't wait to make it again!  Thanks!
52026,37254,2003-01-09,5,"Super combination! The very best of two worlds; cream brulee and the comfort food of rice pudding! This is addictive! I am a real ""cream brulee"" person, and this variation was such a treat. My daughter made it for HER ""mum"" Me! Thanks for a great recipe!"
335277,196286,2007-02-06,5,"Good hearty meal. About as easy as they come, gets a lot of mileage out of a pound of ground meat AND tasted even better the next day! I will be making this again soon."
402559,107871,2006-12-21,5,I used potato flakes instead of the potato flour and they were absolutely delicious! Very tender and tasty. Thanks for sharing these.

202655,29242,2005-06-24,5,This was just delicious! The chops were incredibly tender and the sauce was so good. I really enjoyed this recipe and will make often! Thanks!
207176,59965,2007-10-10,5,Fabulous-terrific!  I put the cauliflower in an oven-proof casserole with a cover and mixed the cheese into the rest of the ingredients and poured it over the whole thing and then lightly tossed it with a spoon.  Everyone loved it!
23119,407956,2010-01-22,4,Very easy and good. Made for New Kids on the Block.
37305,44289,2002-11-20,5,"I made a variation of this and my family loved it.  Instead of sausage, I used grown beef and we omitted the mushrooms completely.  I used a 4 ounce bag of sliced pepperoni and this worked out well.  I fried my onions and garlic in with the ground beef.  I was extremely suprised at how big this actually gets!  We are a family of 6 and I thought no way would it be enough, cause we always have to order 2 pizzas.  Well, this gets as high as the baking dish, so there is a lot of volume here.  It is very tasty and appeals to all ages.  Thanks for a great idea that is ecomonical and quick for a large family!"
192965,65760,2005-07-05,5,"Simple and Very good, I did add Provalone cheese. You can never go wrong with filet."
199848,414251,2012-01-23,5,"Terrific and easy.  I made this as written, just added sliced onion and used sliced portabella mushrooms in place of shiitakes.  The sauce was perfect; not too runny and not too thick.  I loved this with the tofu, but if you have meat-lovers, you could easily used chicken or pork or fish instead.  Happy Chinese New Year!  Thanx for sharing!"
869184,375292,2009-07-17,4,This was a nice change from regular ground beef burgers. I liked the feta cheese and parsley in them. Made for Photo Tag.
53959,131094,2006-01-24,5,Yummmmm.. the garlic adds a great touch. Even better then the restaurants potato skins. 
516341,50639,2017-03-12,5,This spice rub is good on all meats! We especially like to rub a pork shoulder and cook it in the crockpot with a lot of onions and garlic and a little orange juice. The rub is fantastic on pulled pork!!
92886,145025,2005-11-28,4,"I wasn't sure if I should actually rate this, because instead of preparing the chicken as directed, I used leftover cubed turkey.  With that in mind, I think I would have liked it even more if the spinach mixture was mixed with the mayo mixture.  I say this because after I dished it out for dinner , the leftovers mixed together in the dish and when I came back to it later on I liked it even more!  I did use light mayo, light sour cream and half of the parmesean in the interest of calories."
54678,49232,2003-04-05,5,I am actually rating this recipe on behalf of my 11 yr old daughter who made this for breakfast today. And we all agree that is was great french toast. She may have to set up her own cookbook because mom is always sending her recipes and glad to see her trying them.
130819,48463,2005-05-23,5,This flavorful soup made for a delicious lunch. We loved it! I found it  tasted terrific even  before subbing the saffron with a touch of turmeric! Saffron is now on my shopping list. Sprinkled some fresh chives on top and enjoyed! Thank you for sharing. This ones a keeper.
291378,141789,2007-08-29,3,"I don't like pork chops that much, but for a pork chop recipe, I did like this more than normal.  I have to make chops once in a while since my hubby likes them, and this recipe is a good one for keeping them more moist."
174096,355182,2009-04-16,5,"Delicious cake!  It was my first time creating a layer cake, so I must confess that it was certainly not perfectly designed, but it was very tasty!  I used black raspberry preserves, as I could not locate red raspberry without seeds at my grocery, and I was properly chastised ;) by the directions in advance to avoid the seeds :)  It worked quite well- all of my guests loved it and asked when I would be making it again.  So it sounds like I will have plenty of opportunities to practice making it look as good as it tastes.  Thanks for sharing!"
107583,204495,2007-01-16,5,"Reminded me of an Orange Julius (not as sweet, though).  I used soy milk.  Very refreshing after work!
Thanks for posting this one!"
742778,350559,2013-12-24,0,"This is a family favorite for us! Every time my sis is home from HI we have to have it. For my family I substitute cooked, crumbled bacon for the sausage. Wonderful!!"
276718,83678,2008-07-15,4,Really good ribs!  Falling off the bone good.  I didn't apply the last coating of dry rub because it just looked like it already had so much on it and I'm glad I did.  The rub is good but the sauce is excellent.  I will definately make these again and will double the sauce - it really is that good.  I used Splenda brown sugar mix and it tastes great but we are used to the Splenda taste so I don't know if others would agree.
2635733,133851,2013-01-15,4,"Delicious! Used Coconut Flour, Amber Agave, and Coconut oil in place of what the recipe calls for. I also added some unsweetened coconut shavings inside the batter.  Turned out soft and chewy at the same time as being crumbly. Half of the carob brownie heart gone in only 1 day."
52448,143976,2006-01-09,5,"This was succulent, gently spiced and crispy! The crust sfayed on and turned a deep golden color. The frying took approx 20 minutes per batch. Great recipe!!"
201581,433146,2011-02-10,5,I made half the recipe and this is pretty good for a lowfat version. I love cauliflower anyway so I was not put off by the sauce. Thanks for posting Chrissy. Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag.
37449,232384,2007-08-21,5,"Oh, this was so nice on a hot, sunny day! I used lemon-lime soda in place of the champagne. Thank you Bev!"
21752,372610,2009-06-04,5,Really simple yet delicious.  I used all fresh herbs and instead of the pepper flakes just tossed in a chopped chili.  The kids were not too fond of the olives and picked them out.  Adults scarfed it down.  Thanks for a recipe I can now play with.
901883,77738,2008-08-20,5,I too found this recipe on Betty Crocker. I used a big cassarole dish and cooked it in the oven instead. It was great but there was to much cake/pie filling ratio and would cut back to 3/4 or even half the cake and just cook the rest seperatley for a pumpkin cake ala-mode for those who don't like apple. You could even use that half with another pie filling flavour.
747394,87794,2008-02-03,2,"Good and easy.  Added LOTS more cheese to thicken and add flavor.  Also used an immersion blender to make smooth and creamer.  I only had spicy brown mustard, so I used that and gave a good spicy flavor to compliment the amber beer.  This was good, just a flavor that I didn't care for."
570625,84030,2010-09-24,4,"Quite tasty!  I didn't make this ahead & freeze, but rather all in one day.  I did add a can of black beans (drained) and about a cup of frozen corn (rinsed/thawed) into the chicken mixture before layering.  One thing... the rice did stick to the bottom of my casserole dish so next time will oil spray first.  Tasty comfort food!  Can't wait to make it for a work Potluck. Think it will be eaten up quickly!"
111313,108830,2005-01-21,4,Made this last night to good reviews.  My DH didn't care for the cranberries ( i loved them).  I think the next time I would use a little less mustard it overpowered the sauce a little.  Great mixture of flavors.
871792,32618,2008-06-24,0,"Amazing!!  My whole family enjoyed these... not an easy task when your feeding a family of 5.  I used a store sauce and added my own extras.  They are very easy to make.  I fried because it was too hot to bake, but I do think baking or broiling would be easier.  Yummy yummy.... don't make these for a party unless you don't mind making them for every pot luck you get invited too!!"
2001783108,113914,2017-11-08,0,This cake always hits the spot! Completely eases that chocolate craving
29196,102712,2004-11-09,5,"I didn't see the instructions regarding the size of these, so I just shaped them into 8 plump burgers. They had quite a crisp outside where the feta had browned and were really moist and juicy inside. The olives, feta and herbs gave them a really delicious flavour.
I used mint and oregano rather than the Italian herbs, as I thought that would give them a more Greek flavour."
211184,358923,2009-04-05,4,Moist and very tasty. I doubled the raisins since we love them. This recipe looks as though it could be halved successfully as well since often 2 loaves is just too much for us. Thanks for sharing. *Made for Spring PAC 2009*
92805,31049,2004-06-27,5,"mmmmm,so good!  added fettucine on the side and words can't describe.  a little time involved for a easily distracted cook such as myself but well worth it.  i used more of the bread crumb mixture than recipe called for and added lots of garlic!  thanks!"
210245,98447,2008-06-19,0,"Good muffins 2 year old loved them. I did'nt have raisins or nuts, but cant wait to make them again with those additions. Very tasty!"
65502,380941,2012-02-23,5,Breakfast for supper is always a hit in our house. This dish was perfect! I didn't think it would but the toast did actually cook in only 10 minutes. I doubled the recipe and also used 8 pieces of thick toast for the 4 of us. These were enjoyed by all of us! Made for Went to the Market tag game. Thanks I'mPat! :)
1328927,290060,2009-07-20,5,"I made this for myself and it was absolutely delicious --- even better then the Panera version! I was slightly dissapointed, but that was only because our panini grill couldn't handle the mammoth sandwich I put on it...!Thank you so much for making my favorite so much more accessible!"
240001,82102,2006-10-15,4,"This was very very good.  The reason I am giving 4 stars is because after 45 minutes, I saw that the crumb mixture was a little too soft for my liking.  I removed the foil, and put it back in the oven for 10 minutes.  The crust became a little crunchy and brown.  It was delicious.  My fiancÃÂ© adored it.  It was quick and easy.  Thank you for sharing."
302094,91009,2007-12-17,5,"I made this the other night and it was very good. I am rating this 5 stars because my 2 year old will not eat any meat, veges or fruit. I stirred the gravy in the mashed potatoes so he would have to get some meat. He ate every bite. Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!"
414666,25489,2007-07-22,5,this was an awesome recipe
2000836975,295087,2016-11-01,5,"So I wanted a snack for my family after dinner and came across this one. I did not have cranberries because I don't really like them, so I used 1 cup shredded apples in the filling with the lemon juice and accidentally used 2 Tablespoons of Country Crock and about a tablespoon of cinnamon and a handful of raisin in the dough. It came out weird shaping, but it looked like a W for my last name, so I did not care. It tasted AMAZING!!! And it was not too sweet. It was like an apple pie on the inside with crumb topping on the outside. My husband and son dove in, myself likewise, while it was warm and ate it with butter. That was last night. Right now, it's morning and I'm having another piece(my third collectively) with some coffee. Yum! Baking is not about perfection, it's about creating something delicious from the heart while putting your personal touch on it."
452699,25370,2007-03-24,5,Very tasty and easy to make.
1604552,18200,2012-08-12,0,"This bread was good but I wouldnt go as far as giving it a 5 star rating. I didnt have fresh basil or oregano so I used dried. It was good my family loved i,  but bottom line I have had better homeade italian bread"
133174,61726,2005-07-17,5,I needed a quick way to fix canned black beans and found this recipe.  It is very quick and easy.  Loved the combination of spices.  Served this with Chicken Fajitas with Grilled Peppers and Onions #128504.  
369715,422005,2010-06-04,3,These were OK for us. We didn't think they had much flavor to them. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I crushed a bouillon cube in about 1/4 cup of water and added that and that gave it more flavor.
479756,224425,2012-08-21,5,This was wonderful.  I moved from town and favorite Mexican restaurant and I find this hard to find in restaurants here.  So I am slowly finding recipes to fit the bill. Thanks for posting!
161265,157456,2007-01-10,5,"Oh Yummy!!!  I didn't have any coriander and I couldn't find the ground mustard to save my life...and my ""boys"" will NOT eat avocado (but I do!  YUM)...but other than that, I didn't change anything!  :)  This was such a huge hit, I'm still stunned.  DH is easy to please...but DS (7 yo) is picky at best...and not too into eggs.  Well...let me tell you... he INHALED this.  Then asked for seconds and asked if we could have it again for breakfast the next day.  He talked about Mom's Special Cheese Sauce all day long.  Hehehe.  Thanks for a definate keeper!"
1803503752,106641,2014-12-14,4,"My TIPS for this recipe:  made two batches of this to give as Christmas gifts and wanted to offer some feedback. I found that in using a spray oil on the cookie sheet that it left a film on the bottom of the toffee, so I had to blot each piece with a paper towel. On the first batch, I scored into the toffee, but only part way. When inverting the pan to release the candy, it broke into irregular shapes so I just went with that. Also a Lot of the nut topping was displaced. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So on batch #2 I scored deeply into the toffee, and also lightly tapped the almond topping into the chocolate after sprinkling. Once again, the toffee just broke where it wanted to though so I have no clue what the point of the scoring is. That WAS helpful to pat the almonds into the chocolate so they more readily stay put (but a Lot still come loose when inverting). I also decided to add 1/4&quot; tsp. of almond extract to the toffee mixture, something I often like to add to recipes. To me, it &quot;cuts&quot; the sweetness a tad and definitely adds to the finished taste which is yummy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also -- since it was bizarrely missing from the orignal recipe -- the baking pan I used measures15&quot; X 10&quot; and was the ideal size. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Will I make it again [someday]? ....Yup. Thx. Juju Bee, as Almond Roca is my elderly mom&#039;s favorite so I hope she gets a kick out of this homemade version.af"
96796,234914,2008-11-08,4,"Very good recipe that delivers a lot of flavor and richness but really isn't too fattening (how often does that happen?).  Also, I thought this was going to be time-consuming, since it requires three different pots/pans; however, it was surprisingly simple to put together.  The only change I made was to substitute tomato puree for the passata, which I couldn't find at the store.  Thanks for posting!!"
53932,258528,2008-03-04,5,"Oh wow!  This is so very, very good.  The sauce is wonderfully flavored with the garlic, basil, anchovies and wine and the calamari  perfectly tender."
2087633,86055,2011-11-30,3,needs a bit more sweetness...
1211385,52366,2011-01-26,4,"This was pretty darn good! I had to substitute basil for the coriander, and curry powder for the turmeric (we were out of both), I cut down the cayenne by half, as well as the salt. The seasonings were delicious, and the only drawback was that we all felt like we had been pepper-sprayed when the plates hit the table - not a major drawback, and in fact quite funny to watch :)   We will definitely use this again. Thanks!"
135566,5483,2012-02-11,5,Loved this dip.  I added 3 tablespoons of maraschino cherry juice that I needed to use up.  Served with both fruit and sugar cookies.
593780,109547,2010-02-09,5,Amazing!  Moist and delicious!  Added some vanilla like others suggested.  Thank you for posting!
2000431901,185648,2016-10-23,4,Really good and really easy. We re-hydrated dried onion for a softer smaller texture.
88047,95843,2005-05-15,5,"Wonderful--A simple, delightful sauce that makes eating this dish a nice change of pace from the usual garlic butter or lemon I usuually do. A keeper!!"
47907,389229,2010-02-28,5,Oh Sharon ~ this salad is divine!  It's so simple to make and the flavors are just wonderful.  I made as posted except I left my olives whole.  I used regular mozzarella that I cubed.  I would recommend using a good olive oil.  Thank you for posting a keeper that I'll make often!
28177,340656,2011-03-12,5,"DD (4 yrs) and I really enjoyed these carrots.  So easy and something she can help with always means she is more apt to eat it.  I had to use dried dill, as my fresh didn't look so fresh anymore.  :(  But I'll be making it again with fresh next time.  Thanks for sharing, Messiejessie!  Served with your Microwave Tilapia (recipe #340837).  Made & enjoyed for Spring 2011 Pick A Chef. :)"
452355,476719,2013-03-13,5,"This is a really lovely roasted vegetable recipe!   We really enjoyed the onion/beet/butternut combination, and fresh rosemary was the perfect seasoning.  After chopping the veggies, the cooking and cleanup were a cinch.  I served as a side to Recipe #338332.  Thanks for a great side!  Made for Photo Tag Spring 2013."
185446,136629,2007-06-08,4,"I liked the salad, but be sure you know who you are serving.  I have found people either love or hate sesame oil's pronounced flavor.  Unfortunately, there were both types at our table, and reactions were extreme.  I personally loved the pepper flake's added kick."
2001613763,104881,2017-07-05,0,"OohOoh Good! If you are not adding the water or your sauce is too thin...you are not simmering for long enough - I boiled mine for a good 25 minutes, cut the boil to a simmer and cooked it for 3 hours. Had to add more liquid twice, I added chicken stock I had leftover. If you don't like it so sweet you could add prepared mustard 1/8th of a cup and only add 1/8th of a cup of maple syrup, or 1/2 cup of catsup and 1/2 cup tomato paste. Came out thick and smoky, ribs were tender and I received raves."
199792,298184,2008-05-18,5,This is so good. I may need divine intervention to stay out of the leftovers!! It is tart but yummy tart. It is magical how the lemon custard ends up in the middle of the chocolate. I used Oreo crumbs and the crust was a bit chewy which was nice. My husband thought it was too tart but I overrule and give it a healthy 5 stars. Thanks for sharing your excellent recipe.
424680,218687,2011-06-08,5,"Followed your recipe right on down, but did use a half cup of diced dried apricots (the optional dried fruit) & then initially served them with some apricot preserves! DELICIOUS, without a doubt!  Will certainly make these again! [Made & reviewed in Healthy Choices ABC recipe tag]"
88378,328874,2009-12-21,4,"This was a nice shrimp dish with flavor and tolerable heat.  There were a couple mixed reviews around the table.  My seafood-loving son found the panko in the wine sauce somewhat off-putting.  My husband thought the overall dish just wasn't up to par against other shrimp we've eaten (we tend to eat a lot of shrimp) and he thought the sauce was a little sharp.  I greatly enjoyed the dish as did my 8 year old.  I probably won't repeat, though, due to the entire family not loving it.  But as a garlicky, wine-infused shrimp dish, this is a good bet."
429104,72307,2008-10-28,5,"i used chopped chilies instead of whole, fat free half and half instead of regular, eggbeaters instead of eggs, and a 1 pound mexican blend shredded cheese instead of the two 1/2 pounds (basically a pre-sold mix of jack, cheddar, and maybe asagio or something). used the tomato sauce and flour as called for.  not sure how i could lighten it up anymore than that.  DH's cholesterol is high, so i'd like to use less full fat dairy than i have been lately but i think this wouldn't survive that.   it survived everything else nicely tho.  very yummy and quick to prep!  thanks."

145352,336292,2013-08-04,5,"This was just so good. I wasn&#039;t sure about the sauce, but it really worked well. And the marinade on the chicken was outstanding! Made for ZWT."

I have made it a few times... HUGE hit with my boys!"
108681,41511,2004-02-29,5,"This is a delicious and comforting soup. It would be good without the dumplings, but is even better with them included. It is mild, but very flavorful, and pleased everybody in our family, including the kids. Thanks for posting this, Canarygirl!"
740247,466362,2014-04-14,4,"This was very tasty &amp; easy to make.  It had a very strong pepper taste, which was almost too strong for my taste, but my DH &amp; DD didn&#039;t seem to mind it.&lt;br/&gt;Made for Spring PAC 2014"

55406,59289,2004-04-19,5,"Excellent! I made the meatballs by mixing Jimmy Deans sage sausage, ground sirloin, egg, garlic, bread crumbs & mayo.  After browning, I added them to a couple jars of variety spaghetti sauce in the crock pot.  Next day at work, I made the spread & put on steak rolls, built the subs and melted the cheese in the microwave.  Even the brattiest guy asked the next day for leftovers.  I heard him bragging to someone about the meatball sub.  It was awesome!  Thanks for the great idea & super recipe - the spread is what carries it over the top!"
2002246503,39903,2018-08-13,4,I tried it and it came out great but I just came here to see how many people would say that they made the recipe but then proceed to explain how they changed everything about it ( thereby making it a completely different recipe).

1376912,47326,2009-09-07,5,"Paula Deen may have appropriated this recipe, but it's not hers.

This is a common take on the gooey butter cakes that have been passed around the mid-west for years.

Needless to say, it's a great take on a good recipe.  The BASIC recipe has the same 'cake' part, but the top is 1lb powdered sugar, 2 eggs, 8 oz cream cheese, & 1t vanilla mixed on high (with hand mixer or blender) for 3 minutes, then poured over the top.  With this 'basic' formula you can make no end of modifications: add chocolate chips or chopped candy bars or firm fruit (blueberries, strawberries, apples-but add spices with this one) or whatever else your heart desires!"
55773,87748,2005-10-12,5,very nice sauce...garlic and frozen ginger ended up being a little course so I strained the sauce before using...Ran out of corn starch so substituted with flour/water...Will use this again...
482376,468155,2015-02-08,5,Yummy salad and dressing! I love the lemon with parmesan dressing. I chose to use romaine lettuce (since I&#039;m not a huge fan of arugula) and the pine nut option. Thank you!

64203,51537,2006-06-26,5,"I used this crust to make recipe #52356, Strawberry pie. It was so nice to have a homemade crust without all the rolling out mess! The crust was a bit too salty for our taste, so next time I'll reduce the salt a bit, but other than that it was perfect! Thanks for sharing this easy and delicious recipe!"
184530,144437,2006-03-17,5,"We really enjoyed this!
The spices sounded like a lot - and we love spicy food - so I cut the chilli powder to 1 tsp and the pepper flakes to a 1/4 tsp.  The blend of spicy yet sweet was just right and the consistency was perfect, coating the shrimp nicely. I used orange marmalade jelly, topped the shrimp with toasted sesame seeds and served them on basmati rice.  Yum!  And one pot cooking to boot!  As Dollface65 suggested, adding broccoli should work well.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
166475,25962,2005-09-04,4,"Pretty good.  I would next time broil the top a couple minutes to get it brown, and add some sugar to the peaches before putting the topping on."
83436,199869,2008-07-15,5,One of my kids' favorites--I use less onion and usually add a tablespoon or two of sugar!
455312,45115,2007-03-14,0,"I found this recipe online when looking for a weight watcher friendly recipe for some ladies coming to a weekend retreat.  I figured I would post it to help others and found that it already existed on this site.  The only difference I saw on the other site was to make sure you spray the crockpot well with cooking oil before assembling ingredients.  I thought some might also want to know that it is only 6 points per serving...with the lean ham, that is.  I am a little afraid to make it for the retreat with the mixed reviews, but definately think using the diced frozen potatoes would help eliminate the hashbrown's disappearing act.  You could even buy the ones that already have onions and peppers mixed in to save time.  If you don't care about the Weight Watcher point value, try using whole milk or half and half, Owen's sausage in the Hot variety (does not seem hot when mixed in a breakfast casserole) and use shredded sharp cheddar...also try a seasoned salt mixed with the potatoes and also in the egg mixture.  Keep in mind that when you take the lid off a crockpot during cooking, it takes 20 minutes to regain the heat and increases the cooking time.  Resist the urge to peek unless it smells like it's burning!"
354224,51072,2008-11-15,5,"Absolutely Amazing! I used fat free half and half and light butter, and I cannot tell the difference. Great taste and easy to make. My five year old daughter help make it and she suggested less pepper next time!"
1103387,68201,2008-12-30,5,This is an easy recipe that tastes great.  Modifications don't detract from the foundation taste in this recipe.  I used jarred roasted red peppers instead of pimiento and celery instead of green pepper.  Still had that perfect old tyme corn relish taste that I remember as a kid.
348926,171309,2011-04-23,5,"Yummo!  I was looking for a light version of Mac and cheese and stumbled across this one.  I did make a couple of modifications, but the flavor was great.  My modifications included making a roux with flour and butter (3 T each).  While making the roux, I put in dry mustard (1 TB) at that time, instead of using wet mustard later.  After combining everything, I ended up baking it at 375 topped with Panko bread crumbs.  I question the nutritional information, because 1/6 of what I made (including butter/cheese and panko) has the following profile (according to the Living Cookbook): 243.9 cals, 13.4 g fat, 17.8 g carbs, 12.2 g protein and 0.6 g fiber.  This one's a keeper!"
2000202631,339780,2015-05-13,0,This recipe makes a good bread but I followed the it to the tee and it is not very schlotsky like. It&#039;s harder and chewier. Also the recipe indicates to beat the (batter) dough and you will burn out your hand mixer this way. I&#039;d suggest a kitchen aid with dough hook.
199848,175489,2009-04-10,5,"I used leftover cooked rotini pasta to make this and I think it's a perfect way to transform lefteovers.  It's kind of like mac and cheese, but the garlic kicks it up.  Thanks for sharing."

Will definitely be making this one again and again!"

I used some sliced new potatoes,fresh thyme from the garden and amix of Cheddar and Gruyere.This was totally delicious.This will definately be made again in this house.Thanks BlueMoon."

I then followed the instructions otherwise to the letter.

I have to say, this was totally excellent!  

There were 3 of us there, and there wasn't a drop left! 

I served this with garlic and herbs mashed potatoes and home made Italian herb bread.  It was fantastic.  

I'll be making this often!"

494867,126988,2009-05-03,4,"I love the idea of grilling figs, and they turned out very tasty. The only thing keeping me from giving this five stars is that the other veggies on the skewer really didn't pick up the flavor of the marinade and thus didn't have much flavor (other than their own, of course). I think that next time I might salt and press the liquid out of the eggplant, then marinate the whole skewer. The citrus dressing made a nice toss for the salad but I might steal a portion for brushing on the veggies. I really enjoyed this recipe. Made for Veg*n Swap May '09."

My buns remained mostly round, only slouching down to sort of egg-shaped, lemon-sized primitive weapons -- hard-shell exterior and dense. Like me. They were &quot;edible&quot; thanks to the good ingredients. I'm writing this post to say that it doesn't stop with this batch. Maybe you can tell what I did wrong based on the results. However, I BELIEVE the glowing reviews that accompany the recipe, and will give the process another earnest effort within 10 days. I'll do a follow-up review, too."

1179225,331874,2011-12-29,5,HUGE hit here! I browned my potatoes a little before adding the onions and broccoli and used cheddar cheese. It came out a little salty as Mrs. Delishis mentioned. I would cut the salt back to about 1/4 t. next time. I made it early in the day and popped it the oven when DH got home from work. He fell in love with this casserole. I think I might make this for breakfast and top with poached eggs. Thanks for posting this delicious recipe.

We will be making this again!

Great quick recipe to throw together for unexpected visitors! I thank you for sharing this gem Kittencal and so do my children!!!!

After all that I top them of with a drizzle of velveta sauce, then finishing them with some grated chedder cheese.  Pop these bad boys in the oven at 400 degrees for 5 minuets.

Any tips on what I should have done differently to not get those flecks? If you ate around the flecks they were great.
Update:10-13-09
Made these again two days ago. Found the recipe at the site mentioned above and found there was a difference in that one and in this one. There should only be two PACKAGES (or .5 oz) of unflavored gelatin. That is why they came out so lumpy last time. They came out great this time! Will be making more for our vacation."
65056,87090,2004-11-11,5,"Hi, just updating my review, since Ekives was so nice as to revise the recipe in response to my comments!  :)  ORIGINAL REVIEW:
This is a very nice and simple way to cook rice. I actually used brown rice, so I extended the cooking time to take that into account, but otherwise followed the recipe. I know this is supposed to be a Brazillian recipe, but we actually served this with Thai food, so I used unrefined peanut oil as my vegetable oil. Sauteeing the rice gives this nice flavor and ensures that you have nice seperate grains in the final product as it seals in the starch (I presume that this sauteeing is why this is called ""burn"" rice?) You're not kidding about the water bubbling violently when you add the rice. I was expecting it, but it still gave me a fright! Now, I think this is a very good recipe, but I feel that I do have to deduct 1 star, and I'll tell you why: In step 1, you don't specify how long or until what point you should fry the rice. Should it be golden? Golden brown? Brown? Just til fragrant? I did mine until light golden brown, which seemed to work okay, but I don't know what is correct. Also, in step 6- I would like some information on what stage the rice should be at. I wasn't sure if it should be fully cooked, almost fully cooked or what? Mine was just about done- all the water was absorbed, but it was still a smidge damp. Seemed okay. I just wasn't sure if the letting the rice sit covered was supposed to be part of the cooking process or what. I found it really neat that the rice is cooked with the lid ajar- this is something you would never do in the Asian style of cooking rice. Rule in Asian cooking is that when you're making rice you put the lid on tight and *do not* lift it! So, this was a very neat change, and I would definitely like to make it again. I think that glitter's suggestion of adding some fried onions sounds nice, so I might try that next time too! Thanks for the recipe, ekives! This is a very nice change from the usual way of making rice and just about as easy! I do want to note that I chose this recipe for Pick Your Chef Nov 1-29 2004! :) â posted Nov 7, 2004"
176615,215821,2013-07-15,5,"You can&#039;t go wrong with KAF recipes! Between the large amount of Dutch process cocoa, semi sweet chocolate chips, and 1 t espresso powder (in the original recipe), these brownies packed a heavy chocolate punch. The texture was perfect, not cakey. Next time I might adjust the chocolate factor, using milk chocolate chips or regular cocoa to dial them back a notch for my tastes. If you like deep dark chocolate flavor, this is the recipe for you! Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
2002190659,62012,2018-06-18,3,Use the juice and zest of a half or whole lime instead of the wine for an amazing flavor boost.
123584,38041,2004-02-08,4,"Very good cookies, I had to add more vanilla and salt after I tried the first batch.  I found them to be lacking something otherwise.  They do make great deal of cookies!"
911375,53874,2013-01-30,4,"This is by far the most successful gnocchi recipe I've ever tried.  They really are pretty light.  The dough came together easily, and I did use my mixer (judiciously), finishing incorporating the flour by hand.  One thing I did do was cook then riced the potatoes onto a baking sheet and let them cool, so they'd be less water-dense.  I think this is a keeper."
1474883,401732,2010-12-28,5,Really enjoyed this recipe. Made it per directions. Very simple....very good.  :)
2000162903,250212,2015-04-24,5,gr8 m8 i would r8 8/8 would bake again
29196,56719,2004-09-12,3,"These ribs were quick and easy, but only OK for flavour. I was thinking they would be stickier, but I don't think that could be acheived with the short cooking time. They needed longer to make them tenderer too. We added garlic, chilli, and 5 spice powder which I think improved the flavour, and I would have liked more sauce to go over our rice."
573544,18914,2010-02-20,4,Great stuff! I used it on some leftover hamburger buns and everyone loved them. Thanks! EDITED to add:  I had some of this leftover and added it to some alfredo sauce (out of a jar).  YUM - it gave it a oomph of flavor and an added richness.
369715,483229,2012-10-02,4,"We liked these but thought they needed more seasoning. Next time I would add more onion and garlic. I didn't measure the cheese, I just added it in."
142658,18725,2010-03-28,4,I have made this twice now - because my dad absolutely loved it the first time I made it. I thought the chops would come out more tender  - but the flavor was great. Makes wonderful gravy  - so definitely make some mashed potatoes to serve with this! I used the condensed french onion and put it through my mini food processor then added the cream of mushroom soup and gave it another whirl. That way  - there were no onion pieces in the gravy!  Used some fresh grated parmsan on top. I will make this again for sure - just have to figure out my cooking time to make them come out tender!
54697,104248,2004-12-10,5,I can hardly wait to show my husband this little trick.  He eats an egg every a.m. that he nukes in a little plastic thing designed for the microwave and half the time it is overcooked.  The one I just made was perfect!
442301,121490,2008-06-01,5,"This is one of those recipes that you just need more stars for. It was very easy to make. Looked great out of the tin, smelt amazing and then of course the taste was out of this world. I would not change a thing. Although it definately is more like a cake than bread. But I am not complaining. Yummy, thank you."
300755,46780,2009-12-11,5,This was incredible! I made this for my boyfriend's family on Thanksgiving and they were all over it! My boyfriend doesn't really like sweets but he said it was wonderful! thanks for sharing =)
440660,37548,2008-12-29,4,The flavors were really great! I don't think I beat my cream cheese enough because it was a little lumpy.  I'll have to try this recipe again.
237330,264598,2008-03-27,5,This is a wonderful roasted chicken recipe...one I'll make often. The herbs and seasonings are just right. I used a whole cut up chicken and left out the browning sauce. I cooked it on low for 5 hours and could probably have done it a bit less. The meat was falling off the bone tender. Thank you!
662323,53405,2009-03-01,4,"I felt like theses had too much of a baking powder taste to them. They were pretty tasty and all, even then, but that taste just kind of lingered. I would recommend adding some sort of herb to it. Nonetheless, it was super simple, and the result is a beautiful biscuit. Thanks for this recipe, it's a good basic for sure."
943439,322647,2008-09-03,1,This cabbage was real bland and not much flavor.
400708,27777,2011-10-30,5,"I got mixed reviews on this, DH and I LOVE it - the apples came out perfect and it puffed up so pretty, the DGSs who are NOT adventurious when it comes to food felt the batter was to eggy - so I'm wondering if for kids like them I could cut the eggs in half, add some baking powder and still get that lovely puff effect.  For me it earned 5 stars just for the ease of prep and how pretty it turned out.  I made it all in my cast iron skillet (8"" I think) and it was the perfect size.  If I can get this to turn out for the kids too it'd be the perfect holiday breakfast when we have a lot of company"
1474012,287338,2011-03-05,5,I used this recipe to make an ice cream and cake birthday cake.  It worked great with the cookies and cream ice cream and fudge sauce!
29196,428753,2012-02-10,5,"This was so very good! I used a VERY light ""butter"" and red capsicum (yellow are very expensive and slow sellers here). I made all the sauce for the two of us but will use the rest on a pheasant I have in the freezer.  The spinach was delicious as it wilted under the chicken breast. Thank you so much for posting!"
1802080805,250325,2014-01-08,0,I used a  pork roast and the hot recipe. Total failure. It does not resemble JD sausage in any way. It has the consistency  and taste of a hot  spicy peppery pork chop. I added additional fat  from bacon and coconut oil and increased the flavoring. NADA. Edible but JD? not even close. not sure why.
37449,9272,2002-04-17,5,"I have made alot of salsa, and this is excellent. 
I couldn't find my cumin, and didn't have fresh 
jalapenos,so I used some pickled and it still 
turned out great! Thanks."
37036,47422,2005-10-19,5,"Wonderfully rich sugar cookies!  I'd say these are ""bakery quality""!  I like the richness that the butter and brown sugar give to the cookie.  It's slightly crisp on the outside, but soft on the inside - which is perfect in my opinion!  I made large cookies and the recipe make 2 dozen.  I baked at 350F for 10 minutes.   I'm so glad that I picked this as one of my Pick-A-Chef recipes!  This recipes is definitely a keeper and will be made often in my house!  "
288218,194263,2007-05-02,4,"Very good pudding! I used basmatti rice that I already had broiled and halfed the ammount. Here, we now that as rizogalo (milk and rice in Greek) but we are adding the sugar during the boiling. I also added  icing sugar at the topping! Made for PAC Spring 2007! Thanks marycate for sharing!"
212801,75437,2006-01-10,5,"I made several batches of this punch for a party and it was a hit!  Super easy, yummy, and potent.  Guests asked for the recipe and have made it for their parties as well."
22015,19094,2002-10-03,5,"This is good.  I can't compare it to any other English pub mustard as I haven't had it before, but I do like the flavor.  Had it on a ham and swiss cheese sandwich."
226863,69065,2008-10-16,4,This was an interesting combination.  I think it would go very well with a pork roast.  It would be nice in a Hawaiin Luau type theme.  Made for Bargain Basement Tag!
919796,82827,2010-05-12,5,"After eating these for 4 days straight and not getting sick of them I can officially say these are AMAZING!!!!!!!!  I did omit the raisins, and made my own pumpkin pie spice by doubling what my pie recipe uses.  Thank you for the best muffin recipe I have ever tried!"
966037,1005,2010-01-04,5,Loved the pizza dough.  It was easy to make and absolutely delicious.  Think I may have to commit this recipe to memory because I plan on using it often!
231448,25348,2012-07-09,5,Wife and I loved it - restaurant quality
1250047,154926,2009-04-25,5,This is a great recipe and supper quick.  Rather than a loaf pan I used a Mini muffin pan to make bite size muffins.... They tended to stick but they stayed moist for days.  The Folks in the office loved them.
31558,17576,2002-03-15,5,"This Steak Pie With Cheese was SO, SO nice! Full of flavour and I added some kidneys to it. Most definately a 'keeper' for me!!!! The first and only Steak pie I'll ever make, I'm sure!!"
1071797,370123,2009-11-01,5,"We didn't have enough blueberries, so we made it with pineapple. The cake and topping had a great flavour, although i think it would have been better with blueberries instead of pineapple!
great recipe!"
2001117940,16716,2017-01-01,5,These buckeyes are delicious and so easy to make! Thank you. I made them for Christmas and I am going to make another batch for New Year's Day.
203823,41463,2006-03-10,5,Great! I needed some for recipe #121031 and this was  the solution. I didn't have a container to store it in so I was glad to find a recipe that didn't make a ton!
191979,24614,2005-02-06,5,"Wow, this made my superbowl party GREAT.  The best chili I have ever tasted.  The only thing I added was ground cayenne pepper because I love my chili HOT."
6836,71142,2006-02-06,5,"Excellent, easy & delicious - what more could you ask?  I made this for Sunday supper using a 3# chuck roast.  I also liked the easy clean-up since the pan is lined with foil.  The meat does literally fall apart ... it will make for yummy sandwiches for a quick supper during the work week.  Thanks for posting - I will definitely make this one again! -M =)"
1510041,128679,2012-03-11,4,"This was pretty great!  We had all of the ingredients on hand, which is a big plus for us.  Next time we'll probably add some chili powder or red pepper flake to give them a little bit of a kick.  We're also going to double the marinade to have some extra for basting.  This is definitely a keeper."
1604396,323143,2010-10-02,2,"To quote my boyfriend, ""They're taste like sugar-coated biscuits, only blander.""   The texture isn't right and the end product is very bland.  The cookie itself has almost no flavor and the splenda/cinnamon mixture on the outside doesn't supplement it sufficiently."
889069,204535,2008-07-12,3,it was dry not rich
972011,84504,2016-11-23,5,"Even my dh who is not a sweet potato fan LOVES this casserole! When I asked what is the must have for Thanksgiving, this was the consensus!"
309526,9108,2009-01-30,5,"We loved this!  I made it exactly as written except that I added some little balls of fresh mozzarella (which really didn't add much.)  I'm planning a rendezvous with the left overs around midnight (just in case I don't have time for breakfast!) Thanks Richard!  UPDATE:  It was a five star recipe before, but I think it may be off the charts now!  Taking a cue from other reviewers, I used dried basil instead of rosemary in the dressing as well as balsamic vinegar and a handful of grated parmesean / Romano cheese blend at the end.  But what really kicked this up several notches was Ciabatta bread from the new  bakery in town. Oh Mama!!  I hope I have enough left to serve at dinner!"
25063,72055,2003-12-26,5,"I made this for Christmas dinner, it was delicious! I was surprised how little was left.  I used cornstarch to thicken it a bit because I tripled the recipe.
I also added a sprinkle of dill weed for colour.
Thanks for this great new way to serve carrots."
115048,22389,2006-04-19,5,"This was deeelish!!!I served it on Easter with ham steaks on the grill. This would be great for a potluck, I highly recommend you try this you can use whatever veggies you like.I included snap peas and they were perfect."
265956,244592,2009-09-19,5,As always these were perfect and exactly what I was looking for! I can't wait to make them for company. Thanks!
230102,647,2008-09-18,5,"This turned out great!  I sent it with my husband to a Monday night meeting and it was gobbled down.  The recipe didn't specify pan size, so I used 9 x5.  The loaves weren't too scant, but I will try it again with an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 and see if I like it better.  I also used granny smith apples.  I think next time, I will look for a not so tart apple.  We just bought some ginger golds at Costco and they are really delicious.  I think I'll try them!  Of course, I used the full cup oil and it was wonderful.  Had to leave the walnuts out because I didn't have them, but will have them on hand for the next time.  Mine was done in about an hour at 325 degrees, but my oven runs hot.  Time also might change if I use a smaller pan.  Marg, thanks for another great recipe and also for the specific baking time and temperature that you use!"
2001916364,188327,2018-04-14,5,"These fries are genius! Delicious, fast and easy and just as you said, crispy on the outside and soft inside. Thank You! Keeper recipe."
37449,4178,2007-10-25,5,"My sister turned me onto this recipe years ago. It is a great, inexpensive recipe that we have grown to love! So glad to see you have it posted! Thanks!"
363055,302512,2008-09-23,5,"I have made these twice and am just getting around to rating them.  They are very good.  My two favorite things, chocolate and oatmeal.  I used Smart Balance 50/50 Butter Blend and Splenda Brown Sugar and they turned out just great...could'nt tell any difference.  Thanks for a great recipe."
2001154696,81781,2016-09-04,3,"I'm in the process of baking move right now but I have my doubts! I've made Lindy NY style cheesecake lots of times but it's been a few years and I lost my recipe. I amn trying this one out but it is a little different. I renege the filing being way less liquidy when I made it in the past, I'm very worried that this won't actually firm up. I definitely didn't need to scrape the bowl for the filling to into the spring foam pan, it just poured right in. Is that too liquidy? Please help."
151744,284201,2008-08-21,5,Best BBQ Sauce Ever !!!  I made the BBQ sauce and there is not much left.  It is a little bit on the sweet side. Next time I think I will use half the sugars in this.  My family loved it.  I also added this to spaghetti... Delicious.....
111678,122138,2006-10-15,5,"I just love fruit and greens together, and oh, this was good!  I used mixed field greens and was out of celery seeds, but everything else was just as written.  Loved it!  The dressing was incredible.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks for posting!"
614455,71893,2007-10-13,5,"We loved this!!  I didn't have tarragon, or heavy cream; I used evaporated milk and did without the tarragon.  Also used provolone cheese, didn't have any Swiss.  I will make this again!!"
632143,97573,2009-11-10,5,"Really good recipe! Easy, very tasty and easy to modify. Thank you!"
271119,209237,2007-02-12,5,This was great!  My husband loved it!    I only used 1 can of cream of celery and served over chow mein noodles.  It was enough for two for 2 meals.  Thank you so much!
2001263249,101954,2016-11-23,5,Could not have turned out more perfect !
413880,222027,2007-09-21,5,"These are so good and a different flavor of cookie!  Since I have already eaten 2 warm ones, I know that my family will like them too.  Thanks for a simple and different recipe."
1035419,345861,2010-01-02,5,Very good and easy to make. served with tortilla chips for a small New Years get together. Loved it!
440324,77854,2010-04-03,5,Eggcellent!
155091,69270,2005-09-11,5,"I can't believe it's not apple. Wow! What a pie very good. The next day it was really hard to tell it was zucchini, it absorbed the darker color of the spices so it looked even more like apples. I also used the oatmeal crust #26205. But watch the oven temp. and time as overbaking will make this crust hard. But it was very good. Will make again when the zucchini starts to take over the kitchen."
283804,291609,2008-04-29,3,"Very unappetizing to look at, but tasted pretty good. Make sure that you don't add more heat than you can handle - we used medium salsa and it was almost too spicy."
1116537,81676,2009-04-17,5,Grate! Did it with my 9-year-old son. Recommend to do it for every one. Easy and delicious.
174096,321651,2010-05-17,5,Great topping!  This really dressed up the hot dog nicely.  I used the optional cheese and jalapenos.  The flavors were great!  Thanks for sharing!
141293,208530,2007-02-16,5,"This is a very good recipe.  It is simple, quick and delicious.  The trifecta for a 5* reveiew.  Perfect served with steamed rice."
2002277636,141983,2018-09-17,5,
1287895,152347,2009-06-05,5,Very sweet and fragrent.
841981,68955,2008-06-27,5,"well, i love it so much that i ate 6 out of 8 drumsticks in 1 sitting. What more can I say?  Thanks!"
470799,34499,2008-09-18,5,"Good & easy. It does take a while to cook, so you need to plan for it. My family loved it & ate all of it. Thank you for sharing."
209152,29493,2010-03-20,5,really easy and really tasty.
68112,54398,2003-03-26,5,I made these last night for dinner and they were fabulous! Thanks for posting!
324017,376557,2011-02-28,4,"My wife said ""perfect!"", but I found the chicken a little bland.  The next time I use this recipe, I'll add a teaspoon of Italian spice to the breadcrumb mixture,  Yes, there this recipe is a keeper.  The sauce and ""pasta"" were very good."
899881,3779,2008-07-22,0,"If you want a bland, basic, never been changed sandwich this is it and this is why they only serve this recipe in Philly. For the historical value. Make the changes, green pepper, roasted red pepper, olives, garlic, pepperoncinis. Now you have a cheese steak, but it won't be from philly :("
4470,17326,2006-06-17,4,  Tasty sauce but my chop seemed to dry a bit rather than become fall off the bone tender.  It did not dry out completely so I still had a very enjoyable dinner.  I will make the sauce again to have over rice.  Cutting the recipe back to one chop may have affected the cooking time (1 hour).  I covered it while in the oven except for the last 15 minutes
86072,11406,2003-12-16,2,This just didn't work well for me. It came out too dry and wouldn't cut into nice squares; it just crumbled. Maybe I did something wrong!! Thanks for sharing.
302094,98705,2008-07-06,5,Absolutely wonderful! The only change we made was to bake the ribs for 2 hours instead of 3. We will be making these again for sure. Thanks so much Amanda!
15521,359559,2011-11-13,5,"Delicious!  Next time I would add the peas towards the end.  Mine lost their pretty bright green color.  I would also add 2 jars of artichoke hearts.  I thought 1 might be close to 3/4 cup, but I would have liked more.  Other than that, everything was perfect!  I don't have a Buca di Beppo near me, but I will be enjoying this dish at home!"
336058,230533,2007-08-06,4,"These were flatter pancakes, and took a little longer than usual to cook up, but they were good, as all my kids ate them.  I used some regular and some maple MOM, so I reduced the cinnamon to 1/2 and left out molasses (personal pref.)  I was glad it took powdered milk and water, as I was out of milk!  I also added some flax and oat bran and next time will add 2 T protein powder.  Might add a couple T of oil too."
119956,204682,2010-03-08,5,"I made this recipe with prepared stuffing mix. It made 12 nice sized ""muffins"" that we well liked by all ages. The leftovers were used to make meatloaf sandwiches. Any recipe this easy will be made again in my house!"
431813,307684,2008-09-18,5,"Perfect!  Is there any better combination than sugar, lime and vodka?  Will make this often.  Thanks diner!"
640718,117496,2009-11-22,5,"I really liked these. My husband said they were good, but my 8 yo. son thought they were too spicy. All the more for me! I rolled them into balls and froze them. Now I can just take a couple out whenever I want them. I ended up with 7 1/2 dozen cookies."
461834,456050,2011-10-28,5,Delicious chicken!!!  I made this as written with the exception of using two very large chicken quarters.  I basted the chicken with some of the marinade while they were grilling.  I made the sauce and served it over mashed potatoes for a wonderful dinner.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for 123 Tag Game.
1592049,487568,2012-09-26,0,This quiche sounds Amazing!! Love the Flavors in This:-)
671744,24712,2007-11-30,4,"This was a very delicious soup which serves well during these wintery cold days!

I did find it rather bland, and so added some cumin and more lemon...Yum!"
517443,378330,2009-09-20,5,"What an explosion of taste..!!!
I followed the recipe almost exept for the balsamic vinigar but just because l didnt have any at the moment...instead l used sherry vinigar.  Also added a dash of white peper....ohhh sooo beautifull they looked!! I even ran upstairs to get the camera and my husband said he wanted more for supper also. sorry l have to go now because lm off to the supper market to get more ingredients for another batch! This deserves more then five stars dont let the ingredients scare you off...ps supper easy and very elegante too...keep up the good work!"
508949,129926,2009-04-16,4,"these are getting 3 stars from me and 5 from DH. i used corn tortillas, as we try to avoid white flour in our home... i added chili powder and garlic powder to the chicken and onion mix but found the chicken a bit bland still. also, the sauce is kind of bland. ...i think i would've put even more sour cream in if i would've known how bland it would be. they just tasted like something was missing to me, but i couldn't quite put my finger on it.
DH loved them, however. he likes things a bit simpler than i do."
163112,225521,2007-09-07,4,"Mine came out almost soupy.  Is this right??  BUT it was stunningly delicious & everyone ate & enjoyed.  :)  Made for the 9/07 Aussie swap.  Thanks, cookiedog!"
602448,150402,2008-05-28,5,"Oh so lovely and perfect for a pregnant belly.  I used fresh peaches and some other fruits (strawberries, cherries, kiwi and banana) that I macerated with the sugar overnight because I wanted fruit salad last night. Thanks so much for this.  I now think I'm going to have to put cream cheese on all of my waffles.  

Done for ZWT4"
67835,10613,2004-04-12,5,"I baked your tasty recipe on a rack in my roaster oven to go with Easter dinner. (Oven taken up with a huge ham). Big hit with the kids!  Like you suggested, I covered first half hour and uncovered second half hour,(uncovered just the casserole dish not the roaster) stirring occasionally. I did not use the jalapeno peppers and used only a bit of dried onion (to please the grandchildren.) Thanx, Bergy!"
239758,445214,2011-04-21,5,"Love these tomatoes. I often roast cherry tomatoes with balsamic vinegar, but I've never added sugar. I made half a batch of these and used generous pinches of brown sugar and oregano. Absolutely delicious. Thanks for posting."
241601,104094,2005-09-22,5,This was by far the most delicious recipe I've made in a LONG time.. It was soooo good. :) I had some rice left over so I used it as a side for dinner the next night.  Worked out great!  Thanks a lot.
2613820,54529,2013-01-05,4,"Thank you for this recipe!  It's our first attempt at making waffles since our daughter's allergy test results meant no more wheat or eggs in our shared recipes.  We made the recipe using 1/4 c. additional brown rice flour, the ground flax seed & water substitution and rice milk (no dairy used by us either).  Our Krups 4-slice Belgian waffle maker made 9 light, fluffy waffles.  We'll use the recipe again."
486148,55583,2007-10-09,4,"This was really good, except that I really recommend increasing the chocolate. Instead of 100g, use the entire chocolate bar, or use chocolate chips. Without enough chocolate, it sort of tastes like a breakfast bar, almost like banana bread without the banana.  We ended up cooking them 30-35 minutes, because they were still soggy in the middle. I think they were good enough to make again, though."
26512,81048,2005-08-27,5,"Fabulous! I was quite surprised by this dish as I had never had a ground gyro before. Perfectly seasoned and yes, garlicky. Two thumbs up from the family. Thanks for sharing, will be making these often."
222564,25885,2006-04-25,5,"All 190 viewers can't be ignored and I too tried this banana bread. The flavor was truly banana and bread wonderfully moist, both due to high banana content. Very basic recipe but good, everyone can add their own bits and pieces to this. I made muffins and iced them with Lynnie the K's Greatest Choklate Icing. Yum!"
55380,33921,2006-12-02,4,"This is a great idea and went over well with the kids; even the 1 yr old liked hers and the older ones all had seconds. I increased the tomato sauce by about half after reading the other reviews about it sometimes turning out a bit dry. I also let the water cook out more and then didn't drain the last little bit before I mashed it. The outside got rather dry (will probably put foil over it next time) but the inside was fine. The only other change I made was to fix a batch and a half due to our larger family size. I used a 9"" loaf pan and added 10 min cook time with no problems. I need to play around with the seasonings a bit per family preference but as a lentil-loving family, I can tell this will be on our rotation often. Thanks so much for posting!"
185285,26967,2006-04-03,5,"This was great with a champagne toast! I made the first round with non-fat sour cream, which I do not suggest as it is not thick enough to stand on it's own. After we finished the strawberries, we added a tbl of the remaining amaretto to a glass of champagne and it gave it a great twist!"
148618,134775,2007-12-16,5,"These were the bestest biscuits ;) Since it is only my husband and I , I cut recipe in 1/2 and also added about 1 TBS. butter and they were GREAT!!!!Just got done eating them for breakfast with gravy.YUMMO! Thanks for a great recipe."
33588,78683,2004-07-29,5,"Great flavor,we love this dish.Thanks"
2001123701,29817,2016-08-11,5,It was real quick and easy scones. Very tasty. My both my boys loved it. I added garlic salt and chives as suggested by someone in their review tnx for the tip. Will definitely make it again.
8688,195989,2007-01-27,5,"This recipe is so good!  I used a can of Pure Maple Syrup #1 light we brought back from our last trip to Montreal and it was just perfect!  The flavor of this is terrific and the recipe is so simple. Thank you, Baby Kato, for another wonderful recipe : )"
531256,339547,2010-05-18,4,"I've been looking something to do with my canned hormel chili, and this looked good so I gave it a shot.  I used just slightly less pasta, only 1 and 3/4 cups left in the box, and a little less cheese I think, i didn't measure.  I cooked the macaroni just shy of al dente and mixed it with the chili, butter, and cheese, put it in a small caserole and baked covered for 45 minutes it was very good.  next time i think i'll add some kidney beans, tomatoes, and maybe some corn.  
thanks for posting!"
56353,45149,2002-11-21,5,"Bravo! Now I will not have to sneek off to an expensive tea house for these yummy sammies. I had such a craving, I made them  and packed them up to take for dinner at work. Very refreshing. "
140132,70646,2012-03-11,5,This is fabulous!  I made this and we loved it.  It is so moist and flavorful.  We left our cherries whole and added a few more on top!  Thank you for a delicious dessert that we are sure to repeat!
296809,55412,2008-04-07,4,"This recipe intrigued me because of my Dallas BBQ roots, its unique ingredients & the fact they do not include the usual tomato influence. I used it as a simple sauce for a well-seasoned & pan-grilled hamb steak served w/potato salad. I made it a dy ahead for the flavors to blend & highly recommend this. It is quite tasty, but thin (as you said). Its thinness may also make it work well as a glaze for a roast & roasted chicken or a marinade. Thx for sharing your recipe w/us."
512060,184956,2007-07-06,5,"Just like a restaurant, but better for you!!! We love these!  I use Mexican rotel.  Extra hot is good too."
204628,316710,2009-09-05,3,"I think there is something not quite right with this recipe.  It wasn't till I started making it that I thought to myself that 1 egg is not going to be enough moisture to make a workable dough with the amount of flour etc, that I've got here. I added another egg and a little milk, then discovered that I'd misjudged the milk, so had to add some more flour!  While I was about it I added a little Allspice, as I'm sure that Welsh Cakes I've had before had some spice in them. After all that, they are very nice!  I also used a 3inch cutter as I thought 6.5 inch was a bit big."
209603,127494,2006-04-13,5,this was really good and sort of an interesting twist on hummus. i didnt have parsley so i used basil instead and i added a little white pepper and lemon for some heat. i also put plain yogert in for most of the oil and blended the beans with some of the potatoe water in the food processor. i really liked the addition of potatoes in it and it was delicious with vegetables or crackers or as a sandwich. i may just start adding mashed potatoes to all my hummus now! thanks for a delicious dip.
118930,132439,2006-05-02,5,"You have got to try this recipe with Kraft Fat Free Catalina dressing! That was all I had on hand and boy was it ever delicious. This sauce has the taste and sheen of Chinese restaurant style sweet and sour sauce. The ingredient proportions were perfect even though I halved the recipe. I used my own frikadelle (South African meatball) recipe #135540 and served them on fluffy white rice. Great recipe, thanks so much!    "
144373,432490,2012-05-24,5,Family loved this. Made the Chicken with Mushroom-Wine Topper.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful.  Loved the flavor of the Mushroom and wine sauce.  Made as written. Made for Variety is the Spice of Life event.<br/><br/> Thank You for sharing.
267283,64312,2006-11-13,3,I followed the recipe to the letter and thought the sauce was lacking something.  It was a little too thin and lacked something.  It needs extra flavor.  I may try it again and take some of the suggestions from other comments and add sour cream or reduce the sauce further.
1831229,446901,2011-02-17,4,"I loved this. Quick, simple and flavorful. I added a bit more curry to kick up the flavor a bit. The curry and garlic really build toward the end.<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
230020,107927,2006-01-23,5,Loved the sauce. We will definatley use it again. It is super easy to make too!
724516,364663,2009-04-07,5,"Hi Fiona, I have made a similar tart to this but I think your Grandmothers is better, the one I make just has currants. The nuts and the cherries make a nice wee change. It's very sweet but sometimes you need a hit of sweetness to get you through the day. I liked the lemon juice in the icing sugar I use water this is  much better. Hope to see more of your recipes on zaar. Thank you for a keeper. Made for PAC spring 2009."
342994,39499,2010-08-24,4,This is a nice simple recipe to make for a week night dinner.  I tried it out a couple of evenings ago and have been taking it for lunch the last few days.  It reheats well too.  My kitchen still has a hint of curry to it.
526666,456689,2014-08-23,5,"Delicious chicken dish! Served with recipe#517873, this made a lovely dinner. I didn&#039;t have a light beer, but it was still yummy with the beer I found to use. DH and DS scarfed their dinner down, so I can only say &#039;Thank You&#039; to LifeIsGood, for sharing a dish that my family really enjoyed!"
2000791585,239891,2016-01-01,5,"Excellent! So easy to make, all ingredients are normal and on hand.  I impressed my family, but it was super quick and easy. Love the flavor of using honey digon instead of egg."
2001441713,284688,2017-03-17,5,"This recipe worked great! I added twice the amount of butter and one cup of fresh finely chopped jalape&ntilde;os (about 2 jalape&ntilde;os) and one cup of canned corn (while kernal, sweet works as well). It baked beautifully. ( I also added twice the amount of cheddar cheese!)"
509594,236803,2011-06-20,0,"Very delish! I was very surprised about how the favours worked out.  Enjoy this alot. Definately make again, in fact I will tonight."
2002146409,254176,2018-05-23,5,"Why do you call it an Avocado, Bacon and Tomato Wrap and then say the avocado is optional?"
122235,99248,2005-09-28,4,"This was a nice sandwich.  I mixed the chopped apricots into the cream cheese, which I spread on both pieces of bread.  I only made one layer of sandwich.  I bought a very hearty bread & I wonder if it was a bit too dense to let the filling really shine."
123118,23938,2007-04-05,5,So good!  I put the fish on a wire rack to ensure it drained and didn't re-absorb any extra oil.  This is a keeper!
45524,75202,2008-12-20,5,"The name says it all! We love love love blue cheese and in this dish, even with the full amount it is a subtle, delicious compliment to the broccoli. I realized at the last minute that I didn't have cream cheese so I used light sour cream (less than the amount of cream cheese) I also didn't have Ritz crackers, so used Stoned Wheat Thins. They were nice and crunchy on top. Score another winner for Kittencal, I will definitely make this again!"
96205,25422,2004-04-05,5,"We love this recipe!  I add a little soy sauce to the mix and it's great.  

What I like is how easy this recipe is to make.  They freeze well too so I can make a double or triple batch, freeze them and have a quick and easy dinner for weeks to come.

It's also a great recipe to have kids help you with.  They can easily help you mix the filling and have a blast helping you roll up the grape leaves."
496803,365880,2012-05-29,4,"We absolutely loved this!  I omitted the chickpeas and jicama, and used sugar instead of splenda.  For me, half of the dressing was plenty, but I saved the rest in case it was a little dry the next day and needed more.  The flavors are outstanding; a nice tang from the vinegar and a hint of smokey goodness from the cumin.  This will definitely be made again, both for BBQs and for a lunchbox filler.  Thanks so much for posting!"
24235,27515,2002-06-25,5,"You're right NurseDi, these are incredible. I made them as a main course and served with fresh corn and cole slaw which made for a great summertime supper. I didn't have 4 hours to marinade the chicken, only 1 1/2 hours and they were still melt in your mouth good, soooo tender! The sauce was a perfect compliment to the chicken. The only thing I didn't do was to mince the onion. Mine was more like a coarse chop. Next time I will take the time to mince them as suggested so I get a little bit more of the onion flavor. Thanks for an easy and delicious new ""keeper""!"
35268,16410,2002-10-11,5,"Well....you should have tried them as they are VERY good. The only change I will make next time, and there will definitely be a next time, is to add a few more chopped dates. Probably 1 1/2 cups instead of 1 cup. Thanks for sharing."
29782,245661,2007-09-10,3,I sized this down to 6 servings and used on our steaks. The flavor was nice. I let steaks chill with seasonings for a few hours with adding alittle worcestershire sauce too. Thanks for sharing.
281701,228701,2008-11-08,5,Super recipe!  It was devoured before I had a chance to take a picture.  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!  :)
56003,288002,2008-07-06,5,"This was wonderful!  We love summer because we can get the best veggies from the farmer's mkt.  This will go in the fridge just to have on hand to eat as a side or a quick cool lunch.  Thnx for posting, mliss.  Made for ZWT4."
422893,349024,2009-02-17,5,"These are really tasty burgers and a great way to use up excess zucchini. Rather than top with tzatiki, I topped with honey mustard mayo and salad for a delicious Friday night dinner. Thanks Bluemoon!"
6651,36911,2002-10-01,5,"Very nice.  I made this for a birthday party and turned it into more of an antipasto dish by adding chunks of provolone, salami, and pepperoni.  I also added green olives stuffed with garlic since the birthday gal loves them.  Everyone raved about your the recipe, especially the shrimp and eggs.  Thanks."
186070,57250,2007-06-24,5,"These were really good, I halved the recipe and baked in a 8 x 8 square pan for about 41 min. and they came out beautifully I used milk choc. chips. They look like the picture.  I think next time I will add some pecans or walnuts because that would make them even better.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe."
49773,29246,2005-07-05,5,I made this last 4th of July and forgot to rate it then. Well it was a huge hit then and was another hit this year! Thank you for posting will be our new regular batter from now on.
1191401,5184,2009-03-04,5,"sounds   good , i will make it. but i know its  gonna  be  good"
37449,479460,2014-05-07,0,"I&#039;m not leaving stars because I scaled this way down, just eyeballed the amounts, and substituted some ingredients. Turned out good and I enjoyed it! Thanks! Made for PAC, spring 2014."
239378,113930,2005-08-28,5,"I was looking for a simple steak marinade and came across this one, WOW! This was very easy to mix and what flavor.  I highly recommend this marinade."
2000226477,297900,2015-05-25,0,This recipe is simple and delicious! I used honey dijon mustard since thats what I had on hand and I added some green onions. Came out perfectly!
468351,165587,2012-06-24,5,"I have used this recipe many times, when roasting turkey legs for two people.  It is simple to make and very delicious! Roasted turkey legs are always on rotation at our house."
645143,125021,2010-07-26,5,The was a perfect recipe. I was heavy handed in the rub and used double but what a great flavor! It was exactly what I was hoping for--thank you for sharing!
369715,182528,2009-12-19,4,Good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written other then I didn't have cheese crackers. I kept all the measurements the same. Good but a bit plain. Nice snack.
778089,84907,2009-12-29,3,"i had 1.5 boneless chicken breast and the onion soup mix was still overwhelming. i added mushrooms too as some had suggested..i dont think i willl make again. it was edible but definately not ""wow"""
463435,193176,2012-03-04,5,"Yummmm! A definite keeper of a recipe!  I used boneless skinless thighs in place of the chicken breasts in this recipe because of the cost factor. The yellow rice was a new ingredient for us...and one we will certainly have more often! The only change I will make to the recipe next time is to double the olives which is a request my kids made. We topped the dish with some fresh chopped cilantro, sour cream and a little grated cheddar cheese. Thanks so much for sharing this tasty and simple recipe. Made and reviewed for the 62nd AUS/NZ Recipe Swap."
49561,325574,2012-06-22,5,"I searched far and wide to find something that I could use zukes in, then I came across this.  I'm glad I did because it is a really great jam with all kinds of goodies in it:  zukes, pineapple, ginger, and habanero.  I canned this the other week and just got to taste it tonight with some cream cheese on crackers (like the pic)... amazing and addicting.  It's a bit sweet for me, but the DH loved it.  I didn't have crystalized ginger on hand, so I ended up using a nub of fresh ginger.  We didn't add the red dye to the jam because we stay away from dyes in general.  I canned in the small 4oz jelly jars to give away for Christmas.  I can see al the bits of goodies in the jam, so it looks very pretty.  I think this will be good on some chicken, shrimp, and pork.  Water it down a tad and use it as a spicy glaze when grilling.  DH says it could probably go with goat cheese... hmmm.. sounds like a good idea to me!  Thanks for this recipe!"
2001680367,66409,2017-08-20,5,Very yummy. I used 1\2 powdered sugar. Very piecrusty.
169430,350140,2014-03-06,5,"Another 5 rating from me as well. Great flavor combo going on here. This was the first shrimp I&#039;ve had in a long while and, boy, was it good. Made fro The Best of 2013 Tag."
621626,306820,2009-07-30,4,I made this using shell pasta instead of fettuccine. I did leave out the sliced mushrooms because I don't like their texture. I do think that 8 servings is stretching it a bit. I think 6 would be the most you could get out of this recipe. Made for Photo Tag
166294,23108,2008-02-08,5,This was my first time making granola and I won't be buying it anymore!  My husband is raving about this recipe and so is my 10 year old son.  I am so glad I tried it!  (Tip: I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil and it worked great...we're trying to be more cholesterol friendly.)
1667711,59515,2013-04-05,4,"I used less than half of the almond extract, and loved it. Thanks Veg-Chef for warning about that, and thanks rsarahl for the awesome recipe!"
168462,141278,2006-01-08,4,"This was a good dip. It makes a lot, so if you have a lot of guests this will go a long way. It was ready in the crockpot exactly at the 2 hour mark. Thanks for the recipe."
185726,25897,2006-03-07,5,I used Tilapia instead of Halibut. I washed the fish and patted them dry before marinading and baking them which helped keep the marinade on the fish. Next time I will double the marinade recipe as it almost wasn't enough and add extra lemon (personal preference). We though the recipe as written was fabulous though!  My DH & I ate until we were stuffed and enjoyed every bite! Thanks for posting! 
2001827809,531147,2017-11-27,1,"In my opinion cornstarch isnât necessary for creamy scrambled eggs. I didnât like the gummy doughy texture it gave them. A tablespoon or two of heavy cream and an extra yolk, well seasoned, and then you just simply donât over cook them and they come out very light and creamy."
179471,35568,2005-01-31,5,"I have used this recipe for the last couple of years. My family wanted me to make dessert one year for Thanksgiving, and my mother suggested pumpkin cheesecake. This was the first cheesecake I had ever made. It is very easy and it is now a 'demand' from my family anytime they can find an excuse to celebrate something for this. Now I'm the cheesecake person in my family. I want to increase this recipe to make in a springform pan and I plan to try it with ginger snaps as the crust. I use a 1/4 teaspoon of both nutmeg and cloves. Just by mistake at first, but it seems to be popular with my family. So I continue to make that mistake every time. :) Delighted to find it on here after discovering it! I was going to post it if it wasn't here already. Thanks!"
37449,44659,2003-07-08,5,"I don't usually mix my veggies and fruit together, but I'm glad I did on this one!I used cantalope instead of honeydew, cause I had 3 cantalopes that I had to do something with fast! I froze 2 of them in chunks(for my smoothies) and took a recipe dare and made this lovely salad. I used balsamic vinegar. This was a taste treat! Thanks Dreamgoddess!"
2001270488,100208,2016-11-25,3,The pie was very watery and gooey. I literally had to eat it with a spoon. Maybe next time I'll add more cornmeal or add flour as I've seen in other recipes.
494593,121014,2009-01-19,5,Loved this sauce.  I used this to marinate then brush over my chicken wings as I was baking them.  Excellent!
11461,174022,2009-07-18,5,"DH always likes salt on his watermelon, so I thought he'd like this.  He sure did, but so did I, and I never want salt on my melon!  I halved the recipe so it would only serve 3-4.  Well, I must admit it only served two.  Our watermelon was cut up closer to 1-inch cubes and was very easy to eat.  This is such an easy, amazing salad, I think we'll be making it quite often.  Thank you so much, JoJoStar!"
291980,213903,2007-12-29,3,"I thought this was good. My two teenagers didn't like it at all. A couple of commments about the actual recipe...it would of been better if I didn't have to convert grams to cups as we don't have a scale. Also, there was no temperature listed at which to bake it."
1334304,387261,2009-10-05,4,"This recipe was pretty simple and definitely a good way to add something relatively healthy to your diet. I followed the directions exactly, but instead of using 2 whole eggs, I used 2 egg whites and 1 whole egg. It seemed as though the mixture would be too much for the pie crust, but it cooked down and looked beautiful. I think the oregano was a little overpowering (I've never been a fan of oregano). I think I'll experiment with other spices and see if I like it any better. It's still a good dish though!!"
152393,102818,2005-02-25,5,"Delicious!  I was a little hesitant when I was making the frosting (I thought it might be too sweet) but it was perfect on this yummy, moist cake.  Thanks Mercy for this wonderful cake! "
222717,29354,2007-06-21,4,"I didn't use the coconut flavouring, mostly because I didn't have any at the time. I added 2 tablespoons of cherry brandy instead of the rum which worked really. Was great with fresh strawberries!"
281701,98880,2006-07-07,5,This is really good!  I used the ground cinnamon.  Thanks!!
802987,15087,2008-03-27,5,Absolutely wonderful. I did this for my family for easter and it was a huge hit.
2001671773,343698,2017-08-14,5,"Like everyone else, it turned out great. I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I used 3 large spoon fulls of vanilla yogurt and enough milk to make 1.5 cups, worked perfect. It is messy to serve, for the next time I think I will do cupcakes and then add all the extras to the cake in individual cups. I loved the coffee flavor in the filling, I didn't have espresso powder, so I used some strong coffee instead, worked just fine. Made it for my mother-in law's birthday and scored bigly!"
613250,107786,2012-06-10,5,"These were excellent!  Nice easy way to cook ribs without slaving over the smoker or BBQ and very tasty, falling off the bone tender.  Got rave reviews from all of our guests and will definately make again!"
107135,476656,2012-10-05,5,wow oh wow these were good i love that the barb b que  sauce is mixed with the meat it really flavors them up good stuff
59686,102274,2012-04-21,5,"After making this soup, I wanted to make it a bit heartier, plus I thought the soup didn't have enough whole black beans. With that being said, I also noticed I ran out of canned black beans, so I ended up adding a can of pinto and a can of soy beans, plus I added 2 cups of frozen corn kernels. Since I added the corn and more beans, I found I only needed to simmer the soup for 30 minutes for it to thicken up. I did want to mention... when saute'ing the vegetables in oil, I did use 2-1/2 tablespoons, plus I added a bit more carrots (2/3's cup). I saute'd the vegetables for 9 minutes before adding the garlic, and after adding the garlic, I only saute'd it for 1 more minute. I enjoyed this soup topped with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and sour cream. I do think by adding the hickory flavored liquid smoke, it gave the soup lots of flavor. My husband and I enjoyed this soup, and I will make this again, but with the modifications I made. Little Bee, thanks for sharing the recipe!!"
1798319,330437,2011-09-26,5,Absolutely delicious!  Definitely a keeper recipe.
2203995,47189,2012-03-06,5,Made this tonight to go with Mole Chili.  cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup. Loved it! Will definitely make it again.
56463,88202,2004-05-19,5,"Oh, Miller thank you for answering my request. I just made this recipe and it has the right amount of smokey flavor and the right amount of ""zip"" from the horseradish. My husband is a happy man! This dressing will brighten up any salad. Thanks, Carole in Orlando"
936601,307329,2009-03-11,5,Really easy to make and delicious!  I used Special Dark Chocolate Hershey's Syrup.   For the frosting I used butterscotch and peanut butter chips because I forgot I was out of chocolate chips.  LOL!  Still delicious!  I will be making these often!  Thanks Starry!  Made for Holiday Tag.
52282,63033,2003-06-01,5,"after a long busy day it was late, i was tired and everyone wanted to know what we were having for dinner. i had planned to make this tonight, but much earlier, and by now i didn't want to cook. but- how silly, in 10 minutes i/we had a fabulous dinner. i made white rice in the steamer, then started this  last night i had cleaned the shrimp and made a stock with 3 lbs of shells and tails. so i used 1/4 shrimp stock in place of the chicken broth. i stir fried everything in a hot wok with peanut oil, i also used rice wine vinegar instead of red wine for a more authentic flavor--
this was great, a bit spicy for some, but we loved it! thanks for a great recipe, i will be making this often, but maybe next time i'll only use 8 thai bird chiles, dd counted :)"
383346,282774,2009-03-09,5,"The first sip, I said Yum!  But while drinking it, I felt like it was too sweet.  I made it only for 1 cup and didn't take the time to put it in the fridge.  So next time I will not use brown sugar cause with the molasses it will be sweet enough.  I used a little bit of half and half cream in it.  But didn't use whipped cream on top cause I didn't have any leftover.  Thanks mom2rose :)"
1554576,152136,2010-06-06,5,"So good!!  Love this one.  Just made it and now I'm sitting here eating it ;).  My very first experience with quinoa...wasn't sure from the directions how to ""cook the quiona""  if you boiled it until it was done like pasta, or if you just cooked it until the water was absorbed like rice.  I cooked it until the water was absorbed and it was perfect.  Substituted red onion, red bell pepper, can of Mexi diced tomatoes and added corn. 

LOVE IT!  Thanks MDMAMA."
894427,40983,2008-08-22,5,"I have been baking yeast breads for over 30 years and always searching for the perfect roll recipe.  LOOK NO FURTHER.  These are by far and above the best yeast rolls that I have ever made.  I don't have a bread machine so did the kneading by hand.  To keep these rolls tender do not over-knead the dough.
Thanks for the wonderful recipe."
269480,282011,2008-10-11,5,"This is so simple and a different way to cook corn. I don't know what the ice cubes were for but these came out juicy.  Love it! Thanks, baby/mom! :D Made for PAC Fall 2008."
2934632,351921,2013-08-07,2,"This cake exploded (literally exploded) all over my microwave. I think the recipe calls for too much baking powder or something because this did not work. I dumped what was left of the mixture into a cake pan and baked it for a while and it did taste ok, however I will not be making this again."
254614,355195,2012-02-24,5,This was delicious! I used the brown and wild rice/ Rice a Roni. I think I could use cauliflower<br/>flowerets with it the next time. Thanks for posting!
28177,359067,2009-03-28,5,"Wow!  We have eaten a lot of chilis & we now have two favorites, one for turkey & this one for beef.  Amazing flavor in this combination!  It's got a little heat but that can all be controlled to suit individual tastes without sacrificing the overall enjoyment.  The recipe looks like a lot of ingredients but it was actually very little work.  Most of my time was spent draining cans.  ;)  We loved the wide variety of beans & the addition of corn in this recipe, but the best part had to be the sweet & sassy chipotle aroma that filled the house during the 3 hours I had it simmering on the stove.  After the first bite, DS (15 yrs) claimed that it was his ""all-time favorite"" chili recipe.  I made 1/2 the recipe for 3 of us & a toddler & that gave us plenty for dinner & another dinner and a lunch vacuum packed & frozen for later.  This would be a perfect OAMC recipe.  Next time I'll make a full recipe (using two dutch ovens) and we'll have awesome chili on hand for months!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Sharon!  We'll be making it again & again!  Made & enjoyed for Pick A Chef, Spring 2009."
945507,151446,2013-11-28,5,Yum!  I added corn like another reviewer did and it was delicious.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks!
766542,33671,2008-12-11,5,This was my first whole chicken ever and we loved it. Lots of flavor and really different. Will definitely make this again! Thanks!!!!
507661,116111,2008-02-06,5,"this recipe has been in my family for years, however when my gramma died the recipe went with her THANK YOU so much for posting this, I thought that i would never find it again.  My gramma used to put it in 2 med sized clear bowls so you could see the pretty colors THANK YOU AGAIN for posting this awesome recipe."
2001862932,423754,2018-08-06,5,My grandma who was of German heritage but lived all her life around Danish immigrants in Western Iowa made a breakfast dish similar to this one that the family pronounced âDatchâ. We also made Ableskeiver but this was the go to when we were late for church. Have you heard another name for this recipe?
481092,97340,2007-11-16,5,Used this rub on boneless skinless thighs and they turned out wonderfully.  Thanks for posting a nice zesty seasoning mix!
56919,107235,2005-01-25,5,Super easy and tasty.  The simple addition of freshly ground black pepper adds a nice kick.  Used turkey pepperoni that is 70% less fat and did not find that the cooking time needed to be altered.  Still put them on paper towels after cooking to catch any bits of grease and there was a little but not much.  These crisp up  nicely after they cool down.  
113517,32804,2011-02-13,5,Yum!  I make it and keep it warm in a little crock pot.  Very good.
522099,307423,2008-06-14,0,"I am not a fan of fruit in 'savory' dishes so I figured I wouldn't care for this one, but I really wanted to make it for the Holiday Challenge since it's the national food of Uzbekistan.  This recipe didn't change my mind about raisins in rice, so I'm not going to give it a star rating, just the posted review.  The recipe worked well, but it's jusst not my taste.  made for EE Holiday Challenge ZWT4 for the Daffy Daffodils."
2001189614,50342,2016-10-01,5,"Awesome recipe. Very very good. Sauce isn't too lemony either. Subtle but delicious. My husband is the pickiest eat I know and scarfed it down. His reaction was leaning is head back and saying &quot;amazing&quot; with a thumbs up, lol. Only thing I changed was using chicken tenders instead of breasts and using 8 oz mushrooms, not 12. Perfect amount of mushrooms, honestly. Thanks for the recipe!"
310518,304954,2008-06-09,5,"Fabulous!  We both liked this very much, with my husband saying the fresh parsley (I use Italian Flat-leaf) really was the perfect complement.  The prep time for me was closer to 25 minutes.  I did not use the optional fennel or mint. The ONLY change I made was to reduce salt to 1/2 tsp because I used canned vegetable broth.  The directions are a little confusing, calling for 5 cups of liquid, and then saying add only enough water to keep beans from sticking.  Using only 3 cups of broth, there was more than enough liquid.  The sauce that this makes was perfect over rice!  I will definitely make this again.  Made for ZWT4. Thanks very much for posting, Sassafrasnanc!"
1220686,126892,2012-07-31,4,"This was good- not really what I expected. These are more like a cheesecake swirl in the batter- my filling was pretty runny because I softened the cream cheese, so it just kind of sat on top and swirled into the batter a little. They were tasty, however. I drizzled chocolate over the top to make them look pretty as they were for a birthday. And yes, mine were done at 22 min, too."
690623,75737,2008-06-01,5,Excellent marinade Kittencal.  Used it on two big Prime Rib Steaks and only had 9 hours to marinade.  Worked beautifully.  Thank you
233780,132754,2008-01-05,4,"We really enjoyed this, did add a few shakes of mexican seasoning. i used chicken thighs not chicken breasts as we prefer it.

Easy to prepare, will definitely be using it again. Thanks for posting"
2001382100,26162,2017-02-07,5,I made 2 loafs..one for me and my mother..it turned out fabulous with all ingredients. I'm making this now for a team meeting at work..i added 1/2 cup of brown sugar as well. I will also polk holes with a tooth pick and soak it in real butter.
754127,82023,2008-09-01,5,"This was unbelievable!  I followed the recipe exactly and I have never had better results.  Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge, it is so much appreciated!!!!"
398964,54257,2007-02-23,5,"I love meatloaf, and this is one of the best I have had. What really makes it, though, is the sauce. What a great, simple sauce! It really makes the meatloaf. I think I'm going to start using this sauce with other meat recipes as well, it's so easy and tasty."
66321,15474,2003-11-29,5,"This recipe was wonderful!! I loved every bite! The sweetness of the raisins is a nice contrast to the olives and capers-the combination of flavors were right on the money. I did add extra corn (alot extra) just because..well, I don't know why--I just did..and couldn't have been more pleased. This is a very forgiving recipe, also-I didn't realize that I was out of Worchestershire until it was too late, so I threw in a tablespoon of soy sauce, and it still tasted great, so I guess I didn't mess it up too badly! Thank you, Clifford, for one terrific recipe that I will be making MANY times in the future!!
TERESA"
126440,66575,2010-06-01,5,Great salad which can be used as a dessert too.  Easy to make and loved the sauce.
440324,232055,2013-05-12,5,Oh wow! Thanks to you I just found my new favorite vegetable. Everyone should try this. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe with us.
2001401019,198707,2017-02-21,5,"Delicious. Used whole organic chicken and low sodium chicken broth. No water. Left out thyme. Cooked on high for 5 hours. Added egg noodles, turned off crookpot and let sit for about 30 minutes before eating. I did cut salt in half. Next time I will probably only add 1/4. We are fighting the flu in our house and I swear, I woke feeling better than I did yesterday. Will definitely use this recipe from now on."
430471,215139,2007-04-23,5,"This was wonderful. First time I ever made anything like this and boy was it good.  DH had three helpings.  Okay I used precooked rice, I had leftover and added it with the meat and heated it through. I reduced the water by about 1/4 cup and I only cooked it 1 hour 10 mins. Which was about 10 mins too long. Very easy and yummy."
1098982,157080,2009-01-16,5,"This recipe is to die for I made this and there was not one crumb left. One slight change I made that made it way better than Olive Garden's version - dredge the filets in the alfredo sauce, covering each filet thoroughly. Then dredge in the crusting mix, throughly covering top and bottom. This adds so much more flavor plus locks in all the moisture - no dry spots, no sticking. So moist and tender, but with the crusty outer coating. This goes in my ""make often"" cookbook!"
268058,250445,2008-06-15,5,This is all I make also-  great pancakes!
2008451,210330,2018-03-07,5,"Yum! This is a perfect recipe and I'll be using it again and again - hubby loved it, too! Your biscuit recipe is as good as mine, and I didn't need buttermilk which I didn't have anyway. I mix my dough in a food processor: dry ingredients, pulse, add butter, pulse till crumby, add milk, pulse just till dough forms a ball, pat out on a floured surface 5 times to 1/2&quot;, folding into quarters after each pat down, last pat to 1&quot;, cut (I often do wedges for crispy tips), lay on baking sheet, bake. This makes layers in the biscuits almost like those canned ones. THANKS!"
267283,106627,2006-02-07,5,"I was really nervous about cooking this because my boyfriend does not like for things to be too sweet, but this dish did not disappoint!  It was perfect.  I will be making this again.  Thanks so much!"
1333601,77096,2009-07-24,5,"This stuff really works, the introduction is true! Whenever I have a cold or am about to get one, I make Subru Uncle's rasam and it's like instant relief. Forget Vicks and pills, just have good ol' traditional rasam. Its strong fresh spices and flavors will help you from the first inhale! Thank you, Uncle Subru!"
12343910,9054,2017-05-08,5,"Oh my gosh! These are *so* much like the ones I remember from my childhood it's incredible! Mom used to make these occasionally (mash potatoes weren't a common leftover at our house ??). Only difference I can tell is that she used Kentucky Colonel seasoned flour. These were absolutely delicious plain, better with real butter, and made me giddy with real butter, sour cream, and a little shredded cheddar. Thank you so much for sharing!"
44807,4414,2004-03-25,4,"This was an interesting change of pace in a potato dish.  It is a bit bland.  I also added more seasonings (garlic, pepper, paprika, seasoning salt) My husband like it.  I wonder if frozen hash browns could be substituted.  Having to grate the potatoes might keep me from making this dish again."
133174,117175,2005-06-20,5,Updating my previous review.  I finally found the rapini in the store.  It was young and tender and cooked in 10 to 15 minutes.  Followed the recipe except for reducing the cooking time and I had a shallot that was calling out to be used.  The rapini cooks up to a dark green color.  
358513,374206,2009-09-02,5,I had fun making these simple yet delicious cookies. I did sub some rose water for the vinegar just cause it's a holiday.I added raisins for my son. Such an easy dough I just made everything in the food processor. I will definitely make these again. Maybe with some coconut next time. Thanks. Made for Ramadan Tag 09.
52543,56103,2003-10-27,5,"An easy recipe with excellent taste! Since I'm not a big salt user, I was surprised to find that I too added more salt. The only recommendation that I would make to other chefs is to cut any larger sprouts in half or they will be too crunchy. Thanx Sharon! "
168831,199636,2010-02-23,5,using organic/free range chicken makes this really good!
1372870,29598,2010-06-15,5,This was the easiest marinade to make and all of the family loved it - not one complaint!!!  Definitely AMAZING!!!  Try it - you will not be disappointed!!!
1072593,301349,2009-06-24,5,You've HamWow-ed me! Get it...ShamWow?!? :-P Made for Everyday is a Holiday.
1226388,268331,2012-08-04,5,"These were easy and delicious!!  I made them to go with some pikelets, but I saved some to put over ice cream.  Just the right balance of sweet and tart."
1169062,178374,2009-12-14,5,"Delicious!
I used  twice the amount of (vegetable) broth and the whole can of light coconut milk.

Added 1 package of firm tofu, cubed and about a cup and a half of cooked pumpkin pieces."
55729,19527,2002-12-14,5,"We all loved these! I am all for anything with avocados, and anything with salsa. Now I have an excuse to eat them all day long! I made these for Mirjam's tribute weekend. We love you, Mirj!"
750529,73166,2008-02-02,5,"Amazing recipe!  I cut the sugar in half, only used one chili pepper, and added a tablespoon of chili powder.  I also used 1 lb of cubed beef sirloin in addition to the 1 lb of ground beef.  I used Bass ale as my beer (20 oz. can).  I am not a huge fan of most chilis, but this was really, really great.  I'll be making this often!"
530501,165276,2008-09-18,5,"I made these exactly as stated in the recipe. I usually change something, but I didn't this time. They were perfect. Maybe my family is getting used to whole wheat but they tasted light to us. We like them a little crispy, so I always stand them up while cooling. This is my new waffle recipe. Thanks. Good job!"
383346,132467,2009-04-12,5,I tried it with 10 ounces strawberries and 10 ounces of blueberries.  I used fat-free plain yogurt.  I didn't use the almond extract.  It's great.  Thanks PaulaG.  Made for Gimme5 tag game
226863,458529,2011-08-17,5,"This is such a quick and simple recipe!  I made it in right at 10 minutes...and that's a plus in my book!  I love balsamic and garlic, and they were very nice with this.  I didn't have tenders, but cut a breast up very thin and made it that way.  Thanks for sharing!"
223979,149752,2006-05-03,5,"We love these!!  Very easy to make.  They do need to stay in the fridge because they do melt, but they are delicious!  My kids can't get enough!  Thanks!"
329769,503158,2013-08-24,5,Reviewed for ZWT9- This made the perfect brunch recipe today and was enjoyed by my family :) Made as written using &#039;&#039;banana&#039; chillies for the peppers
133174,265648,2008-02-12,5,These are habit forming.  I did have a little problem with the proper measurement. It could have been that my pound measure of pecans was a little shy.  There seemed to be way to much syrup/vinegar and I ended up draining the excess off and toss with additional pecans.  They were also baked at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.  I did use a Grade B maple syrup.  These make an excellent treat or a very nice gift.
50551,119550,2006-02-18,4,"I used flavored coffee creamer instead of whole milk and opted for 1/4 flour and 1/2 oatmeal.
They were very good!
"
1803251858,262423,2014-10-21,5,It totally rocked snack time for a group of 9 yo girls at a Girl Scout meeting. They couldn&#039;t wait to eat it! We skipped the olives and optic nerves and substituted gummy eyeballs and gummy vampire teeth.
2002007246,508776,2018-02-22,5,The consistency of the sauce when added to the egg plant was not how I expected it to be (it was a tad watery) but nonetheless was so delicious and tasted exactly like the ones at PF Chang's!
189616,62386,2005-04-18,5,"Very colorful and my DS's thought it was very good!
Thank you Kree"
398275,133448,2007-10-01,4,"Love it!  My ""guilty pleasure"" is Top Ramen and this is a yummy, creamy and buttery way to enjoy it.  Thanks ms_bold!"
1020526,267796,2010-01-24,5,Ooh la la!  Who knew how delicious a homemade mocha could be?  I did use half and half for the milk and topped with real whipped cream.  Delicious!  Made for Comfort Cafe Snow Queen Chalet/Swiss Miss.
211184,215869,2008-03-01,5,"A delicious wholegrain bread recipe! Very easy to make. I switched to US measurements and weighed my flour. I did end up adding about an extra tablespoon of water to have a moister dough.  I don't have any traditional ""loaf"" pans so I made 2 free form baguette style loaves and adjusted the baking time to about 25 minutes. Thank you for sharing. This recipe will be in my bread baking rotation. Nick's Mom"
544026,376,2007-12-08,4,"Just made these and they remind me of potato latkes or pancakes.  They were quite tasty, but I really try to avoid frying, and that is the only criticism I have.  I wonder if spraying a broiler pan with Pam and putting them in the oven would work?  Maybe I'll try that the next time I want to make these when I have an extra supply of squash.  A friend dropped off a box (maybe 100 small squash)and I chose a bunch of Zaar yellow squash recipes that appealed to me.  The only problem is that I still have half a box left!  I already made three different recipes which I plan to rate, but there is a limit to how much one can eat......In putting the recipe together, I used a Vita Mix machine to mash the squash and mix all the ingredients.  I just chopped the onion roughly, and the machine did the rest.  It makes one life a lot easier.  Thank you riffraff for the tasty and savory recipe."
126146,199579,2009-07-19,5,"My little ones (ages 3 & 20 mos.) love this! They both asked for seconds, and my son rarely does that. Sometimes he doesn't even want to eat dinner. Thank you!"
324621,158087,2006-09-25,2,"We didn't like these. They were dry and tasted like diet food to me. I was really hoping they'd be good because the recipe and all the great reviews looked so good, but we simply didn't care for them."
487511,47111,2008-10-01,5,"This is really a great tasting and especially fantastic smelling, bread! I do agree that the texture is more that of a bagel, but I just love bagels!! I added 2 more tsp. of cinnamon, close to 2 cups of raisins and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. It came out very soft and absolutely delicious! I was concerned about how ""wet"" it looked in the beginning so I added some flour (about 2 tbsp) as it was going through the first cycle and in the end it was perfect. I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful the house smelled as it was baking! We were trying to have a ""discussion"" (hahaha) with our teenage daughter, but had to wait because we were all distracted by the smell :) The little ones kept interrupting asking when the bread would be ready! Thanx!!!"
320518,112685,2006-09-03,4,"gives mild fish a nice ""restaurant"" flavor.  Fast and easy.  "
1803428495,11345,2017-02-03,5,"Just made these since I was totally out of milk and butter. Increased the sugar and vanilla extract a bit. Since the recipe suggests crunchy at 400 and I wanted soft, I just dropped the temp to 350, and baked for 8-9 min. It didn't stick to the cookie sheet on the first try, but I added parchment paper on the following anyways just to make clean up easier. Not the best cookies I've ever had, but it absolutely serves its purpose. I like the fact that it's not overly sweet and my 3yo loved it. Super quick, mess free, foolproof."
416119,149223,2007-01-01,4,"I have used this recipe for years! It is a quick, hearty casserole and not just for breakfast. I use it as a base. I add leftover chicken, pork or beef and add a salad. Easy recipe to expand on!"
489552,233179,2009-06-04,5,"This was excellent.  A great evening snack.  My girls were eating them as they were coming out of deep fryer, so I didn't get to take a photo :( The sauce was great, I used spicy horseradish which gave it that tang!  Excellent FT.  Thank you for posting.  Made by member of ""Cooks With Dirty Faces"" for ZWT5"
1579905,131628,2011-10-31,5,This worked well for us!  Thank you!
449929,68514,2007-05-07,5,MMMMMM...this is so delicious!  I will be making this a lot this summer.  Thanks.
1673097,19177,2010-08-29,5,"With a little bit of tweaking, this recipe was delicious!  I added fish sauce, red bell peppers, and a few leaves of fresh basil, and did not put in the toasted coconut at the end, since my husband doesn't like shredded coconut. For hot sauce I used Lee Kum Kee's Guilin Chili Sauce (which is really more like a paste). I used 1 tsp in the recipe, but we ended up adding about another teaspoon to each serving at the table cause we like it hot. Oh, and I used red potatoes, and didn't peel them since I don't mind the skins."
140132,118373,2013-04-19,5,"I made this for my family and they loved it.  We served mashed potatoes, corn and biscuits with this.  What a comforting meal.  I really like how the loaves held up nice an firm.  The gravy that goes with this is rich and flavorful.  This is a keeper, thanks for sharing with us.  I love trying your recipes."
985729,220316,2010-04-06,5,"These take a little while to put together but they are really worth it!  I put them in my parents Easter Baskets, and they were thrilled!  Of course I had to keep some for myself too!  I decorated the tops with Easter sprinkles and they looked so pretty, and tasted wonderful!"
37779,61911,2003-08-02,5,"Chia, this was so simple and easy. I used a roasting pan instead of a baking sheet. It was easier for me to toss the vegetables to get them coated. Thyme is one of my favorite herbs and goes well with zucchini. The flavor just comes to life. Thanks for sharing your recipe. It is so easy, I won't even need to look at a written recipe. "
108892,24612,2005-07-01,4,"This cake is so rich and moist.  My sister LOVED it and said it was the best thing she's ever tasted.  I, on the other hand, thought it had a slightly artificial taste to it despite using natural extracts when available and real butter.  The texture is velvety smooth and crumb is delicate.  Maybe if I use fewer flavorings, I can get a more natural taste.  Thanks for posting and I'll be sure to try it again w/ just vanilla, almond and lemon."
1139231,7553,2010-06-07,5,My husband said this is the best rhubarb strawberry pie he has ever eathen!
296809,252937,2010-07-06,4,"Tagged for the *Zaar Stars* game, I made a single serving of this tasty new version of my morning oatmeal. Sweetness is always a matter of pers pref & I agree w/Sarah Jayne that in this recipe it is entirely a matter of the OJ used. I expected mine to be tart & it was, so I used a bit of honey to correct that for me. I esp liked the use of nutmeg & even sprinkled extra atop the oatmeal. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us."
347034,68876,2007-12-14,5,"This was the best deviled eggs I ever ate. We added a little more garlic salt,cilantro and green onions for taste. Great recipe."
1023761,21151,2009-07-26,5,Fantastic!  Even better then Chili's!  I used cilanro instead of parsley and lime instead of lemon.  I also skipped the onion as my husband is not a fan.  I was able to replicate my favorite fajitas from Chili's :-)
431961,468752,2012-09-24,5,"I made this yesterday, 9/23/12 and did some tweaking of my own, because of what I had on hand and our taste.<br/>I had 3lbs chuck stew meat already cut up from the meat market so I doubled the recipe.  (Trust me when I say, do NOT double the amount of beans especially if you soak them over night.:)  There's another black bean recipe review going up after this one!)  <br/>I used onion powder, no red onion; I used 2 15oz cans no salt added tomato sauce; 2 lg Tbls minced garlic in olive oil; 7oz can diced green chilies; 4 Tbls chili powder; 3 Tbls  cumin (we love it); 2 tsp dried Mexican oregano.  It's completely different than standard dried oregano.  I added a very healthy amount of fresh ground black pepper and 2-3 good shakes of the cayenne bottle.  We enjoy heat.  I didn't salt it because we really try to cut way back, hence the heaping on of other spices, but I goofed and not paying attention, I bought the regular version of beef broth vs lower or no sodium. I used about 3 cups of the broth and 4 cups water, since I was doubling the recipe.  I browned the meat in about 2 Tbls olive oil on about 2-3 sides of each cube with a bit of sea salt and cracked black pepper.  Tossed it and the rest of the ingredients into a 6qt crock pot and set it on high for approx 6 hours,only because I forgot about it.  It then cooked for about another 3 hours on low and my oh my!  I'm so glad I cooked it that long on high, because it made the meat ultra tender, the beans were perfectly cooked without being mushy and the flavor is robust!  Even without creaming or blending some of the beans for a thicker broth, the 'gravy' of this chili is nice and thickened without being dry.  I added a bit of chicken broth when I heated up a bowl of leftovers, thinking it looked thick and it didn't need it.  Once heated it was just as if not better tasting than yesterday.  My husband and I had it last night for dinner over some steamed brown rice, and today, I skillet fried some whole kernel corn, drained from a can, (no salt added) in 1 Tbls of butter and browned it nicely and added a few tablespoons of corn to a bowl of the beans.  This chili was awesome alone, with the rice or the corn.  I know I tweaked it alot, but your recipe was the perfect base for what I wanted to eat.  Thank you so much for posting."
280166,102942,2007-01-06,5,"This SHOULD be named 10 lbs ice cream dessert, caused that's the minimum amount you will gain eating this.  It is decadent but super easy to make-great dish to WOW them!"
2001328811,48907,2016-12-30,5,we are making it tonight for our holiday open house! we plan to use the egg wash....AND made it with raspberry/pepper jelly for a more savory treat!
41799,19934,2002-07-01,3,"The use of so much fresh lemon juice and the lemon butter sauce really over-powers the whole dish.  Pernod can add such a wonderful flavor to a mussel preparation and with the lemon juice, you couldn't even taste the Pernod.  It had a great amount of garlic, which we love, and all other ingredients were very good.  I doubled the recipe because we love mussels, but I really don't think that had any bearing on the end results.  I will prepare this again, but definately cut the lemon at least in half in all preparation of the recipe. I will let you know how it turns out!!  Amazingly, I found this recipe also listed as a Copy Cat recipe (on another recipe web site) for a mussel's appetizer served at Carraba's (which my husband and I absolutely LOVE)and it isn't even anywhere close or in the ball park of that oustanding preparation that they do.  If anyone has that recipe, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE post!!!!"
209152,165843,2012-11-14,5,"This is so simple and so delicious and the cabbage (I used regular green cabbage) added just enough bulk to make it a chunky, delicious sauce.    I will definitely make it again.  There was enough to feed an army so it would be good for potlucks!!  Thanks for sharing"
163171,52213,2004-09-15,4,I was really surprised that your could make jelly out of mountain dew.  The kids loved it and it is not something I have ever heard of.  Good recipe!!
223112,25534,2005-08-02,4,"This was great. The top was very crunchy and tasty, but the bottom was kind of soggy, and stuck to the pan. I will try this again with a different pan. It still tasted wonderful."
307532,27652,2009-05-03,5,This marinade is delicious! My only addition was a dash of cayenne for some heat. I probably left the chicken marinade for about 2 hours in the fridge and it was incredibly tender. We will definitely be having this again!
424680,361733,2011-07-01,5,"I pretty much followed Hokies' lead & made just half a recipe since there were only 2 of us, but considering how tasty this really is, I have plans to make it in another 10 days when we'll have dinner guests who will, I know, love it as much as we do! Obviously a keeper of a recipe! Thanks for sharing it! [Made & reviewed in Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup tag]"
2558365,190597,2012-12-23,0,"Love this recipe.  I agree that 8 minutes is a little too long to bake them.  I used the mini shells and went with 4 mins, and they were just right.  I also added just a little spot of butter on top before I baked them,  Nummers!!"
356986,84764,2008-09-26,5,"We entertained my husband's coworkers this summer, since they don't have a company picnic or anything. I made this as one of the side dishes, and I wish I had made double or triple! It went like lightning. I think people took it as a main dish instead, because my husband didn't have to do too much grilling! Always a pleasure making one of your recipes. Keep on posting, and I'll keep on cooking! Thanks so much!"
9869,11040,2001-10-19,5,"Bergy, this is absolutely delicious..Asparagus is one of my favourite vegetables..and I make a quick stove top using balsamic vinegar. But made like this and with the parmesan as well....it was superb. =)"

I made it as printed ~ except a tad more on the garlic~ but that's just me! The chicken melted in my mouth & everything else cooked to my liking~ Great Taste and it will be on my menu agian! THANKS FOR THE DARE!!~POKER~"
474474,93048,2010-01-28,5,Delicious. I used what was left of a roasted duck and increased the ginger and sage a bit while leaving out the broth (using water instead). I also used wild rice in place of the brown rice.  It was divine.
303545,214534,2007-08-02,5,"So incredibly moist!  I ended up having rather large cuts of meat, so I doubled the dry mix, and kept with the regular amount of honey and vinegar.  It worked out well as everything was well-coated.  i think that this would taste fantastic with something light such as a side salad to play off of the spicy/sweet flavor.  Thanks kburie!"

125388,126496,2007-08-25,5,"Really good for a quick informal supper with chips and a green salad.  I held these together with toothpicks to make sure they wouldn't come unwrapped.  Also, I baked them on a foil lined pan for extra easy cleanup."
1800139492,280067,2013-10-20,5,Amazing! I make this all the time!
88099,265012,2007-11-25,4,Very nice soup and so easy to put together.  I made this as directed except made half and it still made a large amount.  I also added some dried red pepper flakes to spice it up a little more.  Served this with a little cheese on top and cornbread.  Thanks
53932,131014,2007-11-18,4,Great tasting soup with minimal effort!  I did add additional bouillon for extra flavor.
2002026769,320302,2018-07-09,5,"Love it! What to do with the basil was left out but I think it goes in when the parsley goes in, so that's what I did."
326039,1005,2008-01-07,5,"I only made the sauce, and it was very good and oh so easy to make!  I think next time that I will simmer the sauce for about 5 mins to evaporate the alcohol from the wine and allow the sugar and salt to melt.

The crust that I used is:  http://www.recipezaar.com/80617  I wanted to try it because of it's ease.  It uses baking powder rather than yeast, so there is no kneading and rise time."
86988,398442,2013-09-12,5,"This cake is outstanding!  I made it for a church potluck last weekend.  Someone made a similar version, without the candy bars and glaze.  Mine was a huge hit!  I used five snack size Almond Joy bars, halved, and five snack size Mounds bars, halved.  Rather than stir the candy into the cake batter, I evenly spaced the halved bars on top of the cake batter in the pan and gently pressed the bars into the batter, barely covering each piece with cake batter.  The glaze is a must have; do not leave it off!  It is like the fudge icing on a chocolate doughnut.  Thanks, Jane, for a fabulous new recipe.  :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P.S.  My cake took 55 minutes to be perfectly done.  After the recommended time, I kept checking at five minute intervals till the cake was slightly pulling away from the sides of the pan and till I got a tiny bit of &quot;bounce back&quot; to a finger touch in the cake&#039;s center."
353579,262124,2008-05-21,5,This made a great lunch!  I used reduced fat and non fat versions of the dairy products and bacon bits and it was great - full of flavor.  Thanks for posting!
695933,94710,2013-05-29,5,"I did this for Memorial Day May 27, 2013 take some time to recognize and remember our fallen heroes, and the brave men and women who keep our country safe every day. What a great idea - can&#039;t believe I haven&#039;t tried this before! crispy on the outside and so tasty.  I used seasoned salt for the seasoning. My family really liked these fries. And say Thanks for posting this recipe, I made this for 2013 Zaar Cookbook Tag."
168921,135404,2005-11-04,4,"This is a good, basic cake. I tried a piece sprinkled with sugar, as suggested, a piece with chocolate frosting, and a piece with cream cheese frosting. It was much better with the sugar and the cream cheese frostings than with the chocolate. I should try it with fresh strawberriesâ¦"
2549711,139357,2017-02-20,5,"Great recipe! This is the first coffee cake I've ever made, and it turned out perfect. I loved the marbled look of the cake and how moist it is. I did not make any alterations when making this cake. I did double the recipe and baked it in a 9x13&quot; metal cake pan. I think if I had made a regular batch (not doubled) the bake time would have been perfect, but I did add just a couple extra minutes."
69690,19662,2003-02-02,5,"Wonderful recipe! Made this for Sunday dinner with oven roasted potatoes and a tossed salad..mmmmm!

It's lovely and soothing.  Made exactly as written, wouldn't change a thing. I sweetened with honey.  I really enjoy honey in these kinds of teas, it brings out all the different flaovrs of the spices subtley.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  Made for the Fearless Red Dragons - ZWT8 - India"
320870,16887,2008-02-03,5,These are the BEST onion rings ever!!  Added Frank's Red Hot Sauce to batter & they were delish.  Used one large sweet onion & it made plenty for the two of us.  May try Beer instead of milk and see how it turns out.  Thanks MizzNezz for a wonderful recipe.

645094,13680,2008-02-17,5,"This is an excellent soup!  I am eating it right now and it is heaven.  Based on what I had on hand, I didn't add the condensed soup, and instead used a 14.5 oz can of stewed tomatoes, 8 oz can of tom. sauce, and a 14 oz can of tom. paste.  I also blended the soup after simmering it for 10 minutes, because I'm not a fan of large chunks in soup.  I also cut the cream cheese down to 4 oz.  Very easy to make!  Only took about 25 minutes from start to eating!  Thanks Nicole!"
18344,89204,2008-12-02,5,OUTSTANDING!!! we used frozen white corn and i added a can of green chilis. this recipe is insanely good! served with brown rice. enjoy! :-)

83093,226588,2007-05-23,5,"Hands down the best cobbler I've ever made! I followed the recipe with 1 exception - running short of milk, I topped off the 3/4 cup with 1/4 cup cinnamon vanilla flavored liquid coffee creamer. I also used the optional cinnamon sprinkled on top.  It was darned easy to put together and the smell as it baked was so mouth watering I had trouble concentrating on my dinner. ;-) Thanks for sharing this stellar recipe!"
330937,130004,2009-02-15,5,"Very good.  Our kitchen has smelled like cardamom for days now.  The ice cream packs down much after mixing this all together, so you don't need a container any bigger than the original ice cream container."

1320105,117317,2010-03-13,5,"These cookies are fabulous!  I did use the 2 3/4 c. flour and they were thick and chewy and did not spread much at all.  I used a cookie scoop for mine.  I do not like flat crisp cookies, so these were perfect for me.  The kids loved these and they couldn't get enough.  Same with their friends.  I did not care much for the taste of the dough and as my husband loves to eat cookie dough, he didn't like it much either, but he absolutely loved the baked cookie!  These will be made often.  Thanks for another fabulous chocolate chip cookie."
383346,498723,2013-04-30,5,This is a great recipe.  I made half of it.  And ate it all.  Because DH doesn&#039;t like balsamic vinegar on strawberries.  Too bad for him.  Thanks Mikekey :)  Made for Rookie tag game

529278,251220,2009-11-09,5,"I actually ate eggs.  I don't eat eggs - haven't in years.  Just a few bites, and I can't eat them anymore.  I think it's a texture thing.  But these were good.  I actually ate quite a bit!  My husband said they were certainly fluffier than normal, but not really anything special.  But since I can actually eat these, we'll do them more often.  Thanks, Kittencal, for helping me eat eggs!"
440324,450198,2012-04-24,5,"The best Toum recipe I've tried so far ( I've had a couple of failures). I used zester to mince the garlic very fine. The yogurt is what made it stand out, but what I liked about it the most was that afterwards my arms weren't falling off from grinding and whisking, like with other recipes. I was still able to prepare the rest of the dinner :-)  Thank you."
337963,69225,2007-09-17,4,"We loved these, hubby especially!  I added more milk to get to the right consistency and omitted the salt altogether.  Delicious!  Thanks for a keeper Junebug!"
1427769,308716,2009-11-05,5,"I made these last night.  My hubby is a VERY picky eater (more so than our daughter) and he loved these.  This will be the only Lasagna that I make from now on.  Thanks for the recipe, so quick and easy.  I always have cooked hamburger in my freezer so this was a big plus recipe for me only one pan to clean."

1228237,25219,2011-02-25,5,"We loved this dish.  After cooking it on the stove top, I baked it in the oven @400 for 10 min and it turned out great.  I wasn't sure what ""cook under a grill"" meant.  I assumed it meant to broil it, but I wasn't sure.  :)"
211682,20616,2009-03-17,5,"Such  a nice bread, crusty on the outside, tender on the inside,very much like a scone. I didn't have raisins and substitued them for dried cranberries that I soaked in hot water for about half an hour to plum them up. I also only added half the caraway seed."
1859491,184241,2011-03-20,0,I made this for a crowd so I used 2 cake mixes in a larger cake pan but did not double the wet ingredients.  Did not want the cake to be too messy.  Also toasted the coconut flakes and sprinkled them on top of the whipped cream.  They loved it!

163112,479862,2012-05-31,5,Yum!  And easy to make.  I used regular almonds because i couldn't find blanched almonds.  I added some to gently warmed extra virgin olive oil to dip bread into.  everyone liked it.  Now to find other ways to use it!  Made for Welcome to Egypt in the NA/ME Forum 5/12.
459341,17961,2007-03-05,5,I agree with kuntryqtpi...it does taste a lot like a dish from Johnny Carino's.  I ate it the other night and came online looking for a similar recipe and found this.  Just made it for supper and will be using this recipe again in the future.  Delicious!
218535,284271,2012-04-24,5,Very tasty. I'd recommend doubling the sauce mixture and seasoning in noodles.
452355,369895,2009-05-22,5,This was a really nice appetizer!  We halved the recipe with great results.  I especially loved the taste of the manchego cheese with the roasted red pepper.  We used cremini mushrooms in this dish.  I will definitely make this appetizer again.  Made for ZWT5.  Thanks!
367364,29679,2010-09-22,5,"I made a half batch in an 8 X 8 baking dish, and cut down on the sugar, as another reviewer had mentioned. (I used 1 cup.) Totally delicious. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!"
136997,207084,2008-09-30,5,"Very tasty! I used a Napa cabbage, as I like it over the regular type. As with another reviewer, I will crisp the bacon up a bit next time and I think some garlic would be nice in this. :)"
1180533,93308,2009-03-03,5,My step-sister and I made this as one of our first OAMC recipes. We used only half the recommended worcestershire sauce and it turned out really well. Thanks Kzim4

653438,144799,2011-03-19,5,"I fixed this following the instructions except for adding some minced garlic with the onions, peppers and hamburger mixture.  It was close to what I make when wanting comfort food.  Very tasty.  Made for Spring PAC 2011."
2545772,261606,2012-12-06,5,"This casserole was so easy and delicous!  I lived in Louisiana for 13 yrs and know my cajun food.  If you follow the recipe exactly, the casserole is kind of dry like a jambalaya is.  I wanted it more moist and creamier, so I added an extra can of soup, I chose cream of celery, some chicken broth and kicked up the seasoning a bit because it needed it in my opinion, with some Tony Chachere's seasoning."
107276,136428,2009-11-27,5,"This as awesome lasagna!  I first made this about 2 1/2 years ago and have passed it on to family because they thought it was great too.  I did make a few changes.  First I'm famous for not really  measuring when I make something like this but I usually do well just eye-balling.  I used boneless chicken breasts that I sauteed with the mushrooms, used a store bought ""fresh"" roasted red pepper & tomato sauce instead of the crushed tomatoes and just added fresh basil and more cheese like the recipe mentions .  I am sure the recipe would be great either way.  Great change from regular lasagna that freezes really well!  yum yum!!"

I just read the review where the member said they followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT left out the baking powder, then complained about the results, and said she'd never make it again? Oh come on, does anyone else find this foolish? Sheesh!! I have now made this recipe 4 times following the recipe EXACTLY as written and my family and I love it, and I will continue to make it.."
465056,322927,2011-07-10,5,"The flavor was awesome. I used a sausage with alot of sage seasoning it it.  My husband loved it. The apples I think would have been better shredded instead of cut into bits.  My daughter thought it was ""too juicy"" The balls were a tad greasy but that probably was the sausage.  Maybe half sausage and half lean ground beef would have taken care of it."
482933,494382,2013-09-11,5,"What a great recipe to showcase cauliflower! Lemon, garlic, parsley, and Parmesan compliment it.   Made as posted except I put all the parsley in with the water. The sauce is not thick but there to spoon onto plate."

665299,153956,2010-09-14,5,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Bev! All my adult life I've been trying to make ""Chicken Fried"" anything, with less than satisfactory results. Why? Because the coating would fall or peel off during cooking, either just slipping off, or sticking to the pan and being pulled off. I have followed your recipe twice, now, with excellent results. The only changes I made were to season the flour with some onion powder and smoked paprika as well as the salt and pepper. I think the secret is letting the pounded, egged, and flour-coated meat sit on the racks for the 15 minutes before placing in the hot oil. (the last time I made it, it sat a little over 30 minutes.) The coating did not stick or want to slip off. It stayed married to the meat, thickened slightly, and became golden brown with a nice crunch to the bite upon eating. My family loved this recipe; my husband raving for days about it each time. It IS very fattening, so we won't have it too often, but what a treat to have occasionally. Thank you, again, for posting this recipe.."

2534189,343395,2014-08-21,5,Easy and very tasty!  Used Italian seasoning instead of thyme since I was out and I didn&#039;t measure but I probably used closer to 1/2 cup of cheese
228536,50590,2005-07-13,5,Wow!  This was absolutely delicious!  I added sliced potatoes and used a crock pot after browning the meat and bringing everything to a boil.  I will definetely be making this pot roast again for my family.  thanks again  :)
215829,377556,2013-05-15,4,Very Very Good.  I sprayed the chicken with butter flavored spray before baking.  Yum!!
501778,371807,2009-09-27,4,These were pretty good.  For us it needs a little more flavor but that is easily fixed! Thanks!

203854,66035,2005-08-15,5,"I have a theme party every year in March.  This year it was Middle Eastern Cuisine.  I made this and it was the first to go.  I can't remember how many chix breasts I made, but it served 100 people.  I have since made this a staple in my house."
126435,154636,2008-06-26,5,"I was looking for a good sweet bread recipe for my Mom who is a diabetic, and decided to give this one a try. I used ground oats instead of whole wheat flour, and I only used 1 mashed banana. Then I added shredded zucchini to make up for the other 2 bananas. I added a dash of  nutmeg and ground cloves, and about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. My Mom LOVED the zucchini/banana muffins! The sugar and carb count was reduced even more by using zucchini. Thank you so much for a treat my Mom could enjoy!"
2001916830,150384,2018-01-07,1,Nothing like Panera. Followed the recipe exactly...
723491,276,2011-02-24,5,Excellent appy!  Enjoyed by all at a recent party.  These quickly went into my favorites to be made again!
2220702,5478,2012-03-25,3,We served it with rice and I would agree; next time thinking about adding some sweet onion to it;)
236470,278082,2008-10-21,5,I  agree  with  the  others  and give  this  5 stars. These  are  quick and easy  to  make  and  taste  great.  Thanks.
828499,96843,2009-01-20,5,"Thank you! Thank you! This is one of my all-time favorite recipes. I recently moved overseas and misplaced my mom's pot pie recipe. B/C of the time difference I didn't want to call and get it......but here it was! My family gobbled it up so fast, I made another later in the week."
60650,121923,2010-12-31,4,"This seasoning mix was pretty good. Followed instructions with measurements exactly. I for some reason could not find the chives in the spice rack,pantry and cupboard. Major suggestion is to cut back on the salt to 1- 11/2 teaspoons. Two teaspoons is way to much and turned out very salty! Unless you like thinks to salty do not change a thing."
1340973,204589,2009-12-05,5,"I make these cookies every christmas.  They are soooo delicious.  I always seem to get close to 4 dozen from this recipe.  I know they're prettier with the drizzle, but I usually skip it and they're still fantastic."
45763,107786,2013-08-03,5,"Yes, Beth...these are melt in your mouth good!  I only marinated with the rub overnight and placed in the oven of 225 on the way to church.  Came back...and dinner was to die for!  My new &quot;go to&quot; recipe for ribs.  I think I&#039;ll try chicken too."
2050598,46967,2011-11-01,0,"I made this for a banquet potluck - very delish - I added a little chili powder to zip it up a little bit, next time I might get medium salsa instead of mild. Yummmmmy"
24565,28851,2002-07-07,5,This is a great recipe!  It did take longer than the stated time both times I made it.  But it was worth the wait!!
705251,250519,2008-01-04,4,I love this recipe!  My daughter found it on Stove Top's site and made it for me!  Wonders will never cease as she is a new cook.  The only change we made due to lack of sour cream and her recipe did not mention mayo - so we used 1/3 cup low-fat milk.  It seemed to work well too.  Thanks for sharing.
133174,223245,2009-10-15,5,This was made and enjoyed using shredded Nappa cabbage and the rice wine vinegar.  The seasoning packets for the noodles are very high in sodium so I did opt to leave that off and added salt and pepper to taste.  This recipe is very versatile and one that I will try again using the broccoli slaw mix.
677763,93447,2007-12-06,5,"i have a close friend who made this when i was a kid,,,loved it then,,,love it now....so easy to make

sarah from kentucky"
463202,171167,2007-10-04,5,"This was exactly as promised, VERY simple (a stuffing recipe I wouldn't mind doing because it went so quickly!), very fancy looking, and VERY yummy!  Everyone, including my picky picky 5yo loved this recipe.  I have the feeling a lot of the flavor of this recipe depends entirely on the type of pesto and mustard you use.  I used a very mild dijon and a store bought pesto, and it turned into a lovely creamy mild sauce that everyone loved.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  I made up 4 extras to see how it freezes for a fancy OAMC chicken recipe. :)"
346497,116926,2010-06-21,1,"Boo! These were A LOT of work (compared to normal corn on the cob) and truly disappointing. Followed the instructions, but did not taste the bacon at all. Precooked the bacon slightly and it was still way to undercooked to eat."
804550,135223,2009-07-24,5,What a clever idea! These were fantastic! Thanks for posting! Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup Soup tag.
146284,50639,2006-02-28,5,This is wonderful on beer can chicken as well.
250440,122586,2007-08-30,5,"This was really great.  I doubled the recipe and everyone LOVED it!  I used wheat tortillas to add a bit of whole grains to the dish.  I diced up the fruit the night  before and squeezed some lemon into it (to keep the apples from  browning) then mixed the juice, jelly and brown sugar right before serving.  It was a bit juicy but still had some good chunk to it.  I'm wondering how a bit of red onion and/or cilantro would taste in this mix.  Maybe parsley if you don't like cilantro.  However, this one's easy to adjust to taste.  This will surely be one I make for my next gathering.  Thanks!"
369715,137730,2010-07-15,3,This was OK for us. I followed the recipe as written. My youngest liked it but hubby didn't. I thought it was OK. I served it as a side dish.
498271,386706,2013-01-08,4,"Great easy, tasty and inexpensive soup!  I used more than a dash of cayenne for a little extra heat.  Yummy and low-cal as is, I think it would be great with some chicken or turkey sausage added as well.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
268426,50979,2007-12-27,3,"This was OK. I brined my chicken and pounded it (as suggested) and it came out so tender. I used Florio sweet marsala wine. Carabba's has that ""to die for"" taste, and I thought this was missing that. This recipe is plenty good but I think it's still missing something to be a true copycat."
1127368,350631,2009-09-22,5,"Have made this several times now, its very easy and super tasty. The second time i made them i cut into squares and dipped in dark chocolate. So yummy!"
23937,5177,2001-11-20,5,"What do YOU do with the extra 1/2 loaf of dough?

I have a large bunt pan, so I increased the ingredients by just a bit and used a full 2 loaves of frozen dough.  If you don't have the larger pan, you can always put the extra in a smaller pan and bake separately."
560305,191886,2008-12-28,5,wow - fabulous.  No need for stove top popper.  I used my non-stick wok and it was perfect.  Just shook it over the flame.  Also added a shake of cayenne pepper when adding salt and sugar for a little kick.  Wonderful
209255,207339,2007-09-21,5,"This was great.  I made it exactly as stated and it turned out perfectly for me.  Even my kids enjoyed it!  We are thinking of putting some vanilla icing on top just for fun.  It certainly doesn't *need* it, we just think it would go well!  :)  The spices are ever so subtle and the cocoa doesn't over power either.  It still tastes like banana cake which works well for us.  Thank you for sharing a great recipe."
112720,53914,2008-06-08,5,"Made this for DH & I. He doesn't like talapia, but I get a taste for fish every once in awhile and talapia is inexpensive.  I cooked this in foil packets on the grill using non stick foil.  Put layers:  butter - 2 small filets - topping & cooked 1/2 hour.  Even though the topping wasn't crisp, tasted great.  We liked the tang the mayo gave the fish.  I will also try this in the oven next winter."
395981,246309,2009-02-05,5,"I was a little skeptical of the oatmeal but this was really good.  The only thing I did different was to add 1/4 cup ketchup & a 1/3 cup chili sauce mixed together and spread over the top of the meatloaf and I used all turkey because that was all I had.  My DH's only complaint was that he didn't really care for the carrot (there was nothing wrong with having carrot in it!) I think it was more that he could see the carrot than really taste it, but besides that I will definetly make again!!"
1592784,159509,2011-11-13,5,AAAMAZING!  These bars smell delish!  I doubled the recipe and had to add an extra 1/4c butter.  I also used homemade pear jam.  I don't think these babies will make it through the day!
361931,307996,2008-09-24,5,"These were really good.  Used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and left our the celery.  Used Zucchini and Onion and Green pepper (along with the mushrooms of course), and a few grape tomatoes that I had left over.  Made for PAC Fall 2008"
779699,383683,2010-03-15,5,Super easy and elegant! We loved these and so did our guests. We used Carr's crackers. The creamy-ness of the goat cheese goes perfectly with the tangy/sweet flavor of the glaze. We made half with the arugala and half with spinach which also tasted heavenly! Thanks so much posting! [Made for PRMR tag march 2010]
1267223,37393,2009-06-19,5,So delicious and easy to make!!
222564,31567,2014-01-11,5,"Great! I halved the butter amount as some other reviewers have, as well."
135634,149856,2006-08-22,5,"Easy to prepare, very tasty. Made it exactly as written - even the New York strip & A1. I prefer this with the Filet Mignon, butterflyed, and positively do NOT care for the A1. Next time I'll use Worcestershire. Also, I will add sliced mushrooms to the shallot saute. Still excellent, nonetheless."
579154,8220,2009-02-19,5,Delicious!!!! I used sugar free pudding/jello and fat free cool whip.   I only had  shallow pie crusts and this recipe made a lot of filling so I made 2!   I just froze the 2nd for later.  I'll make this one again.  Thanks for a light yet scrumptious recipe!I
745062,91624,2010-05-13,5,"Living very far off the beaten path, I had to adapt this to what I had available.  I made it with 1 - 15 oz. can of Cream of Coconut, 2 cups whipping cream (actually Rich's,) NO added sugar, because the Cream of Coconut was already very sweet, 1 Tbsp Baccardi Rum, and a few drops each of coconut flavor and rum flavor.  It was still too sweet, so I added about 1/2 cup of Coffee Rich (you could use milk,) and it's delicious!"
610488,240769,2008-01-18,4,Didn't think the lettuce should be in the recipe but it turned out really to be very good!
305869,66306,2006-05-01,5,"We loved them.  I actually halved the recipe,  added 1/4 soup can of water and stuck them, covered, in the oven (I ran out of time for the crock) at 350 for 1 hour.  It's like eating a creamy baked potato with all the fixin's.  I'm thinking they are probably even better out of the crock-pot.  Thanks!"
246367,101041,2009-05-14,5,"This is the BEST chocolate chip cookie recipe EVER. I didn't have the 1/2 cup of butter, so I used 1/2 cup of canola oil and it still came out perfect. I also used dark brown sugar since thats all I had. I used kosher salt instead of regular. This cookie reminds me of pepperidge farm brand. Next time I'll try adding some coconut. Thanks for this recipe!"
67270,211118,2007-05-29,3,"We liked this recipe, but I don't think we'll be making this again. Of we do, we'll be making some big alterations. I thought coconut milk would be an improvement, and something besides peppers, since the peppers tend to override the rest of the dish."
2001484337,164457,2017-04-12,4,"I only cooked for (1) which I don't find wasteful, and it doesn't take to much time or energy to cook whether it is feeding (1) or (6) I remember as a young girl my father used to make these on occasion, I have tried in the past to recreate but no matter what I did I cannot get the exact taste that I was so delighted to taste when he would give me my first bite after he took them out of the oven. I learned from my father to add or delete what appeals to my taste buds and seldom did he, or I measure anything. Iin other words food always taste amazing, but very seldom does a recipe taste the same, (always excellent ) never the same This recipe was very good, it does continue to cook after it is taken out of the oven so next time I will not cook over 13 minutes."
1366254,376633,2009-10-01,4,It's mazing how something so simple can be so good
223135,181318,2008-05-05,5,"VERY good recipe! I actually doubled it and did one pan using the noodles and one pan using eggplant: slice the eggplant lengthwise about 1/4 inch thick, brush with olive oil and broil 2-3 minutes on each side, then add filling and roll up like you did with the lasagna noodles. I liked that version even better! I also ""slimmed"" the recipe down using fat free ricotta (I actually used a mixture of half ricotta/half cottage cheese), low fat mozzarella and Eggbeaters. It still tasted rich and my family just raved about it! Definitely a keeper!"
351811,317119,2008-11-03,5,"Wowser this was scrumptious! Definitely made me feel better ;) I used Frozen Mixed Berries. Blueberries, Strawberries, raspberries and Blackberries. YUM! Thanks for sharing such a simple berry delicious therapy cocktail. Me liked it Alot! (Made for Bevy Tag 08) Cheers my friend! ~V"
679953,1437,2008-06-22,5,"very good. It rained today, and the kids wanted to make cookies,they loved them. So did I.  I did not make any changes. Any kid would love these.  Thanks."
983512,107072,2008-10-13,5,Awesome dish with great flavor!!
416985,152413,2010-04-11,5,This was a great little sidedish that comes together so easily!! The whole family enjoyed this! Thanks so much-
198520,125399,2009-02-17,4,I like how these were crispy on the outside.  The kids liked dipping them in syrup.
736192,38303,2010-01-26,3,Not a bad starter receipe. I shredded the chicken instead of leaving in thick strips. I also added a prepackaged sauce. (I was trying for something similar to a resturant I like.) I think next time I'm going to add things like bamboo and bean sprout.
455433,94532,2007-02-24,5,"This recipe is devine!!! I made them this morning and we have eaten a few already! I ended up using half plain white flour and half wholemeal flour. They are moist, light and fluffy. I put in rasperries and blueberries and made 6 big ones and about 12 or so mini ones. I have pics and will post them in my profile. So delicious and a huge hit in our place and with hubby!!! :-) I used frozen fruit and turned out perfect!"
392435,66634,2007-03-22,5,"These made fantastic turkey burgers, with a medium kick.  Even my red-meat loving boyfriend was thrilled by these.  Thank you so much for a tasty, healthy meal!"
59780,99450,2006-07-17,4,"This salad was great but for me the dressing needed to be sweeter, so I added much more honey than the recipe called for. I do tend to like things sweet though so most people would probably prefer to make it as posted. The clolours of the salad made it very visually appealing. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it must have been a lovely part of your wedding meal."
61660,209715,2007-06-22,5,"Very nice cocktail!  Loved the mixture of the cranberry and tequila, surprisingly goes very well together!"
76535,436744,2010-09-13,4,This went over very well at my house. I used ground turkey instead of chuck. I'll probably use more garlic next time. Thanks!
628779,234615,2008-07-01,5,Made this for sunday brunch this weekend and everyone loved them. Made as directed but I did add another tblsp. lemon juice. You cant get much easier than this recipe! Thank you
205772,91851,2005-07-08,5,"Absolutely delicious! I'm making this one for all our family get togethers now, along with a delicious pumpkin ice cream pie and maybe the occaisional pecan!"
224033,50732,2008-10-04,5,"OMG! What a wonderful recipe! Thank you!  Although I am sure that this recipe is awesome as posted what it does is give you very good basics to adjust to your family's likes and dislikes and it still works.  Also, being slow cooked adjustments can be made along the way for anything you aren't sure of.  Think it might be too sweet for you? Then add the minimal sugar and taste it an hour later and adjust till it works.  I knew for my family to leave out the jalepenos and stewed tomatoes.  In it's place I added 2 -10 oz cans of ROTEL tomatoes with green chilis and that worked for us.  Also as a shopping note...2 - 12 oz bottles of the SPICY V-8 was exactly 3 cups.  Thank you again for posting this!"
1300607,73754,2010-01-08,4,I love this recipe. it was the first no-bake granola bars I tried and I loved them! I used Honey and coconut instead of corn syrup and raisins. I freeze my choco chips before I used them so they don't melt and I have also tried this with sunflower seed butter instead of PB. We can't sent PB to school so the Sunflower Seed butter is a nice alternative. But I do find the sunflower seed butter is much much sweeter than PB. I might cut back the sugar next time so these are not too sweet.
837368,42272,2009-11-03,5,"By far one of the best jerky recipes I have found.  The only change I make is instead of using Frank's Red Hot, I use Firehouse Jamaican Jerk sauce. (And we have a dehydrator instead of the oven.)  So good! Making another batch at the moment! Thanks for sharing!"
252727,141386,2008-10-11,2,"I have marinated the meat overnight and yet the flavors didn't come through. I did not have the Accent seasoning, however. I added a teaspoon of the italian seasoning, but clearly the substitution was not successful."
373976,150344,2006-10-31,5,I have made these several times from my baking illustrated and they are great. I have found you can make 3 dozen by using a tablespoon but only cook them for about 12-14 minutes instead.
145290,25478,2007-02-13,5,Very tasty chicken recipe!! This was delicious-I look forward to making it again! Thanks!
1099179,111829,2008-12-27,5,This is a GREAT salad dressing!!!  It is better than the one at our favorite Japanese restaurant.  We love it!!!
168462,24888,2004-11-29,5,Excellent recipe and easy to put together. I omitted the thyme and used cream of mushroom soup. Thanks for the recipe.
59728,123675,2006-08-12,5,"Awsome recipe!!!   Everyone loved it.  I had to change a few things cause I didn't have them though and it was still incredible.  I doubled the recipe and used a 20oz can of crushed pineapple and instead of white sugar I used 4 cups of brown sugar.  I omitted the pineapple huice as I didn't have any on hand but I figured that the extra crushed pineapple and juice along with the moisture content of the brown sugar would make up for it.  It turned out fine!  I also baked it in a pan a slight bit larger than a 9x13 with high sides.  Thanks so much for a great recipe, will definatly be using many times over! :-)"
1583922,164425,2010-03-27,5,"This was just fabulous! My whole family loved it, including my dad, who is veery picky. I added a bit of white wine and it enhanced the flavors beautifully. A 10-star recipe, easy and extra-juicy!"
262966,39087,2008-04-01,5,"Almost 400 review already, but I just had to add my review, because this is definitely a keeper recipe.  I used Kittencal's cajun seasoning recipe (186029) and the outcome was really good!  The only thing that I changed was using 2 TBSP of canned petite diced tomatoes rather than the sun-dried, simply b/c I didn't have any onhand.  When your husband who claims he doesn't like alfredo sauce likes it, and your 2 year old likes it, you are definitely onto something here!!  Thanks a lot."
67525,21600,2003-01-10,3,"The loaf turned out with a beautiful, cripsy crust and soft inside.  I chose to use the dough cycle of my bread machine to make this loaf.  I was disappointed that the bread didn't have much flavor."
27395,21497,2002-05-27,5,"I really, really enjoyed this dish. It reminds me of chicken ala king (which I LOVE!!), except with tuna. The only thing I changed was that I added a 4 oz. can of sliced mushrooms. Yummy, yummy!! No leftovers here!! Thank you!!
~Manda"
166642,359156,2009-07-08,5,These are simple and delicious! I love the hint of honey. I will use this one again.
101919,38569,2005-09-11,5,"This was very unique and delicious.  I have been wanting to try a creamsicle cake for so long that I insisted on finally making it - for my own birthday party! :-)  It was fabulous, and really did taste like a creamsicle!  The directions were very easy to follow and I found it easy to make.  I did not find an orange cake mix at the particular store that I shopped at for the ingrediants, so I did use the lemon cake mix, and the orange Koolaide.  Having tasted orange cake before (made from an orange cake mix), I think that I would like it even better with the orange cake mix, as the lemon cake was a tad bit too tangy for my taste (but its great in a pinch).  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe - it was a light, refreshing, dreamy treat that I will defintely be making again!"
58505,30505,2002-10-23,5,This was absolutely wonderful and extremely easy to prepare.  I received countless praises on how delicious it was!!!  :)
434032,98867,2009-06-13,5,"Excellent made it last night.
Don't start this at 7pm. Whew its a long process but worth it.
I messed up one roll by not rolling it tight enough, the cinnamon sugar mixture distribution swirl is imperative,because it gives the bread its sweetness. I almost wish it was a touch sweeter.... Next time more sugar swirl! Also if you have a standup Kitchen Aid mixer, it will save you time, adding 8 cups of flour by hand was a bit messy. Good luck, we already ate one loave,the others are going as gifts.
PS I have now made this THREE times and my neighbors rave its the best they have ever had!"
33747,28626,2002-07-15,0,"Rellano means filled or stuffed, this is not filling or stuffing its a casserole I was looking for a recipe to fill chiles."
383346,93670,2007-09-13,5,This is delicious.  I did exactly the same and everybody liked it.  Thanks :)
222564,134824,2009-09-19,5,Excellent!
67383,21584,2003-01-09,5,Long time to prepare....better then Italian Prochetta..it was really delicious. Family ate it up quickly!
115048,148513,2006-03-18,5,This was delicious!! I highly recommend and I did not change a thing.
231507,7949,2008-01-25,4,"Quick, satisfying dish! It was so easy and definately hit the spot. 
Thanks Carla."
482933,266613,2011-08-16,5,Definitely delicious! Made as posted-I had bone-in chicken and the timing is right on.   Really appreciate recipes that use ingredients that I have on hand like this one.  Thank you for sharing.
280271,379616,2010-02-15,4,What a simple and refreshing salad. I cut the recipe in half and got 3 servings. I used the napa cabbage (it's like a lettuce/cabbage combo). This is so light and has just a touch of tang to it. Very good and would complement any Asian dish. I served it with recipe #384597 and recipe #378332 and leftover rice pilaf. Yum! Thanks for posting. :)
1183663,91795,2011-05-17,0,"This turned out excellent and was actually very easy! I've always head that this type of dish is extremely difficult to do, but I did it and I feel like a rockstar lol! The only thing I did differently was I used a store bought pie crust that I rolled out fairly thin because my store doesn't carry the puff pastry. My husband loved it, he thought it was the best piece of pork he's ever had!"
1181460,63244,2009-02-23,5,These are amazing.  I've been making them twice a week for the past month.  I eat them every morning!  Thanks for the recipe.
110328,177581,2007-01-12,5,"This was really, really good!  I was looking through the newly posted pictures and this was there, and I just had to try it!  It's good!  I have used strawberry jell-o the most, as that is my favorite, and one time we even used chocolate pudding with the strawberry jello.  It didn't look too appetizing, but tasted good (the dark reddish-brwon didn't look great).  Sometimes I spoon out the fat-free cool whip into small cups, then refreeze it, and then after the jello has cooled, pour it into the cool whip lined cups.  Thanks for a yummy treat!"
262035,32441,2014-09-01,1,I really wanted to like this but it was NOT to my taste at all! Very bland despite having some flavorful ingredients. Was not a fan.
94355,10125,2008-11-04,2,"These were just okay.  I made them exactly as directed, and while they were wonderful fresh out of the oven, by the time they cooled, they were dry and crumbly.  I was really excited about these, but I think they were just too cakey."
264017,332377,2009-01-19,5,"Excellent all the way around! Like Lainey, I served this with chili and it was moist, not gritty and soaked up honey (for DH) and syrup (for me) just like a good cornbread should. I used canola oil and Smart Balance Light margarine, along with skim milk. Thanks Marg!"
1548909,405987,2010-02-12,5,"This so is SO yummy! I made quite a few changes.

I omitted a few things (mostly just because I didn't have them);

the extra can of chicken stock,
 water chestnuts
coconut meat
thai chillis
red curry paste
(the only mushrooms I used were regular white ones, fresh)

Also, I added,
1 TB chilli paste
1 C chopped bok choy
baby carrots
1 t garlic salt

I don't like too many inedible bits, so after steeping the lemongrass, galangal and lime leaves in the broth I strained it before adding the next ingredients.

I added a pinch extra sugar and lime juice because I like it sweet and tangy

It turned out awesome, my husband commented ""just as good, if not better that the restaurant one"""
601528,63171,2008-02-23,4,This a great change from my usual pork loin.  I don't have a grill *gasp* but I did prepare this in the oven and it turned out great.
1147451,98446,2011-07-31,0,"This pie is DELICIOUS!  I made it in a gluten-free crust and, after reading other reviews, left out the ginger.  I also accidentally left out the lemon juice, but it was so good I will leave it out next time, too.   The gluten-free crust browned in about 30 minutes, so if you use gluten-free watch it carefully."
993604,343833,2010-02-03,5,"Very good!  The sauce has great flavor and really makes this wrap.  Instead of browning the chicken in oil, I just cooked the chicken in a skillet with a little water.  Made for PRMR."
2002084712,242922,2018-07-29,0,I think chocolate covered cherries would be way better than peanut butter cups!!
292249,54257,2007-03-13,5,Excellent recipe! I didn't have apple cider vinegar and didn't have time to run and get some so I used red wine vinegar. It tasted wonderful! I did saute the onions as one cook suggested.
199848,67838,2013-09-16,5,"Basic, yet delicious.  You can&#039;t go wrong with a classic like this.   I like that this recipe uses onions, and not just cabbage.  I used sweet onions and they added a nice sweetness.  I served with a dallop of low-fat sour cream.   Thanx for posting!"
100149,16100,2007-02-07,2,"I thought this dish was OK, it wasn't really a winner with my family.  I think we were expecting a different flavor."
56463,22565,2005-11-12,5,"What a great meal all by itself, or with sausage and pickled beets. I used light sour cream, wholewheat noodles and Louis Rich turkey bacon and it was so flavorful.
My husband raved about it and it was even better the next day. Thanks, Carole in Orlando"
39835,397860,2009-11-20,4,"Very good and easy -- my kind of dinner. Popped in a video while we had this great no work meal. I only used 1 pound of sausage (sweet) so skipped 1 onion, 1 bell pepper, 1 bay leaf and only used 2 garlic cloves. Thanks for sharing!"
336177,91096,2007-01-07,5,Hubby and I made this together. First cheesecake we've ever made and as I'm still a 'learner' cook I found it a bit of a challenge but the end result was so worth it! Very yummy. Photos coming soon.
538011,250519,2009-10-06,5,"This was great... but I think I would double the amount of stuffing.  I also added sauteed onions and celery to the stuffing.  I added low fat cheddar cheese to the chicken mixture along with some frozen corn.  When I got up from the table, I turned around and my husband and son were FIGHTING over who was going to scrape and eat the bits from the bottom of the pan."
1770745,28148,2011-02-10,5,"Very Good! The hubby loved it and so did I. It's just the 2 of us, it made plenty for dinner and enough for left overs for lunch!  The only thing I changed is that I didn't have any green onions so I sub. 1 small onion finely chopped and it tasted just fine. Also the crunch is just wonderful on these. Will be making this again!"
793769,19514,2008-03-18,0,"For 1 cup of the granular (pourable, measures like sugar)splenda the equivalent is 24 packets."
265954,59357,2007-08-01,5,"Just delicious and a great pick me up in the morning.  I did't have strawberries, so I added a whole banana, and I also added 2 ice cubes.  This is a keeper!"
969289,340730,2011-12-07,0,"Thank you,thank you, thank you. I had a huge harvest of tomatoes and while looking for recipes I found yours. It is wonderful and I will pass on to my daughter and daughter-in-law. I made two double batches using fresh tomatoes and fresh basil from the garden. I will freeze and add meat later for my husband. May even give as Christmas gifts with some bread, pasta and bottle of wine in a basket. This will be used over and over again.<br/><br/>I have now been using this recipe for a few years and paniced when I could not find this year due to remodeling. I finally found and plan to make in my new kitchen. I love the smell that permeates every corner of the house. Thank you for sharing your family recipe which shall live on in our family too."
540867,11217,2009-08-16,5,"This recipe is awesome! After I had it all mixed and was pouring it into jars, I got to thinking that I should have added cilantro. Will have to do this on the next batch. I doubled the recipe right away and am glad I did. I would highly recommend trying this recipe. You will not be disappointed!    UPDATE:  We have made this recipe for a second time around.  I have made changes and the 3 key changes were we did not use the red peppers, since we used red pepper flakes, and added cilantro, and use 5-6 tomatoes for a double batch.  It was awesome!  Everyone is raving about it and asking for the recipe.  The second time around is our favorite.  I now have 6 more batches ready to go for when our tomatoes are ready.  Looking forward to making it again!!!"
169430,249052,2010-09-13,0,This has to become a classic drink! I used diet coke. this is  smoothness with a kick! This will be great winter or summer. I did pretty much double of Coke but this drink isn't going to be ruined by using as much mix as you desire in it. Thanks Lazy for a lovely drink that I'll keep repeating for both the winter holidays and sipping on the deck in the summer sun
383346,219738,2007-07-29,5,mmmmmmmmmmmm simple and delicious.  I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup Splenda.  Applesauce instead of butter (always in muffins).  They cooked 25 minutes.  Thanks SusieQ :)
311260,78106,2007-03-13,5,"I have not made these, but I had the pleasure of eating them at Countrylady's Tapas Party.  They are soo good, perfectly tender, with complex flavours.  A party in your mouth!! Awesome!!!"
448911,60518,2008-01-12,5,"Beautiful Chocolate Biscotti!!  yum! this was delicious and I will make it again and again! A perfect simple and delightful recipe.

I did have to bake it for 30 minutes though instead of the 15 in the recipe.

A new farourite... thanks!"
27783,26991,2002-09-20,5,"A winner!  This was incredibly easy & quick, and it tasted great.  I loved the combination of the artichokes and garlic in the sauce.  I goofed and used a bigger size can of artichoke hearts, which I thought was fine, as I love artichokes.  I also went heavy on the garlic.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much flavor was in the sauce with so few ingredients and such a short cooking time.  Great recipe, thanks!"
495981,15413,2007-06-13,5,I love this easy recipe.The cookies turn out great the kids love them. With 4 kids you need more easy recipes like this one thanks.
1136781,26110,2017-12-20,5,"These are the best biscuits I have ever had, so easy to make! I followed the directions exactly and using the food processor made it much more easier to cut the butter into the flour! This is now my go to recipe for biscuits. I got 10 nice sized biscuits with almost no scraps. Thank you so much for sharing!"
53932,92058,2006-06-23,4,"I didn't use beer, but just boiled some water with lemon to steam my fish.  The garlic butter was especially tasty with the fish.  Thanks for sharing."
95810,116597,2007-01-19,5,These are excellent brownies.  My family is very picky about their brownies and they inhaled these. They are fudgy and delicious! If making this mix use an extra large bowl.  This is a lot of dry ingredients and is too hard to mix properly if you don't have a big enough bowl.  Thanks for sharing!
305531,126507,2006-07-15,5,"This is wonderful!  My husband thinks that this is the best gravy ever! It's simple, smells great while cooking, and tastes great.  Can't ask for more than that."
28346,25385,2005-01-13,4,"A very tasty veggie dish, and it's rare for me to say that about veggies!  I used low fat cream of 'shroom soup.  Didn't have any crackers on hand to crush up, so I browned old fashiond oats in the butter and used that as a topping.  The combination was great with the added benefit of more fiber.  I know Mom will enjoy some leftovers."
60031,32522,2016-08-28,5,"Hubby is low to no sodium diet, so I made it using salt-free ketchup and tomato sauce, cut the worchesrshire sauce in half, added a splash of liquid smoke, lots of garlic with the onions and some hot sauce. Cooked it all in my Turbo Cooker and after mixing in the sauces, let it slow cook for a hour to blend the flavors (the salt-free sauce makes this necessary since it has little flavor on its own.). Soooo good, will make again."
1072593,198253,2010-12-27,5,"Christmas is over, back on a diet and this was perfect fare.  I noticed when I exercise that I never look good.  I always have the look of pain."
461834,354141,2009-03-30,5,"This was a great lunch for me today!!  I used a boneless pork cutlet but then had to sub some ingredients.  I used dry breadcrumbs and did look for the fresh sage leaves but the ones at the market were going bad, so subbed rubbed sage, then made as written otherwise.  I loved the combined flavors of the parmesan, breadcrumbs and sage with the pork.  Made for PRMR."
1290858,199468,2009-09-25,4,I had this for the first time while in the hospital after my second child was born in 1962.  I immediately knew it was a winner for the little ones.  I fed it to her and  all the others who came after.  Now we are introducing it to the little greats who are coming along.  They all love it now even after all Thanks for the memories...  Gramalane
390859,11558,2009-11-02,5,"Really good and easy to put together.   Used 10 thin (1/3"" thick) chops and left all other proportions the same.   It came out perfect.   Thanks!"
45756,78945,2007-05-11,5,"My mom used to make these all the time when I was growing up, and they were a family favorite.  They are delicious without the chocolate as well."
1623430,433754,2012-10-24,3,Tried for house party this summer. Had a 'woody' flavor as I had some basil stems in there. One person asked for recipe. I added more strawberries for sweetness. Went over fairly well.
57222,417036,2011-10-06,4,"This was really good and hearty - the unusual spice combination works so well and the soy sauce really takes care of the need for salt (I really like my salt you see, so I worried for a moment there!). The other half of the beans goes in at the very end with the yogurt; I checked with the posting chef as it's missing from the instructions. Very important: 7-8 average Finnish potatoes weigh around 700-800 grams (25-28 oz.), NOT 1400 grams as the nutritional info states. You also won't be able to fit that amount of potatoes into this dish no matter how hard you try, so rather than counting your potatoes, weigh them for this one. :-) Now, if I could only decide whether I should eat this with a spoon or a fork... Great stew, thanks SQRT(3)!"
69833,197211,2009-01-07,5,"These were very good! In my gas oven,they only took about 12 minutes or so to bake. I got kind of worried because they didn't rise up too well before I put them in the oven. When they were baking, they rose up all puffy! Thank goodness!
Thanks for the recipe! :)"
232673,108105,2007-06-22,5,Thankyou for a nice easy meal...I added red pepper and carrots and left out the fish sauce. I think this would taste great with the snap peas and I will definitely make it again! Thanks for a great new recipe.
288218,229531,2007-09-03,5,Excellent chicken! Peanut butter and curry were a great mix and so easy to make. I halfed the recipe and served it with a plain jasmin rice pilaf. Its going to be a regular in my place! Thanks so much for sharing!
428885,403900,2010-03-15,5,"This is one great clam chowda! So nice, and so warming, that you will want to eat your bowl and the other bowls too. Followed this exactly, except used low-fat half/half, which I had on hand, and needed to use up. I also used some fresh clams which I put into the soup 2 minutes before serving, they opened up, and looked pretty sitting atop the soup bowl. I especially love the bacon - this gives it a rustic feel and the seasoning blend is another plus from this recipe. I have enough to use for many other great recipes! Made for *Special Meals* Photo Forum March 2010"
219942,236734,2008-06-02,5,"Wonderfully crisp tender asparagus!  I used Johnny's Dock seasoning and my stovetop grill pan. This was enjoyed by everyone in the family, and we ate the leftovers cold with our fingers! Grilling or roasting asparagus is the only way we do it, the flavor is fabulous! Made during ZWT4."
726344,278395,2008-01-14,5,"These are very good have made them many times,we call them Apple Dews."
226069,252894,2009-08-06,0,wow this was so a wonderful meal. i had trouble finding garam masala and eventually found it at whole foods market. i doubled the recipe and should have gone easier with the chili powder but the family still loved it. I had some plain greek yogurt on the side to cut some of the heat. thanks again I will make this again.
40135,35224,2009-11-25,4,"UPDATE:  Cabbage as still crunchy, but flavour was great.  Next time I will soften the cabbage prior to assembly.

Can't wait to eat this meal. I just prepared it for the freezer, as I am filling before baby arrives. I added Soy Sauce and HP, as another poster suggested. Meat mixture tasted delicious. I also doubled the cabbage called for. I already sprinkled some grated sharp cheddar on top.I'll come back and review once we eat this meal!"
582972,103216,2007-09-09,5,"My neighbor gives us zucchini so I found this recipe on the computer.  Everyone who has eaten my zucchini bread raves it is the best they ever had, including the man who grows the zucchini. You did not mention squeezing the juice out with cheesecloth but I do this.  Everyone is always asking for more, it is an easy recipe and very very delicious!!"
416985,82934,2010-01-21,5,"I made this a few weeks ago (with my X-mas leftovers) and it was great! I do remember it being a lil' spicy, but that made it even better. I was too full from eating this at the time to review it ;), but I just found my page that I obviously laid my spoon on!! :rofl: Thanks so much!!"
452355,373834,2009-06-11,4,"We enjoyed this pork loin tonight and thought the combination of spices in the rub was very nice and complimented the Dijon coating well. Our roast came out perfectly tender. Both DH and I liked the rubbed pork loin itself alot more than we liked the sauce. DH picked the best package of blackberries he could find at the store, but I am wondering if some were over-ripe/bitter? I'm not sure. I followed all directions and ingredients as posted and used a Sauvingon Blanc for the white wine and Grey Poupon Dijon. All in all, we enjoyed our meal tonight. We served with Recipe #133416 133416 and Recipe #159516 159516 as sides. Made for ZWT5. Thanks!"
1202780,364842,2011-04-16,0,I was looking for something to make for Easter with my in-laws. I did a test run with this and it was so amazingingly good!!! I can't wait to make this for them. :)    ^^^ I also want to add that it does seem like a lot of steps but honestly it's not much more than your standard Holiday main dish. And the work is totally worth it.
93006,109310,2008-06-15,5,"We abslolutely love this rice...goes great with any grilled meat.  Versatile, flavorful and absolutely delicious!"
601528,307682,2008-06-19,5,"To quote my husband, ""You outdid yourself again tonight.  A restaurant quality meal.""  I finely diced the celery but followed the recipe exactly otherwise and the result was a very moist and lemony dish that looked fabulous.  Thanks Sydney Mike!"
2001144918,268243,2016-10-30,5,"This is a fabulous recipe! I did not have vanilla, so used 1/4 tsp of almond extract and it really upped the flavor of the chocolate, fantastic! It spreads beautifully without melting. Consistency and taste like the inside of a Lindt truffle, but really spreads so well on cake and holds its shape! To those who didn't have success, you do have to constantly stir, then remove from heat as soon as you see it start to thicken; it will continue to thicken a bit off heat, keep stirring! This will be my go to frosting recipe!"
705251,209187,2008-02-21,4,Very nice recipe - quick and simple to make. Used small cubed chicken and served over brown rice.  I added some sliced carrots to this too - this is something a local restaurant does with their sweet 'n sour and we've come to love the flavor.  Made for Bevy Tag Cupid's Choice Tag Game Feb '08.  Thanks Sydney Mike!
2001759518,131607,2017-10-21,5,Definitely the best I've ever made! Thank you!! Will have to track down some cornmeal to see if it elevates this recipe even further.
138429,42247,2005-05-02,5,There will never be a bottle of store bought vanilla in my house again.I started this in Nov. and added a couple of extra beans but it has been ready for a while. I plan on starting another batch to have ready to give for Christmas gifts. This  would be a wonderful hostess gift at any time of the year. A very treasured recipe. Thank-you
325572,27887,2006-06-14,5,HA!  This recipe is perfect...so easy.  Tastes great and saves you the trouble and mess of mixing drinks for a crowd.  I just used a frozen can of fruit punch to save a little money (not that it makes much of a difference with the rum $).  Served it a couple times now...no complaints!  I do love rum...thanks for the recipe.
68357,49057,2003-04-05,5,"Yummy.  I hae jumbo shrimp, so chopped them in quarters. I didn't have have Athens patty shells so made my own pastries (36), made half of the recipe, and they were delicious!  Since I had some  sauce left over after filling shells, I added a few more cooked shrimp and plan to serve them over hot grits.  The sauce (cook on medium low) is very creamy and delicious.  Yum."
846665,89204,2010-09-02,5,"So, I know this recipe already has over 1000 reviews, but seriously I must say this is the best thing EVER!!  I put it in tortillas with a little shredded cheddar.  Fantastic!  Also, I added a can of fire roasted tomatoes and they are great in it.  Husband put over rice and loved it, kids LOVED it in the tortillas.  Thank you so much!!!"
489929,25885,2007-05-24,0,"This didn't have the flavor that I was expecting.  Pretty mellow...though I only had 3 small banana's. That is probably why mine was dry.

I did add baking powder and 1 cup of brown sugar."

589801,68435,2008-08-08,5,"Wish I had some rum to make a daquiri out of this!  It is terrific.  I served it in a martini glass, so pretty.  Think I'll use the rest of my watermelon on this recipe."
1802498060,180878,2014-02-17,5,Thank you for sharing this recipe. I was craving some vegan mac and cheese from a vegan spot soul vegetarian but they closed it here in DC. I made this recipe tonight and it was the best! It tasted like it was from a restaurant! I made it with barbecue tofu and collard greens. This recipe is the best!
104295,239432,2008-09-18,4,Made this as a OAMC meal that I made and froze before the school year began.  Baked it at 425 with some extra cheese on top.  It took a really long time to bake for us and was just a tad dry.  It was good classic mac & cheese.  I left out the peas and use chopped ham.  Thanks for an easy dinner.
2001359022,259913,2017-01-20,5,This has become a go-to recipe for me - thank you!
77595,65543,2003-08-25,4,"I am not a zuccini lover, but my sister made this and everyone in my family loved it. we will keep this one for the books"
199848,233112,2008-04-20,5,"Colorful and delicious.  I loved the cheesy sauce, the colorful veggies and the sweet crunch of the corn.  I used the oven method and it was worth the wait.   Thanx for posting this new favorite of ours!"
90432,65538,2006-04-05,4,Very good!  Just added some flour to thicken it up towards to end!
921940,96771,2010-12-31,5,"Maybe I'm more adventurous than most of the other reviewers, but I LOVE this chili.  It has been the only recipe I've used for the past couple of years, because it is so good.  I have noticed that if I don't follow the recipe correctly, it doesn't turn out as well, and I must admit to leaving out the adobos because it is too spicy for us otherwise (perhaps that makes the difference between my opinion and the others?)  Thanks for posting it, now I don't have to worry about losing my copy."
1363412,302025,2009-08-25,5,"These are excellent scones. Light and fluffy. I did have some problems with the moisture content of the pumpkin, requiring closer to 3 cups of flour to bring the dough together, but the end result was still very nice. I also added some nutmeg to the mixture and sprinkled over the scones before baking. The smell in the kitchen was divine.... Looking forward to a cup of coffee and some scones. Thanks spo_rt :)"
166068,29561,2004-11-17,5,"I added about 1/2 t. almond extract-they seemed a little plain. They tasted awesome, my kids are making a second batch as we speak (10:00 pm on a school night). I put them in cupcake tins with melted chocolate in the bottom. I am going to make them in mini cupcake papers for Christmas trays. Thanks a lot!!"
1803274076,49534,2015-02-03,5,"I made these this week, and will make again soon! I had an idea that i thought i would make them even yummier, and they turned out fantastic! I thought i would give them a carmel-like taste by browning the butter first-- and my husband said they were his favorite! I melted the butter on the stovetop letting it become amber in color (there will be brown bits in the bottom of the pan). I let the butter cool, and then strained it into the sugars before blending leaving most of the brown bits in the pan (a few escaping into the cookie batter is okay :) ). I used a wire whisk to blend the sugars and wet ingredients, and stirred the dry ingredients in with a wooden spoon-- no beaters needed-- yay! i didn&#039;t need to refrigerate my dough either, and they turned out awesome! I set my oven on 375 degrees and baked for 10-12 minutes (as my original Snickerdoodle recipe calls for.) Hope this is useful! Kelle Eigsti (aka. BeachGirlBakes)"
865936,503439,2013-09-06,4,This was very good and different from anything I&#039;ve had before.  It also was great to pack for taking to work.
388414,134775,2007-02-03,5,"I don't think you can get any easier than this! I don't think they can taste any better than this.. My husband watched me make these and kept asking ""Umm, are you sure your doing it right?"" Funny how all I heard out of his mouth when they were done is ""Ohhh, You gotta make these more often!""  

My husuband is one to put butter/jam on everything, these biscuits he ate  just as they were and loved em'... I am sooo happy I found this recipe.. No more store bought for our family, from NOW ON!!"
2001554914,69630,2017-05-26,0,"I've made this recipe many times in the past with great results. The last two ro three times I've made it, it falls in the middle just before it's done baking and I can't figure out why. I use an oven thermometer to verify temp, follow the recipe precisely, weigh the ingredients, etc. Can any one ive me any advice. I absolutely love the flavor and texture of this cake and am getting frustrated with the results. Any advice would be appreciated."
527607,133436,2007-07-06,4,"Excellent!!  Im not sure my canned tomatoes were the best choice for this, but it will be easily taken care of by using some fresh cilantro next time to perk it up.

I will not buy store bought salsa again."
860084,149395,2011-12-19,5,"I made this last night with a 6.5 rib roast in a gas oven. I cooked it an hour, left it in for 3 hours and then cooked it another 30 mins and it turned out medium rare. Perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth delicious!!!!"
11297,142543,2006-02-10,5,I ended up freezing mine for about 8 hours and I found this was toooo long.  It was very hard. I prefered it before it had frozen solid (yes I did try some LOL). I also think this would be great unfrozen erved over some fresh berries. Is certainly going into my keeper file and sister in law has gone home with the recipe.:)
215057,184634,2007-01-27,2,"This was ok. 
Guess I'm not much on Custard - it wasn't ""hard"" to make but it looked pretty nasty when done. It tasted better than it looked, but that really isn't saying a whole lot. But - and this is a big but - my friend Bruce liked the flavor and the consistancy. I wouldn't fix it for myself ever again, but would fix it for him anytime.
Sorry, personally 2 stars was all I could muster."
58104,418875,2010-04-26,4,This is for mint lovers. I would cut back on the mint by half. It did feel good going down. Soothing my sore throat. Thanks for the good drinks! ;)
1200659,185689,2009-03-21,4,this was very good and easy to make. my family liked it. will make it again.
4470,62317,2004-02-29,5,"5 star all the way. I used cream cheese with sundried tomato. I found that by making each pattie 1/2 inch thick that the hamburgers were too fat (1"") & stubby so I made each 1/4 inch thick ending up with a 1/2"" hamburger filled with the cream cheese mixture.  Loved the flavor from the herb/garlic soup mix.  I topped the burger with lettuce tomato & cheese, grilled mushrooms on the side and Baking stone fries - terrific Saturday night dinner.  Thanks Tish loved this recipe"
341170,268199,2008-08-24,5,What a great way to have stew without the expense of stewing beef! I used pre-cooked with peppers and onions ground beef. I used french onion soup mix and found it made it taste just like mom's stew! I think this will become a crock pot staple in my house!
1011811,291997,2008-12-05,0,"This recipe is outstanding. I omitted the sugar, which I don't eat. I may have used a sprinkle of stevia. Also, I read the recipe wrong and used 3 whole eggs, and I added 2 tsp of baking powder. Pure perfection and way better than anything frozen you buy GF/YF anywhere!
Thank you. maximezara"
363055,225300,2011-03-15,5,The best yet.  These will  be my favorite potatoes to make for serving with fish and sandwiches.
59403,89258,2004-09-23,4,I made this cake for a dinner party.  I let it sit for three days and I was quite impressed by how moist it was.  I did have to put the frosting in the freezer to speed things up.  The end result was a great tasting cake that I will make again.
237123,93223,2005-08-21,5,Just what I was looking for... a simple recipe with the basics that I can add on to if I want.  Thanks!!
1329782,229096,2009-09-27,3,"I like the method as make scallops almost every week.  I just thought I would try, but needed seasoning.  Seriously lacked taste.  the scallops wee good as I thoght but no taste.  Salt, pepper, seasoning, something.  The cooking method was right on, GREAT! But no flavor, sorry.  I loved the method and very good.  but needs taste to me.  I'm sorry."
344231,370667,2009-05-14,5,"In a word...HEAVEN!  If lemons are your thing, take a few minutes and whip up this delicious lemon spread.  The first time I made it, I forgot to add the butter (and everyone loved it anyway).  I've gone back and redone it with the butter and it's only slightly less lemony but is more creamy.  This is going to be a staple in our fridge from now on!  Made for ZWT 5!  (-:  Thanks Island Gurl."
1326429,145747,2009-10-26,5,"these are lovely.  i made 2 batches for a large party - one with a homemade cranberry sauce and one with brown sugar and walnuts sprinkled over the cheese.  i prepared them a few hours ahead of time and kept them in the fridge covered in aluminum foil.  everyone loved them and had no idea how easy they were to make.

i'm definitely going to make these again and will try different combinations.  but the cranberry variety will definitely be back for christmas!"
56003,387963,2009-09-08,4,"Thank you, Mortadella, for finally helping me make a decent everyday kind of gravy.  This was way easy.  I did make a couple of changes, as I wanted to make a brown gravy. I omitted the chicken bouillon and also the sage. I did use a few shakes of Worchestershire sauce.  I added my cooked beef tips and let the whole thing simmer for about 30 minutes.  Delicious!  Thnx, Mortadella, for posting your recipe.  Made for PAC Fall 2009."
270477,50824,2005-12-14,5,"Very good-tasting and pretty easy.  The sauce is easily made from things most people have on hand, which is nice. I added cannelini (white beans-drained) and frozen corn kernels, and omitted mushrooms. Garnished with cilantro. A cross between enchiladas and burrios. "
2133335,148007,2012-01-03,0,"I was also intrigued by the movie and got a Dutch Oven for Christmas - so - I was off to cook this recipe.  I had no idea how labor-intensive it was - but well worth the time and effort.  This is a definite ""will do again"" recipe....."
28346,56416,2003-04-20,5,"Wow, typing after having a few of these makes for a real challenge, especially since I totally forgot the pineapple juice.  Still tastes good though, but you wouldn't be able to interpret what I've written if I hadn't read through it and done some serious editing.  This is a drink for those with a strong constitution! (and a good sense of humor for the afer-affects).  "
125773,81712,2005-09-20,5,"This is such an easy recipe. I followed the recipe and would not change a thing. YUMMY!!!!
Thank you for posting. I just wish I would have had left overs to take for lunch tomorrow. :)"
88099,210349,2007-09-16,4,"OMG this is so rich and filling.  Loved the flavor.  The texture was a little softer than I would have liked, but Dave loved it.  So easy to put together too.  thanks"
133174,110631,2005-06-05,5,"When I converted this to US measurements, it said I needed 5 1/3 cups--no way.  I used 4 cups and the risotto was nice and creamy.  I did not use the bouillon cubes but used a soup base instead.  Added a little more paprika than the recipe called for and yes topped it off with the ""good"" parmesan cheese.  DS paid this the highest compliment of all as he took leftovers home with him.  :)"
222564,292029,2014-01-15,5,Simple things are the best!
52282,59356,2003-04-19,5,"this is one of my favorite drinks! i have to special order the cachaca , the brand name is pitu, but it is well worth it, this is refreshing and potent. the trick is to mash the sugar into the lime with a spoon, add the cachaca and then add the ice and lots of it."
26657,13388,2004-04-15,5,"I made this for breakfast Easter morning for 19 people. Absolutly no complaints from anyone. Everyone, including my picky daughter loved this one! I also made the Grand Marnier Sauce(recipe # 52907)to top the toast off with if anyone desired. It's a keeper and soooo easy!! "
921940,74275,2010-01-03,4,"I made this as is, only adding carrots to the soup.  It was good, my intention was to add turkey bacon and paprika as well, but I forgot.  A great basic soup, super easy to make.  We had a bunch of people over for New Year's Day and this was one of the soups I made, everyone really liked it and I had a request from one of the guests for the recipe.  Thanks!"
39301,19725,2003-08-07,5,"Terrific tender chops!  Like the others, I allowed to simmer for about an hour to get the sauce nicely thickened.  This is a great recipe - easy, flavorful and virtually fool-proof.  Thanks!"
96177,109607,2008-02-04,5,"Fantastic. I added about 8 oz. of smoked sausage cut in 1"" cubes. Quick and easy, with superb taste."
1086570,174022,2014-06-07,5,This is a stone cold winner. Super easy and pretty.we followed the recipe down to the last word. we did put the watermelon in a colander to drain before putting everything together. Love the moderate heat from the peppers. This will be a summer regular. Thanks for the recipe
1802911052,351631,2014-07-09,0,"This is a fantastic recipe! I&#039;ve never reviewed a recipe before, but felt compelled to after trying this one. I used the ingredients, and measurements listed, including a good-quality pinot grigio. The only tweak I made was to follow what a previous reviewer suggested - pour the wine on the fish before adding the rub. My Husband and I thought this was better than any sea bass entr&eacute;e we&#039;ve ever had at a restaurant."
55122,38298,2003-11-13,5,"WONDERFUL!  I had this soup at Olive Garden and vowed to go straight home to look for the recipe.  Found it here and WOW, my new favorite soup!  Made it exactly as instructed in recipe with kale.  MMMMMMMMM!!! Good! "
706176,27945,2009-05-05,5,"I love these!!! Had tonight with crockpot roast and green beans-quick, easy and delicious! I did add 1/4 tsp Italian seasoning to the mix before baking, but kept the rest of the recipe the same. Thanks for a great one!"
14410,413789,2010-02-23,0,"I won't give any stars, since this was my own fault....skim milk by itself doesn't make good ricotta...it makes rubber! I will try this again with whole milk. Just FYI."
102441,37968,2004-06-11,5,"This was an excellent meal.  It was a great big hit with my family.  After tasting it, I called my mom and gave the recipe to her.  She made it the next night and loved it just as much.  I served it over noodles the first night and the leftovers over white rice.  I liked it with the rice better, but the noodles were good too.  My 4 year old gobbled it up and asked for more.  I only had cream of celery in the cupboard, so that's what I used.  I also added approx. 8 oz. of sour cream to cut the spice for my kiddo.  I was also a little short on chicken, so I chopped up the chicken after cooking and it turned into a ""sauce"".  The best part of the recipe is that it was SO EASY.  I cooked on low for 7 hours and kept the crock on warm for several more hours so my husband could have a hot meal after getting off work late.  Thank you for the day off!!!"
1530765,46739,2017-06-25,3,"Made this for dinner last night because of all the rave reviews. I did substitute apple cider for the pineapple juice because I don't like pineapple and never have it on hand. Spiked the sauce with a squeeze of both lime and orange juice to capture that island taste. Otherwise, I pretty much followed the recipe. It was okay. Just your average Asian-type sweet &amp; sour sauce/glaze. Certainly nothing swoon worthy about it. We ate it and rated it as not bad. Got some sauce leftover but don't like it enough to use it on anything else. Sorry, not impressed!"
86318,396334,2013-04-18,5,"This is delicious! And very easy to make, even if you made the noodles from scratch, like me. I will confess to not paying a lot of attention to the amounts of the ingredients. I used all the ingredients, but did add them in amounts that were convenient for me. The only thing I changed was about 1 tablespoon minced fresh coriander leaves at the very end of the cooking. Thank you very much for posting this lovely recipe."
49561,47647,2008-08-15,5,Tried this last week and it was very good.  Taste a little like jambalya.  Even the hubby liked it and said it tastes as good the next day.  Thanks for a keeper.
431813,169980,2007-07-12,5,"This was very tasty!  We really enjoyed all the different textures.  I was a little unsure of the chestnuts, but their sweetness balanced nicely with the saltiness of the bacon.  Excellent risotto!  Thanks Leslie!"
225114,93426,2012-04-08,5,We really liked this bread.  The only thing I did different was add 1/2 t of vanilla and 3/4 t of cinnamon.  I will make this again for sure - it is very filling and not too sweet.
1057358,440408,2011-06-01,5,"This turkey burger was delicious, moist and flavourful. I've added it to my favorites."
269243,76864,2007-05-15,5,"Excellent!
I followed the tips for the filling and added 2 TBSP of flour to it.

I've also tried adding pecan pieces to the filling and it comes out great!"
264630,41486,2007-04-16,4,This recipe reminded me of the breaded pork chops my mom used to fix when I was younger. My new comfort food. I actually was able to use this recipe for 8 cutlets. Also 1/2 cup of egg beaters works really well instead of the 2 eggs.
486725,3400,2009-02-23,5,"These were delicious and very flavorful! I think the balsamic is completely responsible for that. I halved the oil and added a clove of garlic to the marinade. We grated parmesan cheese on top when they came off the grill (maybe less than what is called for), and it immediately melted, so we didn't need to cook them with the cheese on them. This makes for a great side dish!"
81611,165578,2006-05-07,4,"These were fun to make and present, but the combo of bbq and carrots, esp. with the cajun, was just too much for me. I did some with different seasoning than cajun, and that wasn't as strange. I did LOVE how the chicken was SOOO tender cooked this way. I also put some red and green peppers on top of the onions, and it was a nice boost of color. I also like how everything cooks all at once. And if anyone was able to do this without burning the very bottom of the potatoes, I'd like to hear how to do that. Thanks."
383346,251492,2007-09-18,3,"I think something was missing, maybe oil, butter or applesauce.  It was hard to mix so I added a little bit of applesauce and milk.  Maybe a little bit of vanilla would be good.  Made for PAC Fall 2007"
94272,114708,2005-03-31,5,"Queenie, malt vinegar is FABULOUS on freshly made fries! My mother was from New England; I grew up putting vinegar on EVERYTHING (though she used mainly cider vinegar). To me, the perfect accompaniment to those fries (besides the outdoors) is those fiendish, sweet little clam cakes we used to get near Newport, Rhode Island at a little stand called ""Johnny's""... thanks for posting this recipe!"
462571,189482,2010-11-13,5,Easy for kids to make and it has great crunch.
222139,441931,2012-03-19,5,Thanks to pic a chef I picked this recipe to try.<br/><br/>There are no words to say but Yumm!<br/><br/>What a nice coffee cake to try and have any time of day.<br/><br/>We chose to have this for breakfast.<br/><br/>We also agree 10 Stars
181319,78897,2005-06-27,5,"I made this this evening and as others have said, it was quite easy.  I thought I had tomato sauce but I did not so I used a can of diced tomatoes instead.  We are not fans of kidney beans so I substituted black beans.  Next time I might add a bit more moisture to the hamburger layer as the cornmeal seemed to absorb it all - but yes, there will definitely be a next time.  Thank you Fluffy for the fine recipe!"
29404,138528,2006-02-24,5,"Proof that you can go back.  My gosh, I'm thinking 10 years at least.  This was good, very very close, just a little salty for my taste, but husband thought it perfect.  Ty for recipe
"
248029,14384,2006-11-25,5,"I have a similar recipe...we use 1 cup pecans. We whip tbe heavy cream to stiff peaks and then fold in the mini marshmallows and let it sit for at 2 hrs or overnight. Tip: if you freeze your cranberries before you mince them its much easier. When it comes time to mix the two mixtures together we lightly drain the pineapple and fold everything together. We usually get to this point the next morning. This is a special holiday dish, because that is the only time they have fresh cranberries in the store. My mother-in-law use to make this for my husband every holiday, its been 14 years and he has not missed a holiday without this salad."
60992,48827,2004-02-15,5,"These cookies are incredibly rich! While they are easy to make, I mixed them by hand which reminded why I love my KitchenAid sooo much! Instead of butterscotch chips I used Heath bars toffee pieces, just to add to the richness! They are so rich I could only eat 1 cookie! DH had NO problem however. They looked like Pecan Sandies to us, but SO much better! DH has already asked me to make these again!"
500860,52999,2016-08-26,4,I really really liked these chewy pancakes! Excellent with butter and maple syrup.
56112,95012,2004-07-08,5,"Once again, Sharon123, you have come through with a great veggie recipe.  I have grilled corn before, but never with the lemon juice.  Thanks for the great recipe."
778986,190097,2008-09-17,5,"Kitten, my oldest Daughter wanted some popcorn balls for her grandson's school. Since I am retired I told her I could handle that job! Found this recipe! This recipe is also on another website. After checking dates, they must have copied yours! They are identical! However, I made them and they are fantastic! I used a large dishpan, buttered my hands and they were done! Thanks for another winner. This is a keeper and so easy!"
661999,303911,2012-01-01,5,This was a great salad for a potluck.  It looked fantastic and the addition of the avocado and salsa verde gave it a different(and tasty) spin from the usual layered salads.  Will definitely make again.
242766,111047,2006-08-06,5,"This was very good. It went together very quickly and easily. It didn't seem to make a lot of gravy in relation to the amount of sausage, so next time I will double the gravy ingredients (not the sausage) to get more gravy. Also, I will use low-sodium chicken broth to reduce the saltiness. My family enjoyed this and I will be making it again. Thank you for sharing."
227978,21881,2014-01-24,5,"Thanks, MizzNezz.  This was quite delicious, and so easy to make (much easier than a regular skillet omelet).  And I can see recipe would lend itself well to variations, adding different ingredients to change the flavor according to our mood.  I&#039;ll definitely keep this recipe handy and make it when everyone requests omelets for breakfast again.  That way, everyone can get their breakfast at the same time, saving me the trouble of making everyone&#039;s omelet, one by one.  Made for the Bet of 2013 tag game."
27678,21087,2004-07-01,5,"What a nice, simple recipe for swiss chard. I loved it and made it exactly as written."
109303,31292,2005-04-02,4,"Wow!  These were quick, easy and tasty.  I made some changes.  I used a can spinach and cornflake crumbs since that's what I had on hand.  I also thought two eggs were enough since I baked them at 450.  I added some red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning.  I can't wait to make these again with spaghetti.  "
119481,65931,2004-09-18,5,Awesome!!!  This was THE drink of our Gulf Shores vacation over Spring Break.  My husband mixed up more of these than he can count!!!
199792,52253,2007-10-23,5,"This is one fine recipe! I have never made this type of dumpling before and we really enjoyed the little devils. I did have to make a few changes because of what I had on hand. To start with I only made a half recipe and used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I used part water and part chicken broth as I thought the 'stock' would be a little weak without the rest of the chicken! I didn't have any celery so threw in a bit of celery salt. I used about 3 carrots cut into rounds. I did seem to run a bit short of stock so next time will increase that a bit. However, the flavour is wonderful. My family says it is a keeper and we thank you for sharing your recipe."
2197272,325571,2014-03-14,1,"I so love this method that I have been spreading the word and lent out my book-hence my research to find the master boule recipe  I used the Metric weights given here (ml) and can only say that they were weigh, WEIGH out!  This would have been a total waste of ingredients and time except for the fact that I make this dough/bread every week or two (we cannot buy good bread on this tiny island) so I knew how sticky the dough should be. Please review your metric measurements."
157102,272650,2008-08-06,4,"This is good. I used chopped walnuts. Also, I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and added a splash of milk. Very tasty! I like the caramelized flavor given by the brown sugar."
296809,283073,2008-03-22,5,"Just wonderful, Lorie! Due to a DH pers pref (silly man), I made mine w/o the streusel topping so can only imagine what it might add. The muffins were excellent & the strawberry butter divine ~~ a very well-deserved RSC winner thx to your creative genius!"
1925885,307536,2014-09-15,4,"This was a good chimichurri sauce and will make it again. But, will slightly reduce the vinegar, as it was a bit too much for us. We don&#039;t eat much meat, so we just pan-fried a New York strip to rare, then thinly sliced it to share between the two of us.  Made for Culinary Quest 2014."
2720964,259563,2013-03-03,5,"They were pretty similar tasting to famous dave's, but whether they were or not, they were fabulous!!! Made them tonight for my future mother-in-law's birthday dinner and everyone loved them and were super impressed!!! and it was super easy!!!"
133174,333380,2008-12-05,5,"A delicious winter meal.  I started out to reduce the recipe by half but probably ended up using more squash than intended.  The squash was approximately 1 1/2 to 2 pounds in weight and was peeled, cubed and drizzled with a touch of olive oil then seasoned with salt and pepper before roasting at 400 degrees.  The squash was fork tender and ready to add to the mix in about 20 minutes.  The sausage was Aidell's brand chicken and apple which was diced. I do not cook with wine and used additional chicken stock. The dish was served with a tomato salad."
207616,65931,2008-07-19,5,"This was so absolutely scrumptious! Reading the other reviews about sweetness I decided to put about 1/4 tsp of butterscotch schnapps in here and used it on the rim with the graham crackers. I mixed turbinado sugar with the cracker crumbs and it was just absolutely WONDERFUL! Thanx Rita for a great recipe for my new love, Licor 43!"
54678,84038,2007-09-24,4,We added more vegies and used some sort of Japanese noodles. I think I enjoyed it more than the rest of the family.
17803,274172,2011-03-28,4,Very easy to make. I forgot to add the tomato juice so the cabbage taste was strong. All the kids liked this and most asked for seconds.  The next day I added some tomato juice in with my soup and it tasted much butter.  Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup
131126,173165,2006-06-20,4,"I greatly reduced the amount of ingredients here to make a smaller salad and used splenda in place of the sugar. I wasn't crazy about the wine, but I thought everything else was very nice. On the other hand DH loved it and rated it 5 stars. Thank you for sharing your recipe! â "
676702,199612,2008-11-29,5,"This was the moisted turkey I have ever eaten. Even my own Mother could not believe how moist it was. Best part was the following day, still nice and moist, not dryed out. I cooked a 15 lb bird, unstuffed, with 5 cups of chicken broth didn't need to add more. Thanks Kitten for yet another outstanding recipe!"
191533,29598,2013-05-20,3,"Good, not extraordinary. I didn&#039;t think the long marinating made much difference. Served with bbq sauce, and used leftover chicken in a salad."
562865,110683,2010-02-15,4,Good recipe. I used a blend of fat free yogurt and oil to cut down on the fat and it worked out nicely.  I would reccomend sifting the flour to ensure batter isn't over mixed.  Thanks for sharing.
80353,315228,2013-07-14,5,Loved all the different flavours working on the creamy/salty feta.
2002116210,367963,2018-04-15,5,"Amazing and super easy! I used Costcoâs Seafood Medley, added hot pepper flakes, extra garlic, chopped cilantro, and some leftover seafood paella we had in the fridge. I will definitely make this again! Thank you! :-)"
1981542,185297,2011-08-13,5,Wow this is a great and the most simplistic cookie recipe ever! Thank you for this. I was nervous to try it at first but from all the reviews it seemed like a good idea to try out. I did use less splenda as others have suggested (about just under 1/2 cup) and with the Splenda Blend mix - sweetener and sugar. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of baking soda. <br/><br/>Also on a few cookies I sprinkled cinnamon on top just before putting it in the oven and that turned out awesome! I'll try the brown sugar next time. Danke!
2001281572,214223,2016-12-04,0,Delicious!!
29196,235186,2008-04-04,4,"This is really delicious-rich, but delicious! I used hot salsa, but would have liked more of a kick so would use a tablespoon or two of chopped pickled jalapenos next time. Next time I think I'd skip the cheese in the middle too. It wouln't be missed and would cut back on the oily finish."
286566,230919,2007-07-16,4,"Voting ranged from 3 to 5 so it is middle ground and a 4.  I like Peter J cooked in the oven, turning frequently.  I dipped the breasts in the marinade and then in the baking dish and pouring the excess marinade over the lot.  Cooked a total of 45 minutes, the first 15 with the lid on the dish, turning and continue to cook without the lid, turning a third time with 15 minutes to go.  I enjoyed the sweetness and slight saltiness of the mix.  Thank you Mandy from Oz for a nice easy tasty mid week recipe.  Made for 123 Hit Wonders tag game."
2000671165,261889,2015-11-12,5,"Let me say, I am far from a talented baker, but the cookies would suggest otherwise. They were tested on a class of med students and a class of masters students, and neither class left a single cookie. It&#039;s always a good sign when people come back and ask for seconds! I will be making these again, and again, and again."
690623,171325,2012-07-25,5,This is OMG good!  I am snacking on my second tortilla as I type this.  I was a little concerned that the onions would overpower the cheese.  Not so!  The herbs shouldn't be omitted either - they really add to the flavour without being 'in your face'.  I made it exactly as written using a double cream Brie and Granny Smith apples and wouldn't change a thing.  How much better can a recipe get?  It was quick and easy with a wonderful taste.  I'll be making these many times in the future.  Made for the Bistro Babes - ZWT 8
325054,44223,2006-07-03,5,Great flavor!  I used turkey instead of chicken and put it on the grill.  I froze the other half for later... can't wait to enjoy it again!
137165,64373,2007-06-24,3,A very good meal on a fall evening.
426903,144728,2007-10-31,4,"My husband and I both really liked this meal, however it was more spicy than we had anticipated. I think next time we will use less red pepper. But it satisfied us, and it was healthy! Thanks for posting."
187705,51876,2006-07-03,5,"This ia absolutely great! I had to make a couple of substitutions (ketchup for the tomato paste, onion powder for the shallot, dried herbs for the fresh). I would definitely recommend this recipe for anyone looking for something different. I also ended up making it on the stove instead of the grill. No problem at all. I served it with the Skillet Tortellini recipe which was a nice accompaniment. Lori J"
58038,78145,2004-01-05,5,"Excellent.  This sounds so wierd.  I mean, really, who makes a dish around celery?  But it is great.  DH and I ate almost the whole batch.  We had a bit too much butter but think it has more to do with the amount celery than anything else.  We will be having this again!  Thanks."
494867,379008,2010-04-17,5,"Fantastic soup! I admit that I usually don't make soup until I notice the vegetable drawer needs some attention. But this soup is so good that I'll be buying broccoli just for this recipe. Heck, I might even plant broccoli in the garden hoping for a bumper crop and then needed to freeze gallons of this soup! I used almond milk in place of soy milk, Bragg's for the soy sauce and 2 tsp of dried basil.  Was just perfect. Thanks!!"
846905,90390,2010-01-11,5,Fantastic!!!!!
68460,98518,2005-06-19,5,I used most of this recipe for a dinner for my daughter and myself and we loved it.  I didn't prepare the sauce....my daughter isn't into sauce and this dinner was for her (it was just the two of us) so I didn't bother.  I marinated the chicken and grilled it....served with broccoli and garlic bread.  I'm going to make this again for my husband and myself and make the sauce!!  Thanks B for the great recipe :)  Judy
2001641327,13214,2017-07-25,5,i use vodka instead of bourboon
424680,201095,2007-04-11,5,"Great tasting little nuggets of pumpkin, which I'll definitely be making again & again! Have added them to my finger foods cookbook, so that I don't forget to include them on an appetizers buffet for the next group I host! OUTSTANDING!"
89831,239114,2008-05-28,5,"sometimes simple recipes are just the best! I also added in 2 good tablespoons chopped fresh garlic a sprinkle of kosher salt and used lots freshly ground pepper, we really enjoyed this Liza thank you hon!"
349476,138566,2008-02-20,5,"This recipe is WONDERFUL!! My kids and my cousin's son ask me to make this every week end. I add a tsp of cinnamon for taste and I use Hershey's Dark Cocoa, the combination is awesome. Thanks for posting!! :)"
2001219586,433068,2018-02-06,5,"By far the easiest and tastiest crust recipe I've made. I used canned peaches, adding my ingredients(pure vanilla extract, pure orange extract, pure lemon extract, brown sugar, white sugar, butter, and cinnamon) and cooking them until &quot;pie ready.&quot; The crust was simply amazing! I loved the idea of it starting on the bottom and rising to the top. The pie was done in about 35 minutes. This crust is a keeper! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!"
132252,120366,2006-02-10,5,This tasted great and was so easy! I prepared everything except the dumplings in the morning so it made for a very fast dessert for company. The nutmeg sauce is beyond wonderful and I can't think of anything it wouldn't taste good on! Thanks for this recipe! 
17803,61069,2006-05-24,5,"This marinade for pork is just fantastic and we only had enough time to marinade for 30 minutes.  Just imagine what the flavor well be after 48 hours.  I can't wait to try this again and marinade our tenderloins for the full 48 hours.  This is a real keeper that I'll be sharing with my friends!  Oh yes, I'll even share this one with our butcher in town.  "
18660,16769,2002-09-30,5,This dish is not for the faint of tongue! I love spicy food and it was almost too much for me. I used Enoki and Shitake mushrooms in place of the eggplant and I added some shrimp too. It was delicious. Vegetarians could add more more vegetables and this would be a delicious meatless dish. The sauce made 1 1/3 cups and I reserved 1/2 cup to stir fry with. If you were to use just veggies this would probably be just the right amount. The Soba noodles helped with the heat some.
1052207,64246,2009-04-24,5,"Great way to use up leftover chicken, went well with the Aioli and tasted yummy."
228458,451168,2011-04-21,4,"This is a fun change of pace from our usual roasted potatoes! We are a vinegar loving family, so it is right up our alley. I served it with homemade fish fingers and sauteed veggies, and I have to admit that I enjoyed the sauce on my fish even more than on my potatoes! Thanks for posting; I will likely make the sauce often when I serve fish! Made for PRMR."
852269,225983,2008-12-22,4,"I was looking for Christmas color cocktails and decided to ty this. I made it as you suggested (same proportions), AND added a little blue Curacao (about 1/2 oz.) to amp up the green colour. I am enjoying it now and will have at Christmas for my guests"
159331,111269,2005-09-30,5,Loved this! I made it just like the recipe and it was yummy! My kids gobbled them up. I will definately be making this for lunches or appetizers in the future.
1575736,28943,2010-12-26,5,"Great recipe and REALLY easy to work with. I subbed half with cold butter. Wrapped in in Saran wrap for two days before I needed it. Let it sit out about 25 min before I needed it, and found it really easy to work with. Thanks so much! My recipe trials stop here!"
74281,60402,2009-07-25,5,I love Linguini with Clam sauce but with tight budgets these days paying $14 for one person makes it just an occasional treat..... Until now! This is definitely a restaurant quality recipe and the only change I made was to double the olive oil and spices (but not the clams) as we like ours pretty saucy. With this recipe and Chef #369715 's Recipe #251583 we had a great meal for under $10 and in less than 30 minutes.
56112,114168,2005-06-24,4,"Had this for lunch today, made with fresh broccoli, and it was simple delicious.  I did cut back on the capers just a little, but that was just a personal preference.  Thanks for the great recipe."
719083,46780,2008-11-28,5,This was delicious! I ended up making it sugar-free by substituting 1 cup splenda for sugar and an almond crust for a graham cracker crust. It was a great thanksgiving treat that is sure to be used again and again.
179642,20624,2007-05-29,5,"Made this for dinner tonight and even my garlic hating husband loved it.  I sliced the chicken breasts in half so they would be thinner and then marinated it in some olive oil, big chunks of garlic and lemon before cooking it because I had some extra time on my hands.  I also tripled the juice so that we could have plenty of extra to put on the rice I made as a side dish.  Excellent!"
46273015,128566,2014-11-06,5,I love this recipe and so does my husband! The moment he tasted it he said &quot;omg kfc has nothing on this!&quot; I&#039;ve made it twice now once the way the recipe states and the second time with the milk and sour cream in place of half and half. I think I liked it better the first time. I use corn starch in place of flour so the filling will be super thick. I didn&#039;t do that the second time (I forgot) so maybe that was the big difference in it. Overall this is an amazing recipe and one that I&#039;ll be using over and over. Thanks for adding it breezermom!
377161,219466,2010-02-14,5,"A great potato recipe!! Made to go with steak and the potatoes turned out delicious!! I did add
some bacon bits I had leftover from a salad I was making and that was good too. Will definitely
make again and this time I will leave out the bacon bits. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!"
146021,12656,2004-08-07,5,"I made this tonight.  I had purchased two live Dungeness crab and cooked them.  This was fabulous.  I didn't have Swiss cheese so I used Camembert.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

I served it with wild rice and a salad."
496803,232601,2007-09-19,5,"This was the most helpful post EVER!!  Thank you so much for these clear, concise directions for doing a nasty, yet vital task.  I'll refer back to them often, until I feel confident with my skill at disecting a chicken."
57222,61195,2008-10-08,5,"Mm-mm-mm! So very gingery they burn the back of your throat ever so slightly in a very pleasure-enhancing way...  (This could be a function of my candied ginger which came in huge chunks: hence less candied and more ginger!) Used only 3/4 c sugar in the dough but otherwise followed the recipe. Love the spice combination, love how quick and easy these are to make, love the texture, love these cookies, period. Used a 1-inch cookie scoop and got 40 cookies. Thank you so much for the recipe! ETA: served these to a friend of mine, who (after one cookie) said ""I'm speechless"". After the second one she proclaimed these cookies to be perfect, and had a third one (and then a fourth). We are officially wowed by the perfection that is this cookie recipe! Thanks again!!"
570804,339530,2009-07-14,4,Bom Dia Mia #3:   Loved a recipe calling for white Port (very seldom find one).   Flavor is wonderful but after removing the chicken from the sauce I boil the sauce down a little to thicken. This also gives it a deeper flavor. Thanks again for a great recipe and so easy.
895056,40208,2009-10-16,5,"I've made this 3 times already!  Hubby requests it again ASAP.  I made it in the crock pot, 4-5 hours on high or 6-8 hours on low.  We added extra carrots, subbed spicy BBQ sauce for the steak sauce, and subbed turkey broth and a fall harvest beer for the water/bouillon cubes.  You'll want biscuits or hearty bread to soak up all the yumminess on the plate!"
320870,101104,2009-11-22,4,"My 1st attempt at Pumpkin Pie & it was pretty good.  DH ate most of it himself!  I added an extra dash of cloves because I love that flavor, which I will not do next time, was a little too overpowering.  I made Martha Stewart's recipe for Pate Brise Crust.  All in all it was a good result for a first try, will make again.  Thanks for posting!"
2001329932,362699,2017-01-28,3,"A flaming hot edition of the &quot;sisig&quot; is also available, using chili peppers, the hot sauce, and jalape&ntilde;o, when cooked."
1957485,168047,2011-11-23,4,It's a keeper! The only substitution I made was I used Target brand mini chocolate chips. The cookies have been sitting out for over 2 hours uncovered and it's still soft and chewy. There's a burst of chocolate chip in every bite. Very moist in the middle. Goes perfect with vanilla bean ice cream as well.
2002005623,217290,2018-02-22,5,Delious
254950,119014,2006-05-09,5,Tastes just like chocolate pudding!  I used splenda and added a little Torani Sugar-free vanilla syrup instead of vanilla.  A great dessert for those on a low calorie diet.  
2929523,99169,2014-03-24,4,My family really liked it.  I used legs and thighs and it was very good. Nor-man
424680,179035,2011-07-10,5,"Followed your recipe right on down & used frozen berries (Still haven't found great looking fresh blueberries anywhere around these past 2 weeks!) & the muffins were very nice ~ Easy to make & great on the taste buds (& the waist, for that matter!) Thanks for sharing this great keeper! [Made & reviewed as a THANK YOU for playing with us in Please Review My Recipe during the recent tour]"
271059,367202,2012-02-10,5,So easy and quick.  Have taken it to parties and it is a big hit.  Thanks
513039,136292,2008-10-30,5,"I needed a quick recipe for some plain spaghetti sauce for some company that came over ( I thought they did not like italian sausage in it) I knew to go to one of Kittencal's recipes. Everyone chose this marinara sauce over the one with italian sausage. My husband even came up to me later without being prompted and told me ""That sauce really was good!"" that means this is a winner! My kids loved it too. So simple, I threw it all together and then left it for about 1 hour or less and we loved it!! Thanks again for another great recipe! Oh and I used some frozen tomatoes from my garden instead of canned. I also did not have chili pepper flakes so used chili powder instead."
542159,382837,2009-09-10,5,Mmm. This remained me of the Mexican chocolate my former mother in law used to make. Only had a bar of 100% unsweetened dark coco so added 2 tablespoons of  Splenda as DH likes his sweet. There were smiles all-around. Thanks for the post.
57788,14211,2002-11-29,5,"This was a great recipe!  The fruit salsa was easy to make, and quite good.  This was a hit at my Thanksgiving dinner."
2955509,109872,2013-08-22,5,"DELISH!  I made this in hopes that my picky eater of a roommate would like it...He said, &quot;it&#039;s the best tuna salad I&#039;ve eaten&quot;...then he went for seconds!  Bravo.  Totally saving this recipe and making it in the future."
1489069,105548,2013-08-23,0,"I didn&#039;t rate because I didn&#039;t follow the recipe. I substituted butter for the Crisco and the cookies turned out like a softer version of a Danish butter cookie (like the ones you get in a tin at Christmas). They tasted good, but were not what I was expecting or wanting. After a quick Internet search it seems like this is what should be expected if using butter in place of Crisco, so I thought I&#039;d post this for others as baking ignorant as me. Made this way, the seem more like a cookie suitable for icing."
42340,96096,2004-09-22,5,"this is a fantastic frosting feels like whipped cream and tastes heavonly. the reciepe justs says sugar so I used granulated, and after about 15 min of whipping and the additon of the flour it did completely disapear, love it love it."
356127,84434,2006-10-14,5,"Sorry I forgot to post this when I made it,yummy
yummy
yummy
yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmy !"
10959277,33555,2015-02-11,3,"I&#039;m from Philipsburg, PA and this is a similar recipe my mom uses. My Grandmother was Pennsylvania Dutch (a German derivation, I think?). To our ham broth, we add a chopped onion, celery seed, lots of garlic powder and onion powder, dried parsley, black pepper, cubed potatoes, and green beans and half a cup of cubed carrots. Then it&#039;s simmered for about 1 hour. Mom uses some of the hot ham broth to moisten the dough instead of milk. For my version, I also add 3 tbs. chicken demi-glace (More Than Gourmet brand) to the water, to make the broth even more flavorful. Every generation in my family makes &quot;Popeye&quot; ( as we call it) this way. All the grandchildren start helping Mom make this when they are around 4-5. She gives them some dough to play with while she&#039;s cooking."
239767,237314,2013-03-25,5,"Just finished these for the first time and must say thank you for posting. Followed the recipe pretty close, just added more turkey (1 lb). The hubs commented several times on how tasty dinner was."
491095,78772,2009-08-18,5,I made this for Ethnic Bites here at work and we loved it.
141293,163259,2006-04-15,5,The dates make this special.  They are sweet and add almost a caramely flavor to the shake.  Nice change from berry and chocolate shakes.
62103,186029,2008-02-24,5,I made this seasoning to go with Kittencal's Red Beans and Rice with Sausage recipe # 152222.  It  makes a lot but I will use it as a rub for ribs.  Try it in the recipe I mentioned above.  You won't be disappointed!
251917,272781,2008-04-04,5,Spring PAC 2008: I made these to test out for a bake sale I am in charge of next week - these were easy to make and tasty too!! I will make these again for the bake sale!
2000999772,349082,2016-05-04,5,This was soooooo good! I added a 1/4th cup of lite mayo to the mixture and when the burgers were done I topped it with stir fried artichoke hearts and I put the provolone on the top and bottom of the burger bun because I had slices. My husband said it was better than going to a restaurant.
1577274,141212,2010-03-17,5,"Wonderful!  I was looking for a simple dinner recipe and this was it.  I didn't have green beans so I used sliced celery, and I used leftover stuffing instead of stuffing mix (minus the water).  I also kept the chicken whole.  Perfect, easy."
359220,115258,2007-10-09,5,"Five stars all the way!  Very simple, very low in fat and perfect for a cool evening.  I followed the directions to a ""T"" except in I used land'o'lakes half fat butter (margarine) and fat free half and half.  Superb results...I do recommend cooking the cream mixture over medium high heat to get a good simmer and really thicken it up.  So delish!  I can't wait to make again and again!"
486078,307556,2010-02-03,5,"Wow! Great salsa/salad.  Served as a side with grilled spicey chicken.  Simple, healthy and very refreshing.  We really enjoyed this. Thx. for posting!"
2002005281,85364,2018-02-22,0,Used almond milk and almond flour for a paleo version &amp; it turned out great!
385999,29253,2008-04-21,5,I love this recipe.  It was so darn easy.  I used my breadman bread machine.  I used one pan for both loaves and spritzed them with water every 5 minutes.  I plan to make this again.  Thanks for the simple recipe Trish! :)
371126,32731,2009-09-12,5,"This is basically how I do my baked spaghetti. Depending on the sauce you use, this may need some seasoning up, but it's good. I also prefer to use mozzarella with spaghetti dishes!"
163112,160873,2007-08-08,5,"Absolute comfort food.  This really, really hit the spot today!!!  Next time I need to make a double batch.  I wish I could give you more stars for this, Potsie! This means I'm white trash, too - right??   *smooch*"
65414,13499,2004-09-07,5,"Very good recipe, easy to make and the whole family liked it.  Would definitely make it again."
1619358,199504,2010-05-21,5,Excellent marinade! Everyone at our party raved about it!!!!
41578,363600,2010-02-09,5,"What a fun and delicious recipe.  I purposely invited the neighbors over so I could try this out and they loved it!  I did, however, eliminate the jalapenos as we are not big on too spicy.  I do believe that the next time, I will add just a little bit of the jalapenos for a slight kick.  Very good recipe, CadillacGirl, and thanks so much for sharing it.  Can wait to make them again."
485151,225455,2010-06-01,4,"This was our first time eating churros, so I have no comparison. The kids loved them. Hubby & I thought they were good. I'll probably make them again sometime when we're having a mexican-style dinner. I didn't pay attention to how many it serves, next time I'll only make a half batch!"
119708,84612,2007-04-18,5,"When I saw all of the ratings on this recipe, I had to try it...
and OMG it is awesome!  I wasn't really wanting to make a Tiramisu because they are somewhat boring to me.  This recipe is different!
I made it for my niece's wedding shower and there wasn't a person there that didn't love it.  I will make it again...and again...and again...and......
Thanks Syrah!"
1400556,133718,2010-01-05,0,Very good. Quick and easy. I used lemon juice instead of zest.  I also added a little sage and oregano to the breadcrumbs.  Everyone loved it.  Served with Garlic baked potatoes and broccoli.
437965,8739,2007-02-05,5,"My daughter and I love gaucamole, so needless to say...i was excited to make it!! It was wonderful! I even had my neighbor(who loves guacamole)come rate it for me, and she gave it 12 stars! She said 5 wasnt enough! Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe. It will be made many times, for sure!!"
142048,33919,2004-10-21,5,"I'll add mine to the rest of the 63 reviews!!!!  This definitely was a hit in my house.  DH and DSD both said it was very good.  I used ground beef and added 1 can of diced tomatoes w/jalapenos, colby cheese and added olives on top.  It still could have been spicier for our tastes, though.  I served with salsa, tabasco, diced tomatoes, chopped onions and sour cream.  Just had a small serving left for my lunch today!"
262272,89575,2008-09-13,5,"I made this for PAC Fall 2008.  We got about 20 5 inch square waffles, give or take with overflow and not putting enough on the griddle.  My family was crazy for these.  The kids raved and DH said he couldn't imagine waffles tasting any better than these.  We only had two left over.  I guess we have a keeper:)"
106797,38259,2007-12-08,3,"Although I loved the final product, the way you wrote the recipe was very confusing.  You start in saying, "".. cheese sauce"", when there is no cheese sauce mentioned in the ingredients.  I had to read the recipe 3 times to assume that the ""cheese sauce"" meant ""alfredo sauce"".  It is not the same thing, hence the confusion."
316990,101954,2006-09-21,5,"I have now made this twice and each time the nuts have ""floated"" to the top and the sticky bit is in the middle.  I am not sure if this is how the pie should be as I have never made peacan pie before.  I also found that I had to leave in the oven for quite a bit longer.  With all this said, I will make it again.  Thanks"
2001053789,449452,2018-01-07,0,"&quot;This chicken recipe is killer,&quot; said husband. Flavor was fantastic, super crisp skin. Used rack &amp; convection oven, 1 hour only."
464080,458204,2011-06-30,5,"Great burgers!  I found this recipe in Cooking Light and I am so glad you already had it posted here on food.com; I made them last weekend!  I  decreased the thyme by half, as mine was pretty strong and I didn't want it to overpower the other flavors.  I also used sherry wine, as I couldn't find sherry vinegar at the store and that worked fabulously and I don't think I would use the vinegar (since the blue cheese mayo already had that tang to it).  Thanks for posting and wish I would have taken a picture of the beauties!"
32772,74067,2003-10-28,5,These have been a family favorite for sometime. I remember my grandmother making these as a small child. I still enjoy them today.
408915,114206,2007-04-01,4,"My husband said that it was okay, but my sister was it was awesome with much excitement.  I thought that it was very moist and tasty!  There was too much batter (almost too much for my big mixing bowl), so I also made 6 cupcakes.  I didn't have any all-spice, but I think it turned out well without it.  Next time I'll add some walnuts for texture.  I'll also add less oil (maybe 7/8 of a cup instead of the 1.25).  The frosting was very good, but was too sweet, so we'll add less sugar (or maybe substitute it with honey).  Thank you for sharing the great recipe!"
1397704,259573,2011-01-22,5,Worked well!  The first time I tried it I let the eggs sit in the ice water for too long (probably a couple hours) and they were not easy to peel but I did it per the instructions and I didn't have one shell stick! Thanks Kittencal! About to try your deviled egg recipe!  I was happy when I found it!  You recipes ALWAYS rock! ;)
1800121922,418134,2014-06-19,0,"I wasn&#039;t sure about this recipe...I&#039;ve never used the green enchilada sauce before and was not sure if I would like the low carb, low fat version...so wrong, these are very good for being low carb and low fat.  My family is not a fan of the cilantro, so that is the only thing I would cut back on for next time, otherwise they are creamy with the mixture of fat free cream cheese and the mozzarella mixed right in with the chicken and I did use a little more of the mozzarella for the top, but I would highly recommend if you are looking for a healthier version of this classic Mexican dish!"
1166993,113750,2010-11-10,5,"Great dressing. I've never had Dorothy Lynch dressing so I can't compare the flavors, but I'm sure this dressing stands on it's own. I love salads & salad dressings & I NEVER have bottled dressing in my fridge so this recipe hits the spot with all the ingredients already in the pantry. So glad to have a dressing recipe I can whip up when I want a dressing but dont feel like running out to the store for special ingredients! Thank you for posting."
85486,30013,2005-06-26,5,I was looking for something different to do with chicken on the grill. Didn't make any changes except to double the recipe. What a great flavor the cumin gave the chicken - the kids said they'd pick this over bbq sauce. Marinate at least 6 hours for best results. Sure to be a bbq favorite.
101823,313321,2009-01-04,5,"This is the perfect cookie for me.  I love their simplicity for preparation, but complexity of flavor.  They are the perfect balance of sweet white chocolate and tart lime.  My holiday cookie trays were great with this addition."
875234,154344,2008-06-28,5,"What a Superb recipe!
Its easy to make, tastes devine and looks wonderful!"
478964,59773,2008-12-23,5,VERY GOOD!  I love that it is creamy and EASY!!!  THANKS
198971,39331,2005-12-29,5,"Very tasty! I recommend tasting it after adding the prepared horseradish - the brand I used was very mild, so I ended up tripling the amount called for."
2000402178,99476,2015-08-14,5,"We, my family love this. I cook it a lot. I add 2 tbsps sugar, sometimes 3. I like it sweeter"
382071,304348,2008-07-16,5,"WONDERFUL! I made this in a 2 cup pyrex in the microwave. I used 2 cups of water and 2 black leaf tea bags. I sweetened it with Brown Sugar Splenda. When it was done steeping, I strained it into a large mug and stirred in some dry creamer and light cream in lieu of milk. This has a very mild flavor with undertones of cocoa and spice. LOVELY! Made for the Beverage tag game."
234912,168990,2006-06-22,5,"I can't state exactly how great this recipe is.  My 17 year old son has complimented me in the past, but upon making this he stated that ""No one does chicken like I do"". The only change I made was I only use boneless, skinless breasts.  This will definetly be served again and again."
1242182,424871,2010-06-18,5,OMG I was just coming on to enter this recipe- thanks for already doing it!!!  We made this for an appetizer at our last dinner party and it was devoured!!!  I even found sesame crackers at the 99cent store :)
1939768,114709,2011-06-25,5,Delicious and easy.  I would agree that less salt would make this recipe tastier.  I think I'll cut it by at least half next time.
54048,29749,2002-11-05,5,This is a recipe I'll make many times over.  So good and filling and a great way to ue up chili!!  This is a wonderful find.
231054,290002,2009-04-06,5,"I was just getting ready to post this recpe -- found it in a newspaper a couple weeks ago and just made them this past weekend.  WOW!!!  The outside is a nice semi-crisp cookie -- but the center is this marvelous creamy filling that is devine!!!  I know the next time I make them, I will be doubling the recipe.  The only way anyone would be disappointed in these is if you don't like peanut butter or peanuts!!!"
219318,198003,2007-11-13,4,"These were quite tasty and very easy to make.  I really liked the vinegar flavor.  The beans ended up getting a bit overcooked for my taste, but I like my veggies on the crisp side.  Dh thought they were great as is.  Next time I will shorten the first stage of cooking (poor dh)."
31883,17625,2002-06-10,5,Good dip!!!
355621,108925,2008-02-25,5,pretty yummy...
885416,82925,2008-09-18,5,"Great flavor!  In accidentally mismeasured and only put in about a 1/4 cup of butter, but it still tasted great - and I cut the calories! Will make again."
27416,29679,2002-07-25,5,"Karen;
Your ""REESE'S Sqares"" are not only delicious, but a great BIG WOW!
I have now made them 5 times and everyone asks for the recipe.  So easy to make, and OH-SO-GOOD.
Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.
""Uncle Bill"""
133174,378981,2009-09-03,5,I used fresh garden okra and in place of the salt and pepper used a teaspoon of Cajun Seasoning.  The finished dish reminded me very much of the okra from my childhood.
870840,4950,2009-03-22,4,"Well first I learned my small town does not sell liquor at all, and even the nearest city by law cannot sell it on Sunday which is today (see Rev ch 13-study your Bible and obey the Ten Commandments! Not man's revisions of the law :) ). Anyway, so I had to skip the Curacao (I know, hopefully someone will review who actually used this different ingredient). I boiled potatoes instead of bake & didn't care for the crumb topping as the directions weren't the clearest. Came out mushy.  Overall tasted fine but I've had better the more traditional way. The pineapple taste was subtle so this was good and I may use this ingred again.  Blessings in Jesus."
817413,141442,2008-12-08,4,"These are delicious!  I  made them with semi sweet chips and then dipped them in dark chocolate and ground pecans.  Yum yum!  A real winner, super easy and very versatile.  I'll be using this again!"
2001530071,107684,2017-09-26,0,"When going to college, had 2 young boys, so made extra for the freezer. Really came in handy when studying for midterms! Camzmom, as often as you make these, may work for you. Thank you Tired Grandma for the tip about sauteing the onions, like you I hate any crunch in the onions! That's the reason I quit buying most of the Ragus, they began using crunchy onions that refuse to get any softer when simmering the sauce. Another quick way I learned while in college to cook meatballs was to place them in round baking dishes, cover w/waxed paper &amp; place in micro for 5-10 minutes. Half way through pulled balls outside circle to the inside for even cooking. Used slotted spoon to remove leaving any fat behind. Going to make this great recipe soon. Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
214855,18200,2005-07-30,5,I have been making this recipe for a while. My family loves it. I omit the cheese as my children dont eat it. I also make the dough at night and leave it covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator and cook it for lunch the next day. We often serve it with soup and/or semi-dried tomatoes for snacks. Really very good.
209255,218240,2007-11-06,4,"I really enjoyed this.  That said, it looks kind of funny once you add the dressing.  It kind of turns a purple colour.  Who couldn't use a little more purple food in their diet though?!?!  I omitted the nuts to lower the fat content.  Didn't miss them at all!  This is great for a quick lunch or two.  I will make this again."
57042,189586,2008-04-18,4,I gave this 4 stars. This cake and icing was so good. My family really enjoyed this cake. We think the spice flavor was a perfect blend. I followed the recipe just as described. I will make this again for sure. Thanks so much for posting a great recipe! Christine (internetnut)
59064,37613,2003-02-05,5,"I'm upgrading this review as it is one of the first things I thought of when I felt like making a dip. If its memorable then it becomes a 5 star...
This is a very easy dip to make and has a very good taste. It is quite thick. I used lime juice as I didn't have any lemons. It would especially good accompanying highly spiced foods that perhaps contain a little chilli. Definitely worth making again and very handy when you need a few more dips for a party.
"
6258,73915,2003-11-05,5,"A five star recipe for sure! :-)
I used some mesquite smoked turkey that was in my freezer, used everything the recipe called for except that I didn't have cashews, so I used dry roasted peanuts.  The dressing is what makes the salad.  Just the right amount of (hot)mango chutney and curry powder makes the dressing fragrant and robust.  I served the salad over some romaine lettuce for an elegant entreÃ©.  Thank you so much for sharing this delightful salad recipe."
166642,73970,2009-05-03,5,"The chops are very tender and the sauce is delicious. Since sauce in a crock pot is often very thin, it's great to put the pork chops on the plate and cut up a little and pour the sauce over the pork chops. This way, the sauce is throughout the chops and gives them wonderful flavor. I served it over rice as suggested. Loves the sweetness from the brown sugar, but I did not think these are spicy! Thanks for sharing."
1006203,136577,2009-08-22,5,I love these carrots and so does my family.  I simmer these carrots on low for a while before serving so they really get soft and flavorful!
142512,289997,2011-07-30,5,I have already made this recipe twice.  It is so fast and easy make sure to have your sides almost done because this cooks really fast.
315301,40046,2008-01-23,5,Great taste and oh so easy to make. This one's a keeper!! 5 stars for you Shelli!!
695933,298939,2013-12-11,5,"This recipe was so easy and quick, The only difference is that they suggest a deep dish pie pan (the filling amount is actually for a deep dish pan) and increasing the baking time to 55 to 60 minutes and cooling for 2 hours before cutting. Otherwise, it is an exact replica. Dark and light corn syrups are interchangeable....the recipe is the same on both bottles, just be sure to watch it in the oven so the top doesn&#039;t over brown! Cover with foil if it starts to.*Tip: Cover edge of pie crust with aluminun foil for first 25 minutes of bake time, then remove for remaining 20 minutes, to prevent the crust from burning. Thank You! The 2nd. one I used a Gramn Cracker or a Pecan crust. I Will be making this recipe again. You got me Inspired to do a new recipe. I think I may do a Pecan Pumpkin Pie to play with for the Holiday. PRMR 2013 Happy Cooking to y&#039;all!..Thank You!..Grpa  Glad you posted the recipe."
316460,38041,2008-06-01,5,"These were very good.  I grew up on the recipe on the back of the toll house chips bag; now I don't have those in my local grocery store.  I reduced the sugars and butter somewhat, substituting applesauce instead.  Like everyone else said, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, a bit hit with everyone."
1221150,289804,2009-07-03,5,"A delicate, colorful sauce which would also be great with scallops, shrimp or fish. Thank you."
1007310,321074,2008-10-29,0,This did not rise for me.  The directions were also difficult to follow...since I am new to baking breads.  Where was the 4 Tablespoons of sugar used?...it's not in the directions.  Thanks...I bet they would taste great though!
1056692,200194,2016-10-10,4,"I cheated and used frozen squash and I thought it was really good. I liked the mix of spices, and I hate super sweetened squash or sweet potatoes. If I want dessert, I'll have it AFTER dinner! I cut back on the spices because I had less squash, and roasted on parchment to avoid sticking. My husband, however, did not care for the spice mix, so we probably won't make this again without a backup dish. Thanks for sharing."
20754,29679,2002-08-30,5,"I would give this recipe a 10 star if I could!  Love the peanut butter and chocolate combo!  Tastes like Reeses Peanut butter cups MMMMMMMMMMMM   I put these in the freezer and ate them frozen, tastes wonderful, just like a frozen Snickers or Butterfinger.  Really liked these frozen ; ) Thanks Karen they are a keeper in this house."
204024,413114,2010-04-18,5,Simple and successful.  We made three pizzas from this: two fairly normal hand-tossed pizzas and a Chicago-style deep dish one.  All three came out great!  I kneaded the dough-ball quite a while and was surprised that isn't in the directions; but one effect of kneading is that the dough must sit a while before being rolled out or it will pull back into a ball as you spread it.  Made for Pick A Chef.
128646,14359,2007-09-07,5,This was really an incredible stuffing.  And the sausage/celery/onion smell mixing with all the other smells in the kitchen -- it was just fantastic.  I made this with a turkey sausage (recipe #142364) and it was delicious.
2000362937,290922,2015-07-26,5,Delicious!!  Wonderful flavors!  I followed the recipe except I added 1/2 tsp of chili flakes instead of a full tsp.  Added Carrots and onions and it was a hit!   Will make it again!
2547613,297780,2012-12-07,5,"I needed a quick and easy, yet colorful and delicious salad for dinner party and found this one.  Despite not normally trying out new recipes on guests, it seemed foolproof and it was.  It is very tasty and makes a pretty presentation.  I am going to make it for Christmas Eve dinner and know everyone will it enjoy it as much as I did.  I followed recipe ingredients exactly as written and used the most delicious dressing, from Cindy's Kitchen (sold in NC at Fresh Market) Barcelona Vinaigrette-Mediterranean Style which is sugar and gluten free!  This dressing is great on many different salads and it really set off the flavors in this one."
128473,268894,2009-05-24,5,"This was a lovely thick soup. It was rich, deep and very flavorful. We loved it.  So quick and easy to put together. I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks so much for sharing Jewelies."
1625946,178146,2010-06-01,5,I LOVE this recipe. I make it all the time and my friends can't get enough of it
377070,226218,2007-06-03,5,"This was exceptionally good. We like things a bit spicier so added 1 tsp Sambal Oelek (hot chili paste). An excellent meal for special company.
**Edit - I've been reading through the other comments about how Paella is supposed to hard to make.  I was totally unaware of this when I made it.  It wasn't hard to do at all and totally worth doing again (in effort and cost even when you live in Northern Canada)"
51224,31745,2007-09-25,5,"Thank you for posting this different and very tasty salad.  I made it about 8 hours before serving and used gorganzola instead of feta cheese.  Since I'm not a big fan of balsamic vinegar, I cut 1/2 cup down to probably 1/4 cup.  Used cherry tomatoes and fresh basil from the garden.  It makes a beautiful salad which I will definitely make again since we love asparagus."
35848,23496,2002-04-10,5,"Been looking for this recipe forever - I remember this candy from my childhood. Thank you so much MEANCHEF for sharing it. Its some work, but sooo worth it! You can't believe that these three simple ingredients can make something this creamy and sweet. You really need to try this - you've never tasted anything quite like it."
679445,28148,2008-07-23,5,"these were so yummy. The first time I made them just as the recipe said, and then the second time I softened each tortilla in oil before putting in the chicken mixture and baking. doing so made the chimichangas actually taste more like they would at a restaurant...although adding extra calories (which I thought was well worth it!) thanks for a great recipe."
120161,82945,2008-10-30,5,LOVE THESE SUGAR COOKIES!!  I have always purchased sugar cookie dough b/c I usually want to make it and use it when the urge strikes.  Since most recipes call for 30 min chilling time I just use the stuff that's already to go.  NOT ANYMORE!!  I used almond extract instead of vanilla and it was PERFECT!!  Thanks for the recipe!!
590105,242881,2008-08-26,5,"Yummy!  (I think I'll go have another bowl!)  I used 1 tsp dried herbs for each of those, left out the sugar and wine, and used water instead of the stock.  Very delicious!  Thank you!  Reviewed for Healthy Choices ABC tag."
123871,109181,2005-12-08,5,"This was very good. I used tater-tots, Italian tomatoes, and cream of mushroom soup. I put on some ketchup when serving. We loved it!"
1546669,20870,2010-02-08,3,"Great recipe! If you put the batter in the fridge for 30-45 minutes and bake it straight out of the fridge, they'll crisp up and be less soft!"
356062,201386,2008-02-01,5,This was a ten star dish for me! I did cut back on the amount of butter and oilve oil used and actually used margarine instead. Also I used reduced sodium chicken stock. The sauce was devine! The lemon added just the right amount of tartness to make a super sauce. Great recipe!
326051,37638,2007-04-11,4,Very good recipe.  I add 1 cup of medium salsa to this as well for some extra flavor and spice.  I like lots of spice so went up to a tablespoon of chili powder as well.
567310,115110,2007-11-15,4,"I used a whole wheat pie shell instead of tortillas, added kale to the spinach,and went without the bacon. Tasted great"
531514,264083,2007-12-08,4,"I agree...it must be a Texas thing. This recipe is very, very similar to my Mam-Maw's Chicken & Dressing recipe. I supersized this recipe to feed 60. I made my cornbread from scratch (cheaper and easier) and toasted my bread before cubing. The only other change was that instead of straight sage, I used poultry seasoning. This helps to keep the dressing from turning greenish. (Again, what my Mam-Maw did). 

Thanks for putting this recipe on 'zaar - it is a hard one to explain. LOOSE is correct - You want the dressing to have a jiggle to it. Plus, be sure to only use a 9x13 pan, anything deeper takes too long to cook and the top begins to get too brown. 

Also, this recipes FREEZES wonderfully. My Mam-Maw did this all the time, and sure enough I tried it with Moi's recipe and it works, too. To use it after freezing, let it thaw in the fridge, and then bake as directed."
37449,108019,2010-01-15,5,I very much enjoyed this coffee! A nice way to wake up. I used decaf coffee and almond milk. Yum! Thanks! Made for the Snow Queens round of the Comfort Cafe-Recipe of the Day.
752725,350689,2011-05-09,5,This was delicious!!  I have now made it 4 times in the last 2 months!! My hubby begs for it!!
82616,146868,2006-01-20,5,"This is my other recipe I am late reviewing sorry. This drink is so nummy, we made this one evening and put a log on the fire and watched It's a wonderful Life !!
Thanks Toni"
36944,234523,2007-07-09,5,This cake was easy to make and the taste is full of different flavors - chocolate and spicy and not too sweet! It has a nice firm texture and the applesauce makes it very moist.    I think it will be perfect with a scoop of ice cream.  This is a delicious cake and thank you for posting your family recipe gertc96!
51579,66023,2003-07-09,5,"My 7-yr old's comments while we were eating this were, ""Mom, you should make this more often!""  Plus, she and my husband had seconds!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, only I used frozen corn kernels I thawed under running water.  Since I didn't have salsa con queso, I took a jar of regular salsa and added some grated sharp cheddar cheese and spooned that on top of the casserole and baked for about 50 minutes.  YUM!  A very nice casserole with a Mexican twist!  Thanks, Mary!!"
57222,217583,2007-04-14,5,"Mmm, very rich and decadent! Great for coconut lovers. I made 1/4 recipe and rolled the dough into about one inch balls - got 25 so I would up the recipe yield to about a hundred little morsels of yum! Used half margarine and half butter, well softened. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
428885,254026,2008-07-02,5,"Well this is a wonderful treat, even though it is summer. Sometimes the family just needs some mac/n/cheese and this is great. I followed this exactly, although I do admit to melting half of the cheese right into the sauce, and then layered the rest. I halved this recipe and it was more then enough to feed our family gathered so patiently around the table. I added some sharp cheese to the top on the last 5 minutes the casserole was creamy with a bit of cheese on the top. Fantastic iewe! Made for ""ZWT4"" June 2008."
250719,156444,2008-11-12,5,My son and I made these and thought they were very good.
482933,446471,2011-10-31,5,"DH and I love food like this!  Crisp, tasty, and not oily.  Had this with meatloaf, recipe#302906, and for dessert recipe#390000.  Thanks nemokitty for sharing."
936601,178169,2009-10-31,5,"Well now this is a wonderful and quick recipe!  I love that I can whip this together in minutes, and have a delicious hot and flavorful bread to serve with soup or stews!  In fact this was served with CoffeeB's Beef Stew for dinner!  Loved it!  Thank you Char!  I will be using this often!  Made for KK Mini Cookathon!"
93186,86623,2008-09-02,5,"This is the best lasagna I have ever made!  We're talking slap yo mamma good!  I too couldn't find the ground pork, but not daunted... I cooked ground beef in pork broth... yumm.  Thanks!"
52648,108926,2009-02-27,4,"I made the recipe just as it's written, with the lower amount of sugar, and loved it.  So did my husband.  What a nice, different, not everyday way to use squash.  And it was super easy.  The ony reason I didn't give 5 stars is because my chidren didn't care for it."
424680,200468,2007-02-05,5,"I'm fairly new to crock pot cooking, but enjoy doing pork roasts, so this recipe was made for me! And since I'm a big fan of cranberries & apricots, well.... Except for the fact that a half cup of quartered dried apricots was added, the recipe was followed exactly, & the resulting roast was very tender & oh so tasty! Several guests even had me make copies of the recipe for them to take home! Many thanks for sharing this OUTSTANDING recipe!"
209983,139601,2006-10-09,5,"This was a good soup.  I doubled the recipe but didn't brown the meat in butter, I also used low sodium broth and added some mushrooms.  Next time I may decrease the seasoning as this was a bit to peppery flavored for any of our liking however I want to make it again with other seasonings. Thanks for posting!!!!!"
1289403,373658,2009-06-27,4,"yummy, they come out nice and moist, i did add extra spice, i didn't measure but i am pretty sure i doubled the spice amounts  :)"
570804,53198,2013-06-04,5,We are salmon lovers but usually only on the grill with limited amount of seasoning.  This is not the norm for us but it is for a very special treat and loved it.  This topping also works with haddock or cod........so versatile.    We do like the cheddar on top.....
122235,102176,2005-01-29,4,"This was a nice change of pace from the usual oatmeal.  I don't like very sweet cereal, so I used only the brown sugar.  I found that for my taste the pumpkin pie spice overwhelmed the pumpkin to some extent, so next time I will probably go to 1/3 of a cup of pumpkin & cut back a bit on the spice."
238258,187684,2010-09-23,0,Very nice fish recipe. I made bechamele slightly thicker so it would look better on the plate. Thanks for posting.
227978,510766,2014-08-22,5,"Excellent bread!  It was not only quite flavorful, but it was moist and the outer crust was just perfect (toasted without being crumbly).  I&#039;d recommend this bread recipe to anyone who likes fresh baked bread.  It&#039;s delicious.  Thanks, KateL.  Made for 2014 Culinary Quest (South America)."
369715,203987,2008-08-14,5,"I made this for my sons band as they practice at our house every week. For the most part, I followed the recipe but didn't follow the directions as written. I used two pounds of hamburger. I cooked the burger, onions, peppers and garlic all at one time as my onions and peppers were frozen. I then added the taco sauce, one cup of beef broth instead of water and a cup of sour cream. I missed the taco seasoning in the directions earlier so I added it now. I cooked the mixture a few minutes and  then added two cups of cheddar cheese. I didn't add any of the optional ingredients. I thought this was tasty but the boys thought it was really good. This was very easy to make with ingredients I normally have on hand."
90670,22782,2003-12-18,5,"Delicious! I made this the night before, and threw it in the frig till morning.  Put it going in the crockpot at 7 a.m ate at 5-ish that night, it was DELICIOUS!  The smell in the house all day was SPECTACULAR! I followed the recipe right as it says (even with 2c. water) This is a definate keeper for us!  Thanks soooo much for posting!"
695933,436591,2012-11-13,4,"I was really impressed at how these simple ingredients came together to form such a wonderful delicious meal. The house smelled so good while it was cooking, too! I served mine with shredded cheese and sour cream on top, but it was awesome on it's own as well! Thank You!<br/>Grpa P.A C. 2012"
157425,191430,2009-05-27,4,"I love Paula Deen but sorry to say this meatloaf wasnt a winner for me. DH really enjoyed it, especially the sauce. I used ground chuck but I think ground round would be nicer to limit the amount of grease. Made and reviewed for the Iron Chef Secret Ingredient tag game."
350108,145115,2009-01-30,4,"After making these tonight, I will definitely make them again, but with a couple changes.  I really think the butter needs to be cut in half.  My batch was very greasy, yummy but greasy.  I also added cinnamon to mine, and it is very important to salt them well.  Very good recipe."
88099,136962,2011-10-11,4,This was very nice for a quick week night meal.  I altered the amount of chicken and rice to get to the consistency I wanted.  I had to use cheddar cheese as I didn't have American.  The seasoning was very good.  May play around with this one with some saute mushrooms and maybe onion added.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for PAC Fall 2011
125458,116807,2006-08-07,4,I ordinarily don't care for cottage cheese but i was short on protein today so whipped this up using fatfree cheese. This was quite flavorful and terribly easy to make.
2043441,83611,2015-10-15,5,I put the spinach and artichoke dip in a casserole bowl and added more cheese on the top covered it in aluminum foil and bake it on 350 until it was hot and bubbly. This is the best spinach artichoke dip recipe out there! My whole family absolutely loves it.
687641,268076,2008-01-25,5,This is awesome! My neighbor used a pork loin and had the same awesome results! Thank you for sharing this recipe!
325147,258269,2013-01-18,5,This one's a keeper.  This was really good and easy to make.  I halved the recipe and it was perfect!  Thanks for posting.
2574795,294620,2017-08-12,5,"Good basic recipe that you can play with for your tastes. I cut sugar to two tablespoons. Added a little finely chopped onion, celery seeds, and teaspoon prepared mustard. Gets better on day two."
184723,179966,2008-06-30,5,"This was the best!!!!  I roasted the asparagus in the oven before adding it with the noodles because we prefer it softer.  Also, I split into two portions before adding the chile sauce to please my 1, 3 and 9 year olds.  EVERYONE gobbled this up.  My husband finished up every last bit even scraping off the kids plates and added some extra hot chile sauce to his.  Besides being easy... this was a very impressive dish I would serve to guests.  I am going to try this next time with pork and broccoli.  So versatile this recipe is!  Thanks for posting!"
8526,15072,2002-11-14,5,"UNBELIEVABLE!!! I swear, cross my heart, I will NEVER buy a boxed mix again! I didn't even have the vanilla to add and these came out perfect. They filled up the pan nice and deep like no boxed mix can. I COULD NOT wait for them to cool, so I cut them warm and they popped out easily. Everyone is raving about them. Thank you!"
71653,22941,2005-01-18,5,"Woo Hoo, this was good! Plenty spicy and a nice light sauce. I added a little more garlic and some grilled chicken breast. I also used diced tomatoes since that's what I had. Definitely adding this to my meal rotation. Thanks for posting!"
107135,372322,2013-07-23,5,a yield of .75 still makes a very generous  amount nice salad dressing.zwt9
329769,263512,2008-07-05,4,"*Reviewed during ZWT4* These were quick and easy and used ingredients that I normally have on hand. I used smoked paprika sprinkled on my chips with the parmesan and salt. Great for eating with guacomole.  I also made your recipe#287183 for a terrific combo.

694852,1005,2009-04-16,5,"This is by far the best pizza dough recipe I have ever used, and I have used many over the years!  It is easy, tastes fantastic and has a wonderful texture.  

I usually make a deep dish pizza. I just take two 9"" cake pans (disposable works best) and spray them liberally with olive oil cooking spray, and let the dough rise in the oil.  Then pat it out if you need to, top, and bake as this recipe directs.  It never fails! :D"
261471,201490,2009-01-11,4,"Very simple, vey good! Prep was only about 5 minutes. I added a dried spice blend of sea salt, garlic, basil and oregano instead of salt and pepper which enhanced the flavor."
500860,151491,2007-08-07,4,"A meal to impress!!!

But only after you get the hang of it.

1. DO NOT OVER DO THE CRUST. I put too thick a crust and this just DID NOT WORK.

2.Make sure your oil is VERY VERY VERY VERY hot before putting the fish in the pan. If it's not hot enough the potato won't brown and will fall apart in an oily mess.

3. If there is left over potato, it's worth adding an egg and some flour and making some latkes (potato pancakes). Fry them up same as the fish...just without the fish.

4. When the fish shrinks up (YOU WILL NOTICE IT!!!) it's done.

I added a full sprig of rosemary and two potatos. Since I LOVE rosemary this packed a delicious punch. Really beautiful to look at. Like a big potato pancake filled with fish. I used pollack.

It's about a 4.5 star recipe!"
1955615,208807,2011-07-12,5,"I was hesitant to make this, but I had the ingredients and added more leftovers.  It was awesome.  I had taco meat, unseasoned and browned ground beef, a jar or homemade salsa, ranch style beans to name a few.  I also used white long grain rice.  It was delicious and made a ton.  Lots of leftovers. Didn't add some of the raw vegetables as I had a lot already cooked in the added ingredients."
141293,97115,2005-01-25,5,"Very Good, light and fluffy. I used vanilla yogurt and served them with my Banana Walnut Syrup #109327, topped with French Vanilla cool whip."
149320,78799,2004-12-28,5,"Great recipe, We will bring in the New Year with this one!
I too save chicken fat from leg quarters in the freezer, along with the rendered chicken fat from oven roasted chicken. It comes in handy for lots of flavor added cooking! "
60992,64112,2004-01-03,5,"These are just too good for words! We are trying to stay away from beef and this is an excellent choice! I doubled the recipe and served them over rice pilaf with a tzatziki style cucmber salad on the side. the meatballs were tender and flavorful and the sauce is just beyond description...tomatoey,creamy,spicey yet mellow, very comforting. I will be serving this often. Thanks Kelly for creating this scrumptious recipe!"
314785,62405,2009-11-03,5,"This is about the same as 'my' recipe for See's fudge.  It's very good.  I just use a 12 oz can of evap milk and have no problems.  I do stir constantly during the 7-8 min rolling boil -- try to keep your temperature as low as possible while maintaining a boil.  Use the largest jelly roll pan you can find (mine is 11.5"" x 17"") as this makes a ton.  Fudge didn't step for you?? Turn them into truffles by making balls & roll in cocoa or something -- and next time boil a little longer."
112106,103847,2005-08-26,5,"I'm a diabetic and i cooked this cake for a Church dinner and it was all eaten.  Outstanding flavor and moist as well i had to amke copies of the recipe for other people.

Thanks  Roger"
442070,288061,2009-05-04,5,"Superb! Wonderful for my Greek theme, easy and delish!  Company raved ( I blushed because it was so easy).. I was able  to use my garden herbs and fresh garlic, I think fresh really adds so much. Served it with garlic stuffed olives, I made pita chips and tsatsiki, greek salad, grilled greek potatoes, I am really glad I found your recipe! thank you so much for posting it. I am totally making this again.  Marmie"
312208,187815,2010-11-07,5,Whole family loved this simple glaze for sweet potatoes.  Smelled wonderful while roasting and did not disappoint once on the table either.  Thank you for sharing!
1150951,131018,2009-08-04,5,"Best pulled pork I have ever had! My whole family also agreed it was amazing.

Recipe was VERY easy (except tearing the pork appart was rather tedious).

Followed the recipe pretty much exact. I added some liquid smoke in with the BBQ sauce, and my shoulder roast was 5 pounds.

A few tips...

1. I would recommend flipping the roast over with a few hours remaining in the 12 hour cook. My road was larger than the recipe asks for, but after 12 hours the bottom half was cooked perfectly amd the top was not quite there yet, and there was some blood when I cut it open. I flipped it over and cooked another hour or so on low and then it was perfect.

If you are in Canada you can get Sweet Baby Ray's at Sobeys - but beware that the bottle is smaller in Canada than the 18 once one recomended by the author. I had to run out and buy another bottle as it didn't look like enough sauce. I used 1 full bottle and another half bottle and that seemed perfect for a 5 pounder. I only cooked it on low for about 2 hours after adding the sauce.

I will definitely make this again!!"
653438,55496,2011-04-06,5,Quite a tasty salad!  I used crasins and cut the recipe in half but other wise followed it.  Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag.
1535,175888,2007-06-29,5,"What fun!!! My kids thought this was great. Unfortunately, I only had regular 7-up. Since the sugar content was between the cranberry juice and Gatorade, I tried put the white layer in the middle. Apparently, the 7-Up sugar content was too close to the Gatorade's as they didn't stay separated very well. They still tasted great even without them looking quite right. I'll try it again sometime with the right ingredients. ;)"
1016189,328784,2011-10-14,4,"Totally delicious recipe, however it made a terrible mess in the microwave! I did halve the recipe, so I might not have put it in a big enough pan (7.5 inch round with 3 inch sides), but I didn't expect it to run over as much as it did. (My mom definately wasn't happy with the mess!)"
432917,179787,2007-12-16,5,Yummy!  I love this recipe!
58836,89207,2010-02-14,5,Made this last week to frost recipe 11799 and it was delicious.  Took to board meeting and leftovers were put in lounge next day.  I had lots of requests for the recipe.  I'm sure I will make this one again...Thankd Kitten!
441498,202110,2008-02-19,5,"Great cake, if you like lemon, you will definitely like this cake.  I have made it several times and each time get rave reviews.  It does take a little extra time but is so worth it.  I put it in my springform pan and garnished it with lemon zest.  Just wait for the compliments."
73910,42976,2006-01-24,5,Great easy yummy cake.......I am going to try to make it tonight with Sugar Free Instant pudding & brown sugar splenda......I will let u know how it turns out.
35714,79944,2008-10-05,5,"Wow! I cooked the entire batch then individually wrapped them and froze them. My DH can grab one from the freezer and toss it in his lunch cooler. It works out great, by noontime it is good to zap for 2 minutes and he has a great lunch! Very Messy to put together, but well worth it. I to skipped the butter and salt, and I used thick cut bacon. Great recipe!"
179133,27445,2007-06-23,4,This was good but a little boring until I added some bbq sauce. Maybe using broth instead of water would help too. It did make for a quick easy lunch. Thanks for the recipe!
6357,35932,2002-11-21,5,"WOW(Caps intended!), Auntie Bev'll! ""Heaven in a pitcher"" indeed this is- you should be ""CROWNED"" - ""THE LEMONADE QUEEN"" for this!
I halved the recipe and made this early today morning using 1 can of 'Everest' brand of Club Soda(355ml) and 1 can of 'Krest' brand of Club Soda (a little over 300 ml). ""WOW WOW WOW"" - I'm not saying it, I'm just echoing what our AC technicians had to say, when after slogging over our broken down central air conditioner this entire ""day"", I handed them a glass each of this refreshing drink. They were thanking me endlessly and I was mentally passing on all the ""Thank You's"" to YOU:) My bro. says he wants to have this on his 18th Birthday(coming up on 24th Nov!) for his friends at his party! THANK YOU A THOUSAND TIMES, you're amazin, simply amazing, just GREAT! "
45636338,12591,2017-02-27,5,I love to bake and needed an angel food cake for a strawberry topping I made.It is by far the best! Thank you so much!
1545551,79606,2013-04-19,3,"I made this last night served over brown rice.  By following others, I doubled the sauce recipe, and should have served it over pasta.  I added extra garlic, as we like to actually be able to taste the garlic, especially in a butter sauce with shrimp!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have to agree with others here, it was smelling AWESOME until the beer.  I removed the shrimp while trying to simmer for &quot;another minute&quot; after adding the beer.  I was quite worried they would over cook and become rubbery.  I&#039;m glad I did, because the &#039;sauce&#039; was way too thin, and I had to thicken it with just a bit of cornstarch.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, a great tasting dish, with my additions....."
394592,306394,2008-10-06,5,"I frequent goneraw so I was familiar w/ this one {{had it stashed in my ""recipe box"" there}}; but had not given it a go until I tagged it playing Healthy Choices Tag here at ZAAR...one helpful hint I found from the person who posted it to GR was to place the cauliflower into the blender until it almost resembles couscous...{{well that's how I liked it}} big hit at my house...the local farm I visit has incredible cauliflower right now and we bought a ""Cheddar"" colored one that added a lot to the visual delight to the dish as well...super good raw dish...Mr. free-free brought some to work where his peeps freaked over it too and wanted the recipe! :) 
->->->->->Thanks for the share...YUMMY!!!"
185446,223058,2008-06-10,5,"These look nice and taste good.  Like other reviewers, I thought a little salt would have enhanced the recipe.  That didn't stop us from eating way too many little potatoes, though!  Thanks, Mandy, for sharing."
1348875,18185,2009-08-11,5,I LOVE this recipe! I needed a quick brunch and this recipe saved me. The best part is NO ROLLING and crust turned out beautifully. Thanks for an AWESOME recipe!
724631,276522,2009-03-04,4,"Very good, simple potatoes, although mine took longer to cook through.  Tarragon would be best with something subtle, but the spice could be varied according to whim to accompany whatever.  Thank you for posting this recipe, MarthaStewartWanabe.  Made for Top Favorites of 2008 Tag, based on the recommendation of WiGal."
1434776,128313,2011-09-19,5,"This was a delightful treat.  The wrap was fresh, light and delicious.  It was as though you were eating a freshly prepared salad with all of the fixins.  Loved it and will add it to my list of ""keepers"".  Thanks for sharing."
160974,101781,2007-02-28,5,"We had guests for dinner and I made  this to go with turkey meatloaf. This really tasted like great gravy and not just mushroom soup! I was surprised that it didn't taste too salty, either, since I usually find that with the canned soups (used regular beef broth and Healthy Choice  Mushroom soup). This made our dinner really special. I am already thinking turkey broth to make a turkey gravy, too. Thanks Packer Backer Pammy."
85018,51524,2004-10-01,5,"Served these today for dinner for the senior citizens at the home where I work.  Went over really well, lots of requests for seconds!  No green onions available, so just minced up some cooking onions.  Used light sour cream and low sodium soup-worked great!!!!  Thanx yooper-I'll be using this recipe again and again!  Mickie"
2000382902,186294,2017-11-03,5,Just made them and best scrambled eggs Iâve ever had. Did have crepe fraiche so used sour cream. I definitely will be making my eggs like this every time .
305531,170156,2007-06-07,4,Delish and simple. We too love chicken and sour cream together and the nutmeg added just the right touch on this. Thanks for sharing. Made for ZWT 3.
593927,254995,2010-12-22,4,"This is a nice chai. Not too sweet which is good. The spices were fine however they left sediment in the bottom of my mug. I used a regular Yellow Label orange pekoe tea bag and since we are dairy free I used homemade almond milk and did not have the sliced almonds on the side, which I think may be meant to go on top. It was good with the almond milk but I was careful not to boil again with it or the honey as it may separate being dairy free and you are not meant to heat honey up. I did use allspice instead of nutmeg as we do not consume intoxicants. Rather than simmer the tea bags 2 minutes I steeped it the same amount of time."
829250,121031,2014-01-05,5,"I don&#039;t even like smores but these are good! Made one and split it between my husband, daughter and myself. Quick and easy to get your chocolate fix."
83093,51883,2007-08-06,5,"A *very* popular dessert at a weekend potluck dinner.  I made it about 8 hours in advance and it held up beautifully. Getting the strawberry topping equally distributed was tricky since my glace was pretty thick even after I thinned it with a bit of water. The one corner that was left became my breakfast this morning, 2 days after making it. I have always heard that Twinkies have a long shelf life and now I believe it. ;-) They were still firm! Thanks for sharing this fun recipe!"
1098997,25972,2013-07-02,5,"Yellow mustard..not brown. Celery salt makes a big difference. If you can&#039;t find sport peppers, hot banana peppers is an ok substitute. Don&#039;t ever put ketchup on a Chicago style hot dog. There are some places in Chicago who will not add it to your hot dog even if you ask. The toppings came from the depression when  hot dog vendors were trying to entice people with extra toppings to fill them up more. People used to order Chicago style dogs by saying &quot;drag it through the garden&quot;."
18391,26030,2002-09-02,5,Yummy muffins!! my husband loved them .. thank you for a great recipe!!
601528,135997,2009-11-04,3,This is a homemade version of one of my husband's favorite meals.....au gratin boxed potatoes with sausage cooked in the oven.  He liked it and I thought it was okay so I'm sure I will make this again.
1579905,252656,2012-03-05,5,These were great!
1036810,11107,2010-03-30,4,This was great! So much better than the box butter noodles! Very easy to make!
283350,112180,2008-10-05,4,"Simple recipe. Great flavor. I replaced the chicken base with ham base to give it a little more complex flavor.

Don't forget to add the Tabasco!"
798181,376737,2011-01-20,5,"What a wonderful drink, so refreshing. Made four your 2010 Football Pool Playoffs. Can't wait to fix a huge batch of this in the summer months"
1057114,512019,2015-06-30,5,This was delicious.  I used fruit I had on hand; 1/2 cup pureed strawberries for the yogurt and three bananas in place of applesauce.  I&#039;ll be making this often.  I love that it doesn&#039;t have white flour and it almost tasted like a mousse.  Problem is I can&#039;t stop eating it.  Thanks for sharing.
1286950,171239,2009-06-04,5,GREAT appetizer!  I used green onions from our garden instead of red onions.  I also put them under the broiler for a minute before serving.  They were a big hit at our dinner party.
199848,64927,2009-07-20,5,"Wonderfully easy side dish!  I used all fresh ingredients, and I highly recommend using fresh.  I used only the butter and no olie oil.  The feta sprinkled on top was a nice finishing touch.  Thanx for sharing!"
2000698974,60743,2016-12-17,0,Folks might want to add a dash of salt (it calls for it in my original recipe.) Recipe should make around 3 1/2 dozen. (My recipe calls for only 1 egg white and 1 cup light brown sugar...but the recipe is basically the same so no need to add a new one. One STRONG suggestion: Do not make these on rainy or very humid days. The will be sticky if you do.
133174,369345,2011-03-05,5,It is amazing what a few choice ingredients can do to add flavor.  These were cooked on the grill in a grill pan.  The chicken was moist and well seasoned.  Served with the salsa and Guacamole Rotel (Recipe #405930).  I do have leftovers and if you add 4 additional tortillas this recipe will easily serve 4.  Made for Aussie Swap.
50509,141522,2011-03-15,4,"I simmered my meat for a couple of hours, then poured in fresh water with some spices and finished cooking. I happened to have a cranberry mustard - I think about 1/4 cup - which I used in the glaze recipe and it turned out just great, the amount of mustard seemed just right. The glaze worked very nicely with the corned beef."
85853,5475,2006-05-13,5,"This was incredibly delicious and somewhat easy on a college budget.  Plus, I like to put as much color in my food as possible, so this was perfect.  "
191533,14860,2005-07-29,5,"I love this useful recipe. Tonight I mixed up the one can amount for the first time- it took about 8-10 minutes to cook it until thick. It doesn't get quite as thick as the store-bought variety, but then of course if you let it cool it will thicken considerably. Thanks SO much for sharing, Charlotte J!"
2000728761,86868,2016-03-16,5,I&#039;ve never made corned beef before but had extra cans of Guinness Draught from the beef stew with Guinness recipe from food.com (also recommend it) and wanted to use the beer instead of drinking it. This recipe is amazingly flavorful and rich. I don&#039;t usually like to boil meat but the 3.5+ hours of boiling the meat and vegetables in the Guinness really works. I also don&#039;t usually like potatoes even in beef stew but they came out as tender and savory as the carrots and cabbage.
33159,23232,2008-02-04,5,"Delicious!  Tender, flavourful meat!!  I loved dipping my sandwich into the ""au jus"" but my hubby thought it was too greasy - silly boy - but he ate 2 sandwiches for dinner & packed 2 in his lunch the next day."
326866,187867,2009-05-16,5,"My family also calls these One Eyed Jack. But I don't toast my bread before hand. I take a slice of bread and cut the center out with a biscuit cutter like you said. I butter the bread on one side, then put some butter in center before breaking egg into it. If someone doesn't like sunny side up eggs, you can scramble the egg before putting into center of bread. If you cook over low-medium, the egg has time to cook correctly and toast bread too. While egg is cooking, I carefully place a tab of butter at all four corners of untoasted side. When egg is set, I turn over with a spatula."
68526,146205,2008-01-18,5,"Made with Christy's Greek salad dressing and it was delicious!  I like the idea of no greens, as sometimes I just get sick of them :)  Thanks for sharing Kitten!

305531,123787,2011-12-02,5,"I love burgers and I really enjoyed this one. Simple, and good. I only varied the recipe by using my favorite onion buns. Thanks Dropbear for a nice meal. Made for Cookbook Tag."
88099,38148,2009-07-31,5,Don't have anything to compare it to but it sure was good in recipe #366057 Thanks for sharing :)
185285,52862,2005-07-16,5,Made this for dinner - quick & easy 'guy-quiche' that DH just loved.  (And he is Quiche-Phoibic).  I think it was the manly-man pepperoni.  I cooked in bakeware and served hot with cheese ontop.
573325,423116,2011-02-18,5,"Oh mmmm, definitely a keeper! Soooooo decadent and yummy and also very easy to make!<br/>I had never had french toast before, cause of the eggs, but always wanted to try it. Your recipe sounded too good to pass it by and it held its promise. The french toast turned out golden, soft (but not mushy) and mmmm yummy!<br/>I used my Recipe #448813 for the bread and that was very nice. I think I would not recommend using fresh bread for this as it would probably get too soft.<br/>Following Prose's suggestion, I reduced the batter to 3/4 cup for half the recipe and still had some left over. It was great with muesli instead of milk.<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this treat with us, Kat!<br/>Made and reviewed for Veggie Swap #31 February 2011."
961163,63943,2008-09-19,1,yuck. maybe i did something wrong. enchiladas came out horrible and the tortillas were very soggy. did not taste good. wont be doing this one again.
2000400617,420383,2016-04-10,5,So good
594139,443511,2011-06-29,5,This is a definite five star recipe and one that we will be enjoying often this summer... The flavour of the glaze is outstanding and smells wonderful whilst cooking.. The only change I made was to add an extra tablespoon of honey as I found it to be little to vinegary with just the one. I also added a little more of both the ginger and coriander.. The ginger was only because after I had chopped it up I realised it was more than 1 tablespoon and the coriander is that I needed to use up what I had left.. Both ingredients were not upped by much.. I made the glaze in the morning and just put it in the fridge so it made for a very quick and easy dinner to throw together when I got in.. I served ours over a couscous salad for totally delicious dinner.. This was a big hit for us Pat thanks for sharing and can recommend it greatly.. A truly delicious way to serve salmon..
2285492,55681,2012-06-05,5,"my grandma was russian and she did this recipie almost just exactly like that...no other veggies, and no grated chunks....just a nice flavoured puree base.<br/><br/>i think she light have slightly friend the beet or onions or both in a little butter ( not too much) for extra flavouring. and she didnt use honey or lemon, maybs sugar ;)"
35140,26789,2002-05-16,5,"I thought this was going to taste more like fruit punch, but the tea reallly comes through.  I used splenda to sweeten it.  I'll definitely make this often - nice change from plain old tea.  Thanks for sharing your recipe."
200343,73781,2005-12-30,3,"I use old fashioned oatmeal, and this did not set at all for me.  

It was still good though :-)"
347822,120459,2007-05-29,2,"I used Hellman's mayo, which was a little overpowering on the sweet side."
490367,156854,2007-08-16,5,"Outstanding!!!! My cousin made these for a family gathering, and they barely made it to the tray... we were eating them out of the pan.  Next time I make them I will try adding dry cherries... mmmmm!Really easy as well!"
98722,226764,2007-05-12,4,"Believe it, these are good.  I was a little skeptical mixing the dough, as it was very dry.  I almost added water but held off.  When they came out of the oven, the oatmeal still seemed a little dry, though the cookies were tasty.  But I put them in an airtight bag, and the next morning, they were perfect!  So give them a chance to rest, and you won't be disappointed."
217657,10125,2005-06-03,5,"We've made these cookies forever,they are practically foolproof!!! Be very careful not to overbake- just till you can barely see the very edge turn brown. They might even look a little doughy, but not shiney doughy. These are actually better the next day but if you can't wait try the freezer for a couple of minutes!!! If you want an oatmeal version I have one where all ingrediants are the same except:
use 1-1/4 c flour
    3-1/2 c quick oats
    no vanilla extract
    ommit the nuts and chips(if you'd like) for 1 c raisins"

173579,118768,2011-02-26,5,This was a great oil and vinegar coleslaw.  My family just raved over it.  Thanks for posting this lovely recipe.
842017,69630,2010-10-16,0,"Wow!!  Thanks, Donna, after trying this recipe, I don't think I'll use another one again!  Since I wanted to have both white and chocolate, I used a box of each cake mix and halved the other ingredients using half for each.( I did take one poster's advice and used a triple chocolate cake mix.)  The textures and flavors are terrific!  Thanks so much for the post!!! :)"
137302,191782,2009-09-29,5,"Ohhhh,  these chops are indeed out of this world good!!!  Both my DH and I relished every bite.  We ladled the sauce over our chops on the plate so that we could actually dip each bite with sauce.  I used pork tenderloin chops and so they were a little less tender than I would prefer.  Next time if I use the same cut I will cook them for a little less time so that they will be a little more tender.  I cooked mine 10 minutes each side.  And YES there will be a next time!!  These are fabulous...and as the chef states don't skip on the spices and the brown sugar!  Made for PAC Fall 2009.

143318,251415,2011-06-08,5,"The creamy, tangy dressing (I used Paul Newman's salsa and lots of lime juice) make this salad! With a pound of ground turkey breast, this can be six meal-sized portions. This is great to have in the fridge for lunches all week - leave the dressing and chips off until just before serving, and add a new item or two every day to keep it interesting!"
1366254,423338,2010-05-05,5,I love the children's world cookbook.. our copy around here is well used and battered. This is a great way to let kids eat veggies
247362,119804,2007-09-08,5,"Kittencal,
I've never gone wrong with any of your recipes. This was a delightfully light snack cake that takes only a few minutes to put together. I make my own yogurt and used the low fat (skim milk) version also the half cup of sugar was plenty for our tastes. This is a great cake for hurried weeknight dinners and leftovers for the lunch box the next day. The entire family asked for this one again. Thanks for sharing!"
242729,211152,2008-02-19,5,"Elly - MERCI BEAUCOUP! This is a recipe that will be made many times in our house, as we BOTH loved it! So easy and yet such a brilliant combination of flavours - just wonderful. I used a LITTLE less Gorgonzola than listed, it was all I had left......but we loved it as it was! We ate this with crispy garlic bread and a large mixed salad......so good! Made for Adopt a Recipe Swap Photo in the Photos Forum - BUT, now I have discovered this recipe, it will be made many times again! Thanks - FT:-)"
29014,69135,2004-04-19,4,"These burgers had great flavor.  I made the recipe exactly as posted, except I made four patties instead of six.  We grilled these and they really fell apart on the grill - will try frying next time!"
179133,213167,2007-05-26,4,These were tasty and very easy to make. I think next time I will bake them a few minutes longer and maybe add another blueberry or two to each one. The cinnamon-sugar on top really added something special and I recommend using lots of it. :) I liked them best at room temperature. Thanks for the recipe Karen!
41984,92016,2013-12-31,4,"I chose this to make for the holidays.  I made it as directed and was disappointed that most of the topping fell off of the bread when I took the bread out of the pan.  I had expected the topping to sort of liquify and make some sort of a glaze I guess.  I think that if I try this again, I&#039;d include some chopped pecans in the batter and add a streusel topping.  Thank you for posting this recipe."
511663,240595,2007-07-16,4,"This is such a great idea - I make it every year as well - the color is beautiful and taste is much fresher than bought.  I add a bit of edible glycerin from the natural food store to smooth it out.  You can also buy the 'shrink-to-fit' plastic tops from brewing supply stores.  You slipthem over the corked top, dip them in boilong water, and voila - they shrink around the bottle to look very fancy indeed!  thanks for the posting, Chef Potpie!"
382999,226218,2007-06-03,5,"This isn't at all difficult to make!  I used a strongly flavored Spanish chorizo, which is what is available for this recipe in my neck of the woods.  The cooking times were perfect!  I had some leftovers, and didn't like it as much as when I first made it, because the rice became softer with the leftovers.  First time cooked, however, the rice was perfect, as was the chicken!  I made this for ZWT 3.  Photo is uploaded."
22015,41035,2004-08-05,5,"I am a jelly novice.  I love the idea of using the ""leavings"" to get all the flavor and vitamins possible from the fruit.  I didn't get 8 pints though.  I made a double batch and ended up with 9 half pints and a little left over.  The taste is wonderful - it's probably a good thing I don't have any bread in the house - Thanks for posting."
923456,28603,2009-04-07,5,"Made this during the fall season for the first time ,my family loved it ,I made 3 times in the month of October...What a great fall treat!!"
80353,287689,2010-06-19,5,Made for breakfast today and we all really liked it.  Strange-looking but tasty - the custardy-crust was really good.  Thanks.
361719,92323,2007-06-13,5,This is so very good. I added 1 cup peanut butter to the mix so I could have more peanit butter taste. Plus I used 1/2 cup sweetened condenced milk in the mix just so I wouldn't have to throw out the rest in the can. Was wonderful!! Very moist very Yummy. LOVED IT!!
705251,280905,2008-02-11,5,DuChick - my family really enjoyed this meal. It was so simple to put together that my 13 yo DD made dinner for the family on a night when I was at meetings at evening. Because she was not comfortable with the green onions she just used dried onions while browning the beef but I know either way they are great!  These will be a staple for those quick night meals I need for our busy family!  Thanks for a great addition to my cookbooks!
464085,192571,2008-03-20,5,"This was great.  I have been looking for a new way to cook turkey breast & I have found it.  I used a 4lb boneless breast and it turned out perfectly.  The only deviation I made was to brine the breast for 1 hour in salt water prior to beginning.  The leftovers were great in my sandwich today at lunch too!  The glaze really made my tongue think ham, but my waistline say turkey."
23651,31349,2006-11-29,5,Delish...  I have already made them again since Thanksgiving.  I poated them with credit to you on my group of friends site and were asked by familty members for the recipe an T-Day.  Loved them and the water chestnuts were a hit.
2002151003,234465,2018-05-13,5,"I, too, have been making Ina's recipe since I first saw her make it on one of her shows, and my chicken comes out moist and flavorful every time. I've used this recipe each and every time that I've needed chopped chicken in a recipe, whether it be for a soup or salad. However, contrary to other posters, I have always used Ina's method of roasting bone-in chicken breasts with the skin on. That way the skin keeps the chicken from drying out while it is cooking. Trust Ina to know the absolute best way to make everything, but especially chicken, since that is one of Jeffrey's favorite things to eat :) :) :)"
144431,31386,2006-04-25,5,Very easy and yummy.  I used cherries that I had marinated in chocolate liqueur; they were a hit.  Thank you!
180898,37625,2006-03-13,5,"YUM!!! We didn't have the right sized pan so did this in 2 round pie plates which worked very well. We also had to cook it for much longer than the recipe called. Very easy and so good. If you are looking for a little something gooey try topping a slice of the cake with a dollop of your favorite jam (I like apricot)and pop it in the micro for about 15 seconds or so, just until it starts to melt. Thank you for a great recipe. I am sure we will make this often."
88099,137081,2006-06-09,5,These are excellent tasting cookies.  I made various shapes from O to S and horseshoes also.  Fairly easy to work with if you work fast.  Love the texture and flavor.  Thanks Toni
81611,157475,2008-03-02,4,"I made the banana version, and left in the spices, because I love spices in my banana breads. I was initially disappointed at the flavor and texture, however, when toasted up, I was delighted at the crispy outside and melt-in-your-mouth inside."
376378,126714,2007-05-09,5,This was the absolute QUICKEST!  The kids liked it a lot and I put turkey breast on mine because I eat a lower fat diet and even then it was awesome.  I think I would half the butter though and make it healthier without sacrificing any taste.
250031,358199,2010-09-09,4,"I used tilapia filets. This was good and may have been better if I were cooking on a familiar stove (I have gas; boyfriend has electric). I didn't use sesame seeds (didn't have any). I'll make this again and if it does better on my gas stove, I'll revise my stars to five. It *was* tasty and easy and I liked dredging it in egg/flour to help seal the breading."
599450,327793,2009-04-13,5,"Very quick, delicious, and satisfying. I like dishes like this that do not require noodles or rice as a base for the sauce; this sauce is really for the meat. Thanks, FoodieFinn! Made for <b>PAC Spring '09</b>."
178220,95725,2006-05-30,4,"This was quite good. Instead of basting, I added a bit more white wine (instead of sherry) and marinaded.  I used a lot more garlic then called for, as my roommate and I are garlic lovers.  Made it with both chicken and shrimp and it was excellent.  Thank you for the good recipe!"
318235,53878,2009-07-13,5,"Easy and delicious. Couldn't ask for anything more, and they were eaten up very quickly at our 4th of July bbq. In the future I will probably mince the pepperoni in a food processor and then add the cream cheese at room temperature and mix to make the process even easier. Thanks again!"
836852,108364,2011-08-24,5,Love Love Love this recipe!!  Have made this countless times and never fails to be a winner at my house. I cut the hot sauce by half for my little ones but the flavor is still great.
490843,123549,2009-03-06,5,Made this cake yesterday and it is really good!  I used a l0 inch springform pan.  Also I cooked the cake mix about l0 minutes more than called for  before I put the cream cheese mixture on.  I will me making this again.  It sounds like lots of work but it really isn't.
693185,238720,2016-05-18,5,"Delicious breakfast bars! Excellent to serve with a cup of tea or coffee. I do agree with another reviewer, that this in no way makes 18 servings. Regardless of number of servings, it is quite yummy!"
11009,123107,2007-09-03,5,easy to make and easy to adjust to your family's preferences. I don't care for sweet salads so I used dill pickle relish and controlled the sweetness with the sugar (or splenda works nice too.
42798,67484,2010-01-25,5,"I made this with half-and-half instead of heavy cream, and it was still delicious.  The whisking the cocoa into the chocolate and then the milk did not go well, and I was left with lumps.  Next time I'll try some of the other reviewers' suggestions.  And there will be a next time!"
297076,81141,2008-01-20,5,"Wow. This was WONDERFUL. Tom made this for a girl's night tonight and I got a sneak taste. YUM YUM YUM. And it's so pretty if you use real bacon, I took a picture to share :)"
55578,45246,2006-10-07,5,I love this easy recipe.  It goes together in a snap and everyone enjoys it.  Thanks!
785604,83203,2008-05-18,5,"Scrumptious! The first time I made this using thighs, the second time with boneless, skinless breasts, and then I tried to adapt it to my crock pot!  I need to do some tweaking to make it work in the crock pot!  I did sub vegetable oil because that's what i had.  Served over rice along with some veggies.  Try this recipe...your mouth will thank you!"
240668,224267,2008-03-17,4,"Light and delicious; this is a good one for asparagus lovers.  We used 4 big cloves of garlic, which was almost a little too garlicky, but otherwise it was very good.  We also used angel hair pasta because we prefer the texture."
29655,238351,2008-07-11,5,"Excellent!  So good, I had to call my Greek neighbor to come over and give me her opinion. Five stars all the way!  I used an entire pound of lamb along with the ground beef.  I also served these with bleu cheese and ranch dressing to dip them in (that's what was available).  DD (6 y.o.) had fun (and did great) helping to roll. Reviewed for ZWT4."
451055,3092,2009-08-25,5,"So sorry that I forgot to review this.  We used this almost 2 years ago! for my daughter's sweet 16 party where we played Fear Factor games.  
These really looked real.  We did have a bit of trouble with the first few, but then we found that holding the end of the straw with needle-nosed pliers helped a lot.  Also, be sure to run the worms under hot water long enough.  We were afraid that they would melt, but found that if you do it correctly, they will remove with ease and have a glossy appearance to them.
Thanks for a great gross-out recipe."
1467077,150863,2011-05-12,5,This is the best soup ever! I make it for functions and freeze it for those lazy dinner nights. Everyone LOVES it!!
864006,52950,2008-11-20,0,This was good and I don't  understand the previous comment.  This recipe seems low-carb to me.
163112,320148,2008-10-15,4,"Very yummy.  I doubled it & the 4 of us finished it.  Also, it takes more like an hour to cook the peas.  But it's delicious.  Made for PAC Fall '08."
169430,169079,2007-04-03,5,"Delicious cookies. I was expecting a cookie that would spread out and be thin but these don't spread at all and come out like tender, sweet pillows. I made a 1/2 recipe which ask for 1/2 a cup of butter, I used 2 tbsp of it and filled the rest of the 1/2 cup with unsweetened apple sauce. I used 3/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon alone. I couldn't be more pleased with the finished cookies. As I didn't have flax seed I added another tbsp of flour.These will be great all year round but will definitely make a Christmas appearance as well."
537500,68036,2010-07-24,5,"Wonderful!  With my little ice cream maker it came out the consistency of soft serve, but a trip to the freezer tightened it up.  Delicious flavor of fresh berries.  We'll definitely be making this when strawberries are in season."
39653,3875,2003-03-12,0,This was absolutely a waste of ingredients. The measurements have to be wrong.
420166,89204,2009-08-12,5,Excellent!  I used fat free cream cheese and it was still very rich!
222055,158447,2007-12-03,5,"I used 5 Granny Smith apples, but the same amount of everything else. We are having this with corned beef and cabbage. Mmmmm mmmm! Thank you my Sweet Angel in Heaven! Always, Remembering Amy!!!!"
482376,268393,2009-12-31,5,"Originally rated on 3/14/09 - This recipe made it into my book#266453. Fantastic!!! I loved the flavor combination here. I was worried because I didn't have coconut vinegar and just used white vinegar. It was still FABULOUS. Also, I couldn't find red chilies so I subbed jalapenos and added a little chopped sweet red pepper for color. For the peanuts, I just used regular salted peanuts, without roasting them. The relish flavor is out of this world and I could eat a whole bowl without anything else!!! Note: Don't add all of your liquid to the relish at once. I only added about half of the liquid and it was plently. Use your judgement. I served this relish atop recipe#268295. YUM!"
524494,76857,2007-08-11,5,"I really loved this recipe. the sauce is so creamy (I did increase the amount of sauce, while leaving the serving of pasta the same) and so tasty. This is one of my kids favorites!! I replaced the fettucini with whole wheat spaghetti and it still turned out wonderful."
377039,73825,2013-02-17,4,"This was quite good. It wasn't like most carrot cakes I've had before, but it tasted good and got even better after sitting for a day.  I loved the icing but my husband said that was where he thought it was lacking.  Next time, I'll sub a cup of brown sugar instead of 1 3/4 cup white sugar, and skip the coconut, and maybe add raisins. I thought the coconut made it very chewy and didn't add to the overall flavor. I'll also add some extra spice; nutmeg and clove, perhaps, as other reviewers have suggested."
32143,24054,2008-04-25,4,"This was very good, but a little too spicy for my husband and daughter (they still ate it). I doubled the sauce (but not the salt and pepper), and would add more meat next time. I served with Recipe#130916 and steamed veggies. Will make again, thank-you!"
769890,1633,2009-02-08,4,Yummy...I wouldn't try to say they taste like McD's but I found the texture to be similar and my kids loved the idea of using soda in their breakfast! I'm keeping this one for the next Girl Scout camp out!  Thanks!
424680,225294,2007-05-19,5,"This recipe I tagged without realizing that one of the ingredients is coffee powder, so leave it to me, I excluded it, & guess what ~ even without the coffee, this is a really great tasting chocolate pie, & in a chocolate pastry pie shell, at that! If you're looking for THE chocolate pie recipe, people, HERE IT IS! Thanks so much for posting this recipe!"
209255,140136,2008-01-31,5,Wow!  These are awesome!  I used bran flakes to try and make them that little bit healthier.  It worked great.  You can't tell that there is healthy stuff hiding inside!  These will be a great treat for my sons... if I leave them any!  Thank you so much for sharing!
2000177785,504628,2015-07-19,5,"This recipe was easy to follow and made an excellent cake. I have a soft spot for apple crumble and was looking around for something different to do with my sourdough (discard) starter. I am so glad I found this recipe. At first I thought it used a lot of honey, but it turned out to not be too sweet at all (at least for me). I used chopped almonds and walnuts instead of pecan nuts and substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil. Really tasty dessert and one I will be making more often. Thank you!"
178116,151544,2009-07-26,5,This really fixed a problem! I had made strawberry jam that did not set-it slid right off the toast!  Now my jam is set up just like it should be. Thanks RecipeMonster!
847649,10145,2008-06-06,5,Easy and excellent. I marinated the chicken in the lemon juice for a couple of hours. That was the only change I made. We really enjoy this recipe in our house.
206722,135210,2005-09-14,4,"These were *fabulous* until I added the parsley, dill and basil. I think the amount was just too much, as they overpowered the mushrooms and the other seasonings.  I used baby portabellos and sliced them thick rather than using just the caps.  That was the only change I made to the recipe. Next time I will either cut down on the final herbs or just omit them entirely.  "
379033,206716,2008-12-05,5,"I have made a similar recipe before, so when I seen this, I had to make it.  I just want to tell people - don't be afraid of anchovies!  They literaly melt as they cook.  Leaving a nutty taste behind.  Nothing fishy about it to me.  I used only 1 tsp red pepper flakes, and for me that is just perfect.    This is a quick and easy recipe to do.  Thanks Kittencal for posting this!"
128473,92620,2005-11-14,5,Thanks for sharing Charmed. These cookies are great...I made some with and (without almonds for my DH). Both batches turned out beautifully. They were easy to make and nicely spiced.
2001644477,258767,2017-09-10,2,I
336145,177583,2006-07-22,1,"This was the biggest recipe disappointment of my life.  There's no baking powder or soda listed, so the cake didn't rise AT ALL.  This was going to be for my Mom's 77th birthday party tomorrow, so I had to resort to baking a boxed mix.  She deserves better."
222564,299086,2013-06-29,5,"Nicely balanced dish, light and heavy all at the same time. Tasty in a subtle way. As suggested, might work out well just sauteed, without breading the calamari, just to make it a bit lighter."
1394450,147497,2009-09-24,5,"These were tasy. These were yummy. These were lumpy :) . I like lumpy. I used applesauce in the place of butter and added Crazins, a tsp of vanilla, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, and lastley 1/8 tsp ground cloves. I only had to cook them for 10 min :) . They are YUMMMYY! Thanks! 
-Me"
653438,146830,2009-12-09,5,Made for Let's P-A-R-T-Y tag game 2009...Delicious!!  Cut the recipe in half for DH and I (I have some leftover for lunch...yummy) but otherwise followed the directions.  I served it with Recipe#34335#34335 and Recipe#79571#79571.  Will be making this quite often.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.
485728,197624,2009-09-15,5,"Wow, this salad is incredible!   There is so much flavor packed into such little pasta.  I followed the recipe exactly other than omitting the optional nuts, and I loved the way all of the ingredients came together.  I was worried that it would be overpoweringly sweet, but it ended up being a perfect blend between sweet, savory, and spicy.  The spice mix is wonderful and smells divine while toasting.  This will definitely be a favorite of mine from now on.  Thanks for the lovely recipe!"
2279366,33919,2014-01-07,5,Wonderful! I made this to recipe and our family LOVED it! We may add a can of green chiles as suggested next time to give it a little kick.
1616302,51140,2010-10-16,5,Amazing chili! You really don't miss the meat. I shredded the zucchini out of laziness and think it worked out wonderfully. I can't wait to make this again.
2000257847,211485,2015-06-13,4,"I&#039;ve always loved the flavor of honey chicken, but never quite knew how to get the right combination of ingredients. This was perfect! I didn&#039;t have dijon mustard, but I was super eager to try this, so I actually used yellow mustard; turned out delicious. The only thing for me was that there was too much ginger for my taste, so I think next time I won&#039;t quite add as much. Still one of my new (and easy!) favorite recipes!"
634257,20643,2011-12-14,5,"Made this with Recipe #328562 (Baked Chicken Teriyaki).  I left out the celery since I didn't have any and I substituted butter for the oleo.  This was quite possibly one of the most delicious fried rice recipes I've ever made, and oh so easy!  Was a wonderful compliment to the baked teriyaki chicken.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for sharing!"
201584,125813,2005-06-14,1,Omg.
147050,129408,2009-02-08,5,Great flavor and easy to make
1168865,140377,2009-04-18,5,"I made these with my little cousins who really liked them, and they don't make much mess either :-) Made for PAC 2009"
53932,43280,2005-10-31,5,I didn't let sauce simmer for as long as I should have and it was still tasty.  The sauce was a bit on the sweeter side so I might decrease the brown sugar somewhat.  Thanks for sharing.
116856,43737,2011-05-19,5,very flavourful and easy to make!!
53932,16193,2005-11-05,3,"Sorry, but I didn't really care for this.  I found the flour to overwhelm all the other ingredients and could only taste that. I only added provolone cheese so perhaps more add ins would have helped? "
65955,35948,2005-01-17,5,"We had this with our Christmas ham, and it was a lovely, fresh compliment to the heavier foods of the day. I could not get watercress, but the vinaigrette had a lovely flavor. Thanks for posting."
1346699,140047,2009-08-10,5,"The chicken really turned out nice and juicy. I only had time to marinade it for a couple of hours, but it was amazing still!"
174096,6886,2010-01-11,5,"This is great, such a nice, soothing blend.  I used green tea with a hint of lemon.  Thanks for sharing!"
617669,19068,2008-07-31,5,"The first time I made this was at my pampered chef wedding shower, and my hubby and I love this! He is very picky, so I don't use any veggies except the onion. So for all you non vegers, it is still amazing without them. I have also used mozerella cheese, and it is wonderful also."
62191,8603,2005-04-20,5,"Great recipe. Easy to put together. I doubled the recipe and baked in jumbo size muffin tins for 30 minutes. Turned out perfectly. I love the texture, and the flavor is wonderful."
199848,285271,2012-04-06,5,"Very nice combination of colors and flavors.  I made this according to the recipe, but used cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  I probably used less salt than listed (I think the amount of salt depends on the saltiness of the bacon used).  This will be ideal for summer picnics.  Thanx!"
37636,31514,2002-07-08,5,"Hands down, this recipe is an absolute winner! I made this recipe exactly as stated, except that I used fresh Thai chilies instead of the dried red chili peppers. I couldn't believe the wonderful aromas while this was cooking! And the sauce on this was amazing, complex, and full of flavor. The lemongrass was very aromatic as well as the garlic, but neither served to overpower any of the other flavors which combined into a heavenly melange that will win anyone over to Asian food. I will definitely be making this again, and again, and again...Thanks, Izzy! :)"
222433,43023,2006-08-23,5,Really good and fast. Great with sauted zucchini from the garden!! The whole family loved it! Thanks Karen! Will be making this again!
177851,85762,2004-12-02,5,This is soooo easy and SUPERB!!!!
169969,54872,2005-10-31,5,"This was my first ever attempt at baklava! I like my baklava syrupy so I followed Donna Matthews measurements from her review. However, I am not sure if i even needed to do this after all. These were delicious! I had a little helper in the kitchen and we had such a ball making these! Thanks Rita!"
133174,116350,2005-02-26,5,Thank you for the by hand directions.  Actually I even took it a step further and used my Kitchenaid Mixer and dough hooks.  Worked like a charm.  These rolls are slightly sweet with a light lemon glaze.  I glazed part and left part plain.  They are nice and soft.  Great for an elegant brunch!
140819,57225,2004-05-10,0,"This was absolutely horrible.  After baking 40 minutes it was beautiful and tested done with a toothpick.  But within 5 minutes of cooling it had collapsed into a 1"" tall gooey mess.  What did I do wrong?  Did the recipe mean potato starch or potato flour?"
126104,137962,2008-03-08,5,"A dear friend recommended this recipe, and I wondered if it was as good as she said.  It was.

I made waffles from scratch.  I probably overcooked them slightly, but that worked.  I did flip the eggs over, and one yellow survived.   I ended up putting all the syrup in the pan on that 1-1/2 waffle and 2 eggs, and I had a lovely dinner.  I decided I didn't want to wait until breakfast to enjoy.

Wonderful recipe, Laurie."
170271,358883,2014-11-12,4,yum!  sauce was thinner than I expected.  you could &quot;tighten&quot; it up if desired.  I did not use white wine and just added extra stock.
155607,90688,2004-08-02,4,"I've made this a few times now and the reaction is always the same!!! I want seconds ! I made it for a breakfast at a ""girls"" weekend and all loved it. It's so easy and yummy, I love the ""do it the night before and pop in the oven ease"" next day.
The only difference I made was in Australia we don't have 1/2&1/2 so I used a mix of cream and milk, but that was too sloppy, so next time I used more cream and less milk and it was fine. Fat content up, but a once in a while treat is ok!

431813,95177,2009-05-09,4,"Very tasty fruit loaf!  I added a couple of teaspoons of ground cardamom for some extra flavour, otherwise made exactly as stated.  Yum!  Thanks Mercy!"
185285,75324,2005-04-16,5,"Ok-- so MEAN tends to do things the, eh-em... longer route?  THIS IS SO WORTH IT!  Yum!  These are great warm, but wonderful later as well."
282745,54257,2007-02-11,5,As if this recipe needs another 5 star rating but here I am anyway!  Absolutely excellent.  I used a can of tomato sauce instead of ketchup and I also added a couple cloves of garlic and a stalk of celery finely chopped.  The sauce is what made this meatloaf stand out.  I was unsure how my family would like a meatloaf with brown sugar on it but the sweetness really just offset the savory and didn't stand out so much.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's going to permanent printing.
107135,378272,2012-01-07,5,this is a very good dip with corn chips i didnt use as much chili powder cause im around light weight s
394077,60956,2007-05-24,5,Love it.  Thank you for the recipe.
423565,24978,2008-02-07,5,"Thank you, SO MUCH, for posting this recipe. It's exactly what I've been looking for!!! The only substitutions I made were to double the yeast and add a small handful of raw pine nuts (which I found out was rather futile - save your money and don't bother). I ran it though the dough cycle, then made two small loaves. I cut X's in the top of the loaves, topped with a bit more oatmeal and a light coating of butter, and baked at 350 degrees for 35 minutes on a pizza stone. 'Served it with home-made honey butter. I will, definitely, be making this often!!!"
63427,102073,2009-10-13,5,Amazing!  I used fresh pumpkin (tis the season!) and it was amazing.  I used http://www.recipezaar.com/Kittencals-No-Fail-Buttery-Flakey-Pie-PastryCrust-66929 as the pastry dough.  Simply the best pumpkin pie IÃ¢â¬â¢ve ever had.  Everyone raved!  I am going to freeze a bunch of fresh pumpkin so that I can make it again in the off season!
58469,28208,2005-12-13,5,Very good and simple to make. Will make this again!
164429,41156,2009-08-11,5,This certainly doesn't NEED another review but I just made these and WOW .......they are delicious. I did only cook mine for 12 minutes as we like them only slightly browned. Thanks for a real winner of a recipe...
1137364,50719,2009-01-20,5,Very yummy!!  Light texture with tons of blueberries.
149415,316640,2009-03-12,4,"It was good, we liked it. I actually used a pork loin (2 lbs) and 1/2d the marinade. I did bake the pork loin in the marinade to increase flavor to the meat. Thanks."
13483,68312,2006-06-16,5,Ah nothing like the old 70's self saucing cake eh??  This was good served with a bit of whip cream.  I would have liked a bit more sauce so next time I'll just make more sauce!!  Thanks Cornelia
605866,344595,2009-12-05,5,"My husband and I really liked this pasta, however we did make some changes to make it our own. Thank you, Nif, for the basis of our now favorite pasta!! We added red pepper flakes and garlic powder to the sauce, omitted the pesto (because we didn't have any) and added a 6oz can of chopped clams and juice. It tasted decadent, but without all the fat. Plus, my husband said it was good the next day. Thank you again!"
1108916,279314,2009-08-16,5,I've always wanted to make eclairs.  This was so easy that I now have a signature dessert.
527754,33671,2012-12-22,5,"I am making this chicken for the 3rd time in the last month!  I just put a  7 lb bird in the crockpot because my son, his wife and 2 small children are coming to visit from Chicago.  These are the very important things I learned from reading many of the reviews.  I cut my salt to 1 tsp, used half the amount of cayenne, and 1 tsp. total of pepper.  I lifted the breast skin and put the seasoning under it, also 2 small pats of butter.  I seasoned the cavity well and sprikled the rest of the seasoning over the rest of the chicken.  In the cavity I placed 2 crushed cloves of garlic, slices from half a lemon and a large sprig of rosemary from my garden bended in half.  This is what I have done each time and it has been amazing.<br/><br/>If you read a recipe and it sounds like too much salt or anything else use common sense and don't use so much.  I think some of the folks are cooking these chickens too long, I have been able to lift the bird (carefully) from the crockpot with succulent, moist tender meat including the breast.  My 6qt oval Crockpot cooks a 5 lb chicken on low in around 5-6 hours.  <br/><br/>Like everyone says, chill that broth and remove the fat which will harden on top for some amazing chicken noodle soup!  I have not tried putting the bones back in to simmer but plan to this time.<br/><br/>I NEVER expected this recipe to be so good and it it fabulous!!!  Thank you so much!"
733994,486450,2014-04-29,5,Delicious!  I used this for pork chops but look forward to trying it with chicken also.
166475,26110,2009-09-28,4,"These were good, but a little too ""cakey"" for my tastes.  They also didn't rise as well I had hoped."
1020526,339396,2009-01-03,5,"This was perfect!  I was looking for a recipe that didn't require a trip to the store for ingredients, and I wanted to use up what I already had on hand.  This is delicious and simple to make and surprisingly healthy too!  I didn't have creamed corn, but I threw in some frozen peas instead.  Next time I'll throw in some cayenne pepper or some spicy chilies for more heat.  THANK YOU FOR POSTING!"
446523,279180,2008-02-27,5,fantastic.  great tasting easy marinade Made for  CUPID'S CHOICE BEVY TAG Feb 08.
1133190,181181,2012-11-26,4,These were very tasty! I made these cupcakes for my daughters first birthday.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The cake was more dense than box mixes and had had a hint of sugar cookie in the flavor.  Ideally I'd like to find a homemade vanilla recipe that is a little lighter in texture but the flavor of this recipe is great!!
1986928,170357,2012-06-04,5,"These were a huge hit with my guys.  A bit more time consuming than regular muffins, but much much much healthier than a bag of the ready mix kind. I halved it and it made EXACTLY six standard sized muffins with no leftover batter!  The apple slices on top make for a great presentation and taste great after baking.  Next time I'll add a bit more brown sugar, but other than that, amazing recipe.  Thanks!"
140211,17233,2004-05-26,5,The smell was awesome! The texture was perfect.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.
306897,111377,2007-01-31,4,"yeah i saw this at the back of a barilla box, and it makes lovely pasta. i served it with shrimp (Recipe #126599) and everybody loved it ;)

suggestions: i used linguini pasta instead and added tomato sauce (tomato sauce water mix to make sure it's not too thick.. this way the pasta stays moist).. plus i used canned peeled tomatoes as they are much softer in texture."
239923,83561,2006-12-07,5,"What a hit!!!  I used almost 5 lbs. of leg quarters and doubled the rest of the ingredients.  I needed 10 minutes cooking time for the extra chicken.  My 8yr old aspiring chef was able to prepare this with very little help from me, a HUGE bonus!  I can't wait to try this with all different cuts of chicken.  This is a wonderful, flavorful, and easy chicken recipe.  It gets 8 stars in my book!  Thanks for sharing.  
I used two pans, one glass and one metal, and sprayed with cooking spray instead of using foil.  After dinner the mess rinsed right off of both."
400708,61074,2009-09-08,4,"Quick, easy and very tasty; great way to serve fresh bass fillets.  A neighbor gave us a lot of these fillets and I'd never made them before so started searching Zaar and so glad I found this one - I always worry about over cooking fish and followed this recipe exactly including cook times and it came out perfect.  Served with garden fresh tomatoes salad and corn and it made a wonderful dinner.  Thanks Chuck for a very nice recipe"
200930,81845,2008-01-18,5,Very tasty!  We really enjoyed this with blue chips!
2001035295,322155,2018-11-15,5,This is a wonderful recipe although I only use half a cup of Splenda and about 1-1/2 Tableoons butter. Yum!
400708,451373,2011-04-10,5,What a great way to prepare tilapia.  It was so easy and cooked up fast.  I wanted a healthier way to prepare it that picky DGS would eat.  He always says he only likes things deep fried or dripping in grease so I just didn't tell him this was baked and he never knew the differance.  Just kept saying I love fried tilapia!!  The panko makes for a wonderful crispy crust and the spices were perfect.   Even enjoyed the tarter sauce with it.
593927,277556,2011-08-10,5,"Very good. I used keshta which is thick cream that comes in a can and is available in Middle Eastern and Persian stores. I wonder what exact type of cream Iranians use for this breakfast generally? I served it with a creamed, local, organic, raw, honey as part of suhoor (breakfast before the dawn and fajr prayer during Ramadan) I would use this recipe again."
422893,369273,2010-04-27,5,"Lovely crisp spuds with a great ""twang"" from the lemon. Rather than use good broth, I used stock cubes & water to save on waste, worked a treat."
522122,24598,2013-01-09,4,"I made this into a quick meal by adding couscous. The flavors work well together. I added some lemon juice and black pepper. Very fast, easy, tasty and original vegan cuisine."
92385,59965,2005-04-05,5,"So easy and tastes great! Only thing I can add is -don't scrape up any of the browned garlic bits at the bottom of the cooking dish, as they are bitter. Thanks for posting!"
395252,133089,2007-06-28,4,"This was really tasty! I made mine without cilantro as I realised too late that cilantro is actually corriander leaf and so didn't get any in. Even without though it was really tasty and really perked up my salmon. I will definitely have this again - probably with tuna and other fish too. My only qualm (perhaps cos of the missing cilantro, but I can't imagine that's the reason) was that it was a bit dry and I had to add a bit more lime juice. Perhaps my limes were just not ripe enough or something. Either way, this was a really tasty dish and the lime salsa is a definite keeper. Thanks NcMysteryShopper!"
741288,33921,2008-02-13,5,"Exceptional and easy, best of all realllly tasty! Only recommendation is to add 1 Tbs worsheareter (sp) sauce and hardboiled egg. Thanks for a super supper!"
304147,115440,2010-02-03,5,we loved this recipe!  definitely keep the jalapenos to a minimum and allow each person to add their own.  Yum!!!
667928,50495,2010-10-20,5,"This was so easy and really delicious! I added green beans, corn, carrots and celery. I also used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken instead of 2 chicken. I added some other herbs and spices and some cornstarch to thicken it up a little. My fiance and I don't have time to cook since we are in school and this was just perfect. I don't think you can tell the difference between the biscuits and homemade dumplings. Thank you so much for posting!"
1175059,150473,2009-03-19,5,Followed the recipe exactly and they were deeelish!
359833,202998,2008-02-14,3,"This was ok; a little bland for my taste, and WAY too many peas.  I used some extra mushrooms and some julienned carrots which I cooked along with the onions and mushrooms.  Next time I will use about 1/4 the amount of peas and add some more zing - maybe some Old Bay seasoning, or cayenne?  Not sure.  I'm still learning how to cook, so this was a good lesson in how to make an easy cream sauce.  Will just have to customize it a bit more next time.  Thanks for the recipe."
1366151,53812,2009-08-27,4,"Admittedly, the recipe is not very well written, but it's both a tasty and attractive dish, very fragrant."
323186,306260,2009-06-19,5,"I'm still quite new to mexican food, so it's always an adventure, but the family are really enjoying it!  These were marvellous, nice and cheesy, with a tasty tomato sauce.   I didn't make the tortillas, sorry about that,  but I had a packet in the freezer, so chose to use those instead.  
I made guacamole and sour cream to accompany the dish, and we polished off everything,  thanks for a lovely supper, Chef On The Coast!

526666,149189,2013-04-11,5,"Delicious! I whipped this up to share with a friend who was going through a sad time - I think it even cheered her up a bit! I did split it in half, making 2; one to share and one to enjoy myself! Don&#039;t tell! This was easy, a little different than most of these type recipes and I usually have the ingredients on hand. Thanks for sharing, Patty-cake!"
2899186,156004,2013-07-12,5,This Jamaican Rum Punch is perfect!!!! It tastes just like I am back in Jamaica sitting on the beach. I have made it a few times already and enjoy it so much!
160974,144023,2006-10-02,5,"I was looking for a carrot salad type recipe and your dressing sounded good. I didn't have any cucumbers but I did use diced zucchini, raw broccoli florets, and a few dried cranberries. This was really delicious tasting. The honey is great with the cider vinegar.The hot sauce gives it a slight zing, that I can see would go well with  cucumber. Thanks Shandibear!

82616,249410,2007-10-23,5,Fantastic made these for PAC orphanage 07 and wasn't disappointed.
4470,15918,2004-04-10,5,"I cut up the sweet potatoe laid them out on paper towel in a single layer then lightly sprayed them with lite olive oil, mixed the dry ingredients and garlic in a plastic bag, put the lightly oiled tater in and shook,  Watch when you bake them they do cook quickly.
I loved this recipe, great flavor and a nice change from so many other sweet potatoe recipes.  Definately do again Thanks KJ"
37449,44073,2002-10-30,5,"Oooooh, this is just too good! Rich, creamy, with a nice little kick! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used green pepper instead of yellow. Excellent taste treat!"
149363,120783,2005-05-11,5,"This was awesome! I love spaghetti squash, and the bacon was a super addition in flavour.
The only thing I did differently was to add some parmesan cheese, other wise I followed directions.
My 4 year old even ate 2 big bites, and that's saying alot!
Thanks for a keeper Dancer!"
450588,22782,2007-06-11,5,"WOW WOW WOW... OK, I looked at this recipe a hundred times and always thought about making it. We have an incredible chain of Italian markets here and yesterday I piccked up some Italian Sausage and thought now I am committed to your recipe.
I have to admit that I changed things a little.... here is what I did (sorry sharlene) 
I did a 50/50 mix of ground chuck and sweet bulk sausage...doubled the onion and added 1/2 green and 1/2 red bell pepper. In addition I added 2 carrots. I know the carrot thing sounds a little odd but this came from an Italian neighbor that made what I then thought was the best sauce. I put the carrot in te food processor until it was pretty fine, then added the onion, peppers and garlic and did the same. The after browning the meats I removed them from the pot to darin the grease leaving a little to soften the veggies. Here is the other difference from my old neighbor, she would tkae the meat after if was brown and chop it by hand with a knife until it was extremely fine... she learned from her mother because she liked to have the meat stick to the spaghetti. OK, I am lazy so of course this was accomplished in the food processor as well. Added back to the sauteed veggies and continued from there. I have friends for dinner usually 3 nights a week since cooking is my therapy and I guess this week it will be Italian. I plan on using this for the sauce in lazzagna later this week...... THANKS AGAIN SHARLENE for an incredible recipe that I will be using over and over again. I have already printed it out to give to my friends... well maybe I will keep this one my secret and be a star!"
2585477,147978,2012-12-23,1,we didn't care for it and it most certainly is not egyptian by any stretch of the imagination.
148226,64913,2004-07-26,5,"FANTASTIC! I put this in in the morning at about 9.30 and left it while out at the beach all day.  I was a bit hesitant about having a dinner without pasta/rice but took the suggestion and had lovely French crusty bread smothered in the roasted soft garlic, alongside pieces of the chicken which had literally fallen off the bone and a green salad.  I did use alot more herbs than the recipe - just grabbed handfuls from the garden and stuffed them in the cavity along with a cut up lemon.  I also added, as another reviewer did, a half glass of white wine in addition to the stock.  This is definitely a keeper however, next time I will not use anywhere near as much liquid, probably just a dash of wine/stock as there was a HUGE amount of liquid which in fact I have frozen to use as a base for soup.  Thanks for this recipe!  It is great!"
2592291,10744,2014-07-17,0,"This is a great recipe. The flavors and textures worked out wonderfully. I need to experiment with portions to make it work in a 9x13 pan - too many in the family for a pie tin. I doubled the potatoes and sauce. This was a good amount of meat/veggies for the pan but was too much sauce. Next time I&#039;ll try 1 and 1/2 of the veggies/meat and the single recipe for sauce.&lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;In place of pie crust, I stole another food.com recipe. 2 cups bisquick. 1 cup milk. 2 eggs. Pour 1/3 on bottom of pan. Bake until slightly brown. Add pot pie ingredients and cover with bisquick mix. Bake for 30 minutes. That works out great and it&#039;s cheap and easy."
573325,428768,2010-06-26,5,"Mmmmm, what a creamy, thick and yummy dip!
I really enjoyed the sweetness of the roasted bell pepper in combination with the salty feta cheese. The chives added a lovely touch of flavour, too. YUM, I will definitely make this again!
I too left out the oil and roasted a bell pepper myself.
THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing yet another easy to make and sure to please recipe with us, Boomie!

300920,191143,2007-02-06,5,"This is a great recipe!
Thanks for sharing :)
I added a bit of green onion, too
and it looked just like the 
stuff they sell in the 
Korean restaurants! 
Thank you~!"
206191,31516,2005-04-12,4,"This was really delicious and so easy to make and clean up!  I made a few modifications though... I increased the water to 1 cup and used basmati rice.  I also used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  I added a couple shots of hot sauce and some garlic powder, salt and pepper and omitted the black beans.  I also cooked it for 1 hour and then topped it with the cheese and broiled it until golden.  Delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!"
498271,370851,2010-09-21,5,"This is a wonderful cake!  Easy to make, rich, moist and delicious.  I made half of the recipe with good results.  Loved this - thanks for posting the recipe!"
222139,299066,2008-09-22,5,What can we say but we loved this recipe! I made out up in no time at all.  I love it when you can sit back and just watch it cook.  Will be making again.
4470,93997,2004-06-30,5,"Wooyee you can be proud of this creation - loved every bite. I made it up in the cool of the AM right up to the point of the final heating- do not put sauce or sour cream on until just before serving. Let the tortilla get crispy I made individual servings.  They look like a double burrito - went over well.  I used whole wheat tortillas, dried sage (can't find fresh and mine isn't ready).  The brown rice, green peas are important to this dish but the zucchini would not be missed- upped the jalapeno and the ""Hot"" salsa a notch.  Thanks creative cook - loved your creation - This is a real stick to the ribs recipe.  I served it with a lettuce, sweet onion & tomato salad with fat free citrus Basil Dressing.  Great dinner 
.  These would be excellent for brunch, lunch or dinner."
39733,28414,2002-08-19,5,This was incredible. Yummy sauteed chicken and veggies in tomato sauce over pasta. Now that is my kind of meal. Had a great garlic flavor. Thanks for an easy delicious meal.
28170,38641,2003-04-13,5,"Excellent!  Easy to make. This is the only meatloaf I will make again.  Mosit and yummy,hot or cold.  I used picante sauce instead of ketchup, and ritz crackers instead of saltines.  "
341170,289503,2008-04-03,5,"DH was so thrilled that we were having anything named black forest! This was a huge hit at my house. I used cherry-vanilla ice cream, and only 1/2 the can of pie filling and it was such a decadent dessert! This will be eaten as often as we can sneak it into our diet!"
383504,255248,2010-04-27,4,"I'm giving this 4 stars ONLY because it lacked a little deeper flavor than I like.  I doctored it up a bit with sauteed onions and garlic, zucchini and spinach.  Seasoned it with oregano, salt, cracked pepper and squeezed the juice of one lemon just before serving to pep it up a little.  I give this 5 stars for prep.  I never would have thought to do chicken and orzo at the same time in the same pan.  What a breeze!!  So many variations can be used with this prep."
174096,418371,2011-10-19,5,Very good!  Loved the twist of using mozzerella cheese - it worked nicely.  I used the option of baking with sauce - used Recipe #370752 - and a little extra cheese on top.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing!  PAC Fall '11.
259154,113006,2006-01-03,3,This recipe was ok.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Flavor was good and the kids liked it. I was afraid the cheese would burn so I put a piece of aluminum foil over it.  Maybe next time I will use some spaghetti sauce and call it Chicken Parmesan. thanks for posting the recipe.  I appreciate the opportunity to try different things. 
306193,30484,2011-02-18,5,"Very good.  I used a ""Rump"" and it fell apart after hours in the crockpot."
140132,486496,2013-04-19,5,"Oh my goodness, this is rich and tasty.  I made these to go along with some soup for dinner and we loved them.  I really liked the filling....yummy.  Thank you for sharing with us, its a perfect addition for those cold soup nights."

324136,185781,2012-12-26,2,"Made for November 2012 Aussie swap.  I think I must have done something wrong making this; the topping was dry and powdery and the cake itself was fairly tasteless and a bit rubbery.  Think it wasn't sweet enough for our tastes.  Sorry, I really wanted to like it!"
2000940099,494259,2016-12-14,5,Awesome recipe. I signed up for a food.com account just so I could favourite this!
1803466610,149257,2014-12-13,5,"This is the best recipe I have come across, easy to follow and I love that you don&#039;t have to chill the dough. I had to add a little water, but this brought it altogether nicely and I love how it isn&#039;t at all sticky and easy to roll with minimum flour needed while rolling. The biscuits came out lovely and fluffy and kept their shape, I baked a few for longer so they were thin and crispy and a few that were a little thicker and baked for less time. I added a salted caramel topping and sprayed a few with edible gold and silver spray. Gorgeous!!! Thank You so much for sharing :)"

199848,51557,2012-09-05,5,Mmmmmm!  This is so good!   I love that it uses fresh spinach and not the slimy frozen spinach.   I used way less oil...maybe only 2 tbsps.  I also added a little garlic.  This stays nice and moist after baking.  Love it!   Thanx!
130819,333654,2008-12-09,5,"Love this broth - easy to make, not only healthy but wonderfully flavorful too. One of the first recipes made for the swap in order to have plenty of that lovely chicken broth I like to keep on hand in the fridge and freezer - ready to use for the recipes requiring broth or stock. Didn't have chicken legs - used an equal amount in chicken parts. Haven't done the oven thing for one long time - it really adds to the flavor. The aroma was such that I suspect the neighbours were sure we were having company! Thank you Syd,  your recipes are always winners at our house!"
513230,409753,2010-04-01,5,"Wonderful dough! I wanted a calzone today but wasn't in the mood to make dough with yeast. This was so easy, in the time I left the dough to rest I shredded my cheeses and prepped my toppings. I also added 1/2 tsp. of dried Italian seasoning to the dough. The end product turned out so delicious! I will be using this recipe often. Thanks for posting."
131021,100526,2009-03-13,4,I really liked this. We had it on pulled pork sandwiches and it was a great compliment. I might like to add a little onion and celery seed. I used half the mayo but kept the vinegar and sugar the same.
67656,308971,2008-06-24,4,"Looking for a simple way to prepare chicken thighs I came across this recipe and knew it would perfect for Sunday supper. After preparing the rub, I pulled back the skin a bit and placed some of the onion mix underneath so that it would permeate the meat.  Add the rest to sealed bag and let it chill for about 4 hours.  The chicken was really moist and had a subtly spicy flavor - one that folks with hot heads or tender tongues could enjoy. Served this with Recipe #309861 for a  wonderful taste of Africa.  Thanks WiGal!"
10404,80891,2005-03-02,4,"Hye Sue-

I made these ribs yesterday and thought they were quite good-a little on the sweet side though.  I did ""heat it up"" with about 1/4 cup red pepper flakes as we like heat on just about everything.  I will make these again using jalapeno jelly.  The meat was very tender and did not dry out-the recipe very easy to assemble.  Thanks for posting, Di"
523888,43150,2008-05-29,4,"I liked the idea of this a lot, but it just didn't work for me.  I have stainless steel pans and the coating stuck.  We weren't happy with the texture, but my dh said the sauce was great.  I would probably hunt down a nonstick before I make this again."
264230,133563,2006-08-16,5,"When I decided to try this recipe, I only had one can of chickpeas, so I adjusted the recipe to that. We have a huge rosemary bush, so I added more than the given amount, and it was a great taste. My mother and sister (not necessarily chickpea fans) enjoyed it and ate every drop of it. Decorated with a little rosemary, this soup looks and tastes quite special, considering how easy it is to make."
182010,136259,2006-06-12,5,I used this to spread on crostini that was topped with very rare shavings of roast beef and julienned pickled beets.  People loved them!  It also does freeze beautifully.
400708,413644,2010-03-06,4,"Made this for a very interesting, delicous and differant breakfast.  Love the combo of black beans and ham.  I followed the directions exactly and was very pleased with the outcome.  The only thing I might do a little differant next time is add a teaspoon of red chili peppers for a little extra zing.  But then that's just a personal thing as DH and I like some extra spice to our omellets.  Made for RSC #15, good luck on a great recipe."
1423762,302120,2009-10-23,5,"Excellent comfort food for a cool fall evening!  I substituted a can of french cut green beans for the peas, used dried thyme and put some shredded cheese on top of the potatoes.  It turned out delicious!"
502222,45896,2008-09-28,5,This is the best ham I have ever made.  I buy pear nectar in a can from a local Mexican Grocery Store to use.
768828,109467,2008-12-29,5,I loved this and such a pretty color.  Thanks
288146,121962,2012-08-18,5,"Delicious!  I used dill, thyme, and oregano and it was absolutely fantastic.  I will definitely be making this often.  Thanks for sharing!"
1017242,25313,2010-03-12,5,"The oven frying worked great! The fish cooked up nice and crispy, and my boyfriend who said he doesn't like catfish gobbled it up! This is more of a review for the method rather than the ingredients, since I didn't have any ""seasoned fish coating"" or Emeril's Essense, so I used cornmeal mixed with Penzey's Cajun Seasoning to coat the fish. I also didn't use any egg, since it looked like my fish was wet enough for the cornmeal to stick, but when I flipped the fish some of the breading came off, so maybe I should have used it after all. I don't like deep-frying at home, so now I'm glad I don't have to for nice breaded catfish."
102058,211574,2007-03-18,4,"Reviewed for RSC # 9. I canÃ¢â¬â¢t get commerical pastry in large sheets as ours come in boxes of  little squares, so I had to do the jig-saw puzzle style piece-together with what I had. This was quite tasty and certainly didnÃ¢â¬â¢t take long to put together. While I enjoyed it very much, it was missing that Ã¢â¬Åcertain-somethingÃ¢â¬? that would have made it a five star rating. Please see my rating system: a wonderful 4 stars for a tasty but not extra-ordinary Chicken Pie. Thanks!"
2000651872,69983,2015-11-08,5,This is not a good recipe for carb counters or diabectics.  What I did was I processed my own pumpkin pur&eacute;e and portioned the puree out for use throughout the next 6 months. Also I liked what some of the other reviewers did with the oil and flour tweaking and would also recommend increasing the baking time 10-15 minutes for home ovens. when the cake pulls away from the sides it&#039;s done.  I used 1.5 tsp of cinnamon and .5 tsp of pumpkin pie spice mix. With the wet/dry mixing method I found a hand mixer worked well. When making the frosting I cubed up cold butter and cream cheese and used my stand mixer with the paddle.attachment on hight speed while gradually dusting in the confectioners sugar with a touch of clear vanilla.  Great base recipe.
600985,50879,2010-11-16,5,"My husband loves lamb shanks, but I've never cooked them myself. This recipe was easy to follow and the results were fabulous! Thank you for a great recipe."
226867,123119,2017-08-05,4,"Very good potato salad, I do love the hint of lemon!"
125388,55309,2009-09-08,5,Great way to bring out the flavor of late-summer tomatoes.  I served these over a lettuce salad.
58104,373516,2009-06-02,5,"Fabulous! I added fresh cilantro. Served in the avocado shell stabilized with sour cream. Skipped the salt and pepper. Made the ZWT5 part of the Menu #28661. A must make! Gracia.
Salud!"
2001891769,343698,2017-12-26,3,"Tried this recipe âas isâ given the high amount of positive reviews and also because I wanted to try what a traditional German Black Forest cake is like and, unfortunately, I didnât like the filling. Wouldâve appreciated the icing being the filling instead so I donât know if this is because Iâm used to the âcommercializedâ version. I got drunk from one slice of this cake and got a headache. Didnât get any âoh wow, it tastes great from any of my guestsâ either other than they like how I decorated the cake. For making this cake for 5 hrs not including the prep time, I donât think Iâll ever make this version of Black Forest again."
303428,132796,2007-05-21,5,"Delicious!  I was very generous with the chili flakes so it was spicy, which I love.  I used this on grilled chicken and it was a great combo of heat and sweet.  Thanks!"
168462,35224,2010-09-29,5,"I doubled this as I was hoping my family would really like this and I was right. I did not pre cook my rice, just mixed it in and added extra water--about 1 can of water for a double batch. This is easy and so much less work than cabbage rolls. Thanks for the recipe."
844554,486450,2012-09-11,5,"Tell your sister-in-law ""KUDOS!"" It is an amazing marinade and one I'll use over and over again! It was wonderful on my pork chop. I have some stew meat to use up so I'm gonna throw it in the crockpot with this delicious recipe and see how it goes. YUM! Made for Zaar's New Kids on the Block tag game 2012."
213139,317235,2009-07-23,5,"Yummy, yummy, yummy......Did I say this was yummy???  I eat oatmeal just about every morning for breakfast and it's nice to have something different.  I've never put applesauce in my oatmeal so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor the applesauce added.  Thanks for posting this.  Made for Zaar Cookbooks Tag."
61660,56533,2003-05-20,3,"This was a very easy recipe to make, but I thought the seasonings overpowered everything else.  I would maybe add the oregano and rosemary to taste.  I added more orzo to even it out a little.  I did eat a little piece of the cooked marinated chicken before mixing everything together and that was really good.  "
167236,303671,2009-05-21,5,"Made for ZWT5, Groovy Gastronomes. Photos are in Cooking Photos Forum (http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?p=4540988#4540988).

As Brooke said, it doesn't get much easier or thriftier ... and yes, tastes wonderful. I made two versions, one with commercial salsa (Newman's Own) and one with a ZWT5 salsa recipe. Most commercial salsas are cooked as part of the bottling process, so the salsa chunks are a bit soft, compared to the raw ingredient salsas (a grilled vegetable salsa would be intermediate in texture). By using different salsas or by adding chile peppers, you can alter the texture and the heat of this recipe any way you like.

I pureed about 1/3 of the drained black beans to provide some adhesion without adding a lot of liquid.

Great recipe, Brooke, thanks for posting!"
362919,168628,2008-09-23,5,"My first time using yeast to make bread/rolls from scratch. I think I did pretty well, I used the ABM instructions and made hamburger rolls. I probably wouldn't use them for that purpose again, but would make some smaller dinner rolls out of it. Five stars because even tho I'm sure I messed up a little, they still turned out and tasted good lol. I liked that they were slightly sweet, thanks for posting!"
296434,143504,2006-09-03,5,"A fantastic recipe.  I ommited the capers and cooked it slowly for about three hours.  Just what I was looking for, the whole family loved it, thank you."
326787,224999,2007-09-30,5,"Wonderful cake, love the moist flavor. This make a lot and would be great for a crowd of people or to take to work and share. Extremely moist."
286566,285681,2008-10-07,5,"Took to the DS's recreation group were they were quickly gobbled up and thoroughly enjoyed.  Thank you Redsie, made for Photo Tag."
207375,67695,2006-04-26,5,"This was great!!!  The only thing I did diffrently was that I wrapped my potatoes individually with foil and used salt, pepper, garlic powder, and italian seasoning.  Excellent, creamy potatoes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
768025,358911,2009-03-20,0,"I prepared this tonight doing exactly as the recipe says,
oh my Goodness what this every so good. even my picky 17 year old stepson said he would rate this 8 stars if he could , this is sure to be a keeper in our home 
thank you soo much Sherry for the Great Recipe.
Thumbs up to you !!!!"
55578,14701,2011-04-24,5,I got really nervous when it was supposed to be done and there was tons of milk left.  I boiled the pan until it thickened up and everything was good.  Tx for the recipe.
333581,226541,2007-07-19,4,"I thought this was good, but I messed it up somewhere. To me it didn't taste like Macaroni Grill's, but it wasn't bad. The sauce wasn't quite right. I tried to add a bit more wine, but that made it too sweet. So maybe next time I'll use some extra chicken sauce instead on wine. Thanks for the recipe, I'll just have to tweak it a bit."
223854,66325,2008-08-17,5,"Quick, easy and very delicious salad! I used this as a side dish and it was wonderful. I have made this recipe twice and would make it again because we all enjoyed it. The directions were so easy to follow and the recipe was very yummy.  Thank you Kozmic Blues"
1225636,18597,2010-03-28,5,"This came out well, despite my improvising on a few things. I used a cup of celery and carrots mixed. I didn't have chicken broth, so I used 4 cups of water with 4 tsp chicken bouillon. I also didn't have any onion, so I used about 1-1 & 1/2 tsp of onion powder. Also didn't have thyme or basil, so I added about a tsp of garlic powder (I love garlic though) for extra flavor. I cooked it on the stove for about 15-20 minutes. It was yummy, and just needed a little salt and pepper. The veggies came out nice and soft, which is a plus for me. I can't wait to make this as is, as I'm sure it'll be even better."
16551,17080,2002-01-18,5,"This was great!  Tastes like ""regular"" lasagna w/out the guilt. I used fat free cottage cheese instead of ricotta. The metric conversations were a little tedious. Will make it again, soon."
64583,38433,2004-07-20,5,"This is the only way I make French toast now.  I use Pepperidge Farm breads - the cinnamon raisin, French vanilla, and brown sugar cinnamon.  I usually make 4 loaves at a time so that I can freeze the leftovers - my kids love having them for breakfast and they freeze beautifully.  "
1701790,136546,2010-10-10,5,"YUM!!  I haven't had a decent schnitzel for a very long time.  I used to buy them from the supermarket where I used to live, but haven't found any in the UK.  So I thought I would make my own.  I used veal instead of pork, made the first layer of seasoned flour, and used soft breadcrumbs rather than dried.  Pounding the meat is also a good idea to keep the cooking time short and the schnitzels tender.  I will be doing this again, and again, and again!!  Thanks"
2823856,376649,2013-05-14,5,I love Killer Shrimp! Thank you very much for the recipe. Never imagined I would able to make it myself. You hit the bullseye with this recipe. I used celery salt. The dish is delicious!!! Thank you again.
52543,156085,2006-02-22,5,"A really delicious fresh salsa with a flavour blending that is perfect for a crowd! Its not too hot ... no ingredient overpowers the others. Its also fun ""assembling"" your own appetizers while sipping on a glass of wine & chatting with friends. Thanx Toolie!  "
360437,32204,2008-05-12,5,Great brownies and simple to make! I used coconut flavoring instead of the vanilla and coconut for the mix-in. Thanks!
2000187063,101699,2015-05-05,4,"This is a good recipe. Being from the Pacific N.W. Clams are rather easy to come by. I added about 2x the amount, some fresh salmon, and  6 slices of thick cut bacon (diced) to it. Amazing recipe to add and make changes to easily."
101732,282849,2009-04-25,3,This was OK but the ketchup kept sliding around and it wasn't very appealing. I love ketchup on my scrambled eggs so I thought this would be good. It's not the same. Sorry.
481092,256914,2007-12-25,4,"These were good.  We enjoy a moister biscuit, just personal preference.  Thanks for posting.  Did love the butter/garlic brushed on top and will use this on other bread recipes."
1801901544,170114,2014-01-27,5,"This is excellent soup!  I made a few small changes to the recipe.  I added 2 Tbsp. tomato paste and 1 tsp. of Harissa paste.  This added a nice depth of flavour and a little heat.  When the soup was done, I processed half in my blender then added it back into the pot.  It thickened the soup and melded the flavours.  My son, the vegetarian, and my husbandm the carnivore, both loved the soup and it will definitely make a regular appearance on our table.  Next time I will double or triple the recipe and put several containers in my freezer."
56680,57542,2005-07-20,5,Very easy to follow and the smell is wonderful!  Thanks for a great keeper.
163687,197976,2012-03-30,4,I loved this and will definitely make again.
664225,44133,2008-10-07,3,"We had mom and dad coming over for chicken on the grill, and I wanted a pasta salad to go with it.  From all the good reviews I thought this one would be good to try.  I used garlic powder instead of the garlic salt, where I was already using celery salt.  With the salty meat and cheeses, I didn't want to overpower it, so it didn't taste good.  I will make again sometime, but will probably use a low sodium ham in it, or none at all for that matter!  Also, I will leave out the horseradish, as I'm not crazy about it in this dish.  Thank you!"
792051,174619,2009-02-08,5,"Instead of ranch style beans, I used a can of pinto beans (which I drained first). Also, we added more spice to taste (chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder) and some shakes of Worcestershire. It was pretty good for being such a basic, last-minute type dinner for us!"
955335,137226,2008-09-13,5,"I tried this recipe 2 years ago and made it for guests. I always get asked to make it. I had to come back on here and search for 30min to find it,"
239758,347795,2010-05-24,5,"Excellent beef curry, and a wonderful addition to an Indian banquet. I made this with rump steak, so it was tender within 40 minutes. Because my lid wasn't very tight-fitting, I was almost out of liquid by then, so I added a bit extra coconut milk. I have a big crop of fresh Thai hot chillies, so used those in place of the chilli powder. Thanks for posting."
121690,38268,2005-12-11,5,"I made this awhile back but forgot to review them. The big treat here is the horseradish. I left off the cheese when I made it and didn't miss it, but I'm sure they'd be great with the cheese, too."
179133,311482,2011-10-22,5,"I was afraid the seasoning salt would make this too salty so I used salt-free garlic & herb seasoning. Otherwise followed the recipe, reducing everything slightly since I only had about 1/3 cup sour cream. Served with mini bell peppers, carrots, and potato chips. Thanks for sharing!"
2001273529,14979,2016-11-28,5,"I used date sugar instead of white sugar and 2 TBS of stevia; it was perfect!! Not too sweet. I had to refrigerate for 4 hours for it to become stiff enough to slice I also used 2 cups of mile and 1 cup of heavy whipping cream, it was rich but not overpowering and creamy! we used whole milk, grass fed and low pasturized and I really think that's why it was soooooo good!!! Ive made banana pudding and banana cream pie before with just regular whole milk and the taste is no where near as good as it was with the quality milk!"
869184,48365,2010-10-24,5,"Amazing!!! I followed Raichka's (June 26 2010) recommendation and halved the butter, used one egg and added 1/2 cup apple sauce. I also omitted the nuts - family preference. These changes reduced the calories to 185 cal per serving. The flavour and texture was just fantastic and I am sure this loaf won't survive long. I will be making this lots! Made for your Cook A Thon (PS - the kids   friends just came asking for seconds.....)"
342784,302120,2011-03-17,5,"Excellent main dish for our St. Patrick's Day dinner!  We got beef stock instead of chicken stock since the recipe was listed simply as ""stock.""  We didn't realize that it was supposed to be chicken stock until working through the instructions.  The final gravy was a little weak in flavor which may have been caused by this substitution.  We had to add dashida soup stock to boost the flavor a bit.  Make sure that you remember to chop the thyme.  I forgot to chop our and consequently my family was finding little ""sticks"" periodically in their food.  Whoops!"
679953,167662,2012-12-27,5,"My intention was to make this with both oreserves, but after starting this I realized I just had strawberry preserves, so that is what I did, but I doubled the amount to make up for the blueberry preserves.  Ending result was a very nice dessert for us.  One of the easiest recipes to prepare for, not including the tortilla strips, but that was pretty easy too.  I did make wraps out of these.  The preserve cream cheese mixture was a nice combination, and was enjoyed tonight during the game.  Made for New Zaar Tag."
165803,20785,2004-10-05,5,This recipe was great. I couldn't believe how simple it was either. 
66983,59311,2005-02-28,5,I'm putting this in the 20* file!  I loved this sauce on our porkchops!  I made sure not to double dip while I basted and served the extra sauce on the side for our dipping pleasure!  Thanks Dancer!
209747,218464,2008-08-14,5,"This was really great! Simple and tasty! I made this to keep on hand when I had tons of people in and out of my house for dd's wedding! It was so nice to just tell them- ""Help yourself to whatever is in the fridge when you are hungry"" This was simple so it appealed to everyone which was great. Like a tuna salad sandwich on pasta!

345845,16213,2008-12-27,5,OMG! These were amazing! I actually ended up placing 2 slices of bacon instead of the suggested ham in each one of these and I had to seriously FORCE myself to stop eating them before everyone came over. They were soooooo good!!!
2002196985,178370,2018-06-24,5,"I made these just now, and they turned out perfectly. They have nice, raised tops and just the right amount of sweetness. I frosted them with homemade buttercream frosting that took me all of 2 minutes to make. Husband loves them, and I'm pretty impressed myself. I'm not a professional baker, so I don't have a piping bag or anything like that, but they turned out great (for an amateur/casual hobbyist)."
43505,36252,2005-02-14,4,"This was yummy!  I added a can of cream of broccoli soup as well, and used crumbled saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs.  We'll make this again, thanks!"

This is the simplest, easiest, most straightforward and foolproof recipe I've ever used.

But reading the reviews bolstered my resolve and I've found the solution to my pork roast woes. Would that all basic &quot;prep&quot; solutions this simple!"

206747,201214,2008-09-02,5,"YUM !!  Fried these outside in a Frydaddy deep fryer, and they browned and rolled so easily ! Had jumbo double-yolk eggs, so just used 3. Was perfect ! Made 1/2 with mixture of sugar and cinnamon, rolled hot out of fryer.  The other 1/2 dusted with confectioner's sugar, after cooling.
 Took them to a Labor Day BD party, and they were quickly scarfed up, as word spread.  First had these by 84 yo mom of friend, (REAL Italian lady), and knew we had found a new love!  Thanks, JackieMarie."

396078,482586,2013-03-23,4,"I am always excited to try new maple recipes because I am a lover of real maple syrup.  How coincidental that I came across this recipe, as it just happens to be peak maple-tapping season in the Northeastern USA.  This cake is light and fluffy with delicate ginger flavor, moist fruit and topped with a subtle maple glaze.  I actually substituted apples for the pears, since my hubby unwittingly served the pears I was saving to our youngsters for breakfast today.  :)  Being a maple-lover, I would have liked this cake to have a stronger maple flavor.  The glaze has a nice maple flavor and makes the cake glisten like a precious gem, but I&#039;d like a little stronger maple flavor in the cake itself.  I also found myself wanting a little more moisture with the cake, so I should have heeded your advice and served it with ice cream.  The next time I bake this cake (using pears!), I&#039;ll serve it with maple-walnut ice cream or maple whipped cream.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Baby Kato!  It was scrumptious!"
2002203340,257276,2018-06-30,5,Always perfect and never have leftovers - they scrape the crock pot for every last spoonful. Iâve been making it for at least 5 years - wonderful.
296809,368990,2012-07-25,5,"Made for ZWT-8 (mostly as written), I served this sauce atop broccoli florets to dress-up a dinner collection of leftovers. I did omit the salt as DH is salt-restricted, used parsley vs dill & added a healthy shot of Tobasco (a pers pref in the classic butter version). Like most reviewers, I esp like using Hollandaise on veggies (usually broccoli) & Eggs Benedict, but I've never been able to avoid using it in an excess amt (my MORE IS BETTER principle). This yogurt-based sauce allows my excess to be nearly guilt-free & it tastes great too. I'm very happy I found your recipe. Thx for sharing it w/us. :-)"
443871,148225,2010-11-25,5,I tried this brine recipe this year and it turned out great. I only used half of the brine because I was only cooking an 8 # turkey. I'm holding on to the other gallon for the next time I cook a whole chicken.
241882,48346,2008-02-19,5,"This was great. I substituted some of the sugar for Splenda just to cut down on the sugar.
I couldn't believe how good it was."
206354,48835,2007-08-03,5,"Excellent bulk cooking recipe!  LOVE that it is tasty, but not with overpowering flavors.  I made extra and was able to freeze so much for the freezer.  We're definitely going to try the accompanying recipes.  Thanks for this -- it was just what I needed!"
84024,5368,2014-01-27,3,I&#039;ve had better.  It was ok everyone ate some. My son asked if he could add something to it and put in potatoes and said that made it better.  I probably won&#039;t make this again.  Sorry
339260,99103,2007-07-23,4,"Very good and easy Split Pea Soup recipe.  I had planned to make this in the crock pot tomorrow, but I had a craving for the soup tonight and didn't have enough time to use the crock pot.  I cooked the soup on the stove letting it come to a boil for about 20 minutes and then I let it simmer for about 30 minutes.  I had also added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of ham soup base to the hot water and added an extra cup of water to the soup when I turned it down to a simmer.  Thanks for the great recipe, Chelie."
87236,11018,2006-08-02,0,"I just found this recipe at another source, and the measurements and amounts are identical to this recipe, EXCEPT that the amount stated for the flour is 2 1/2 cups, NOT the amount listed here. "
461834,66241,2007-10-28,5,"This were delicious!!  Made them for today's Sunday breakfast along with sausage and eggs.  The texture is great and the consistency is right, in that it is not too thick or thin.  I started out cooking them at 350 on griddle but had to up it to about 375, probably just my old griddle.
Made for potluck tag!!!  Thanks Nimz for another great recipe!!"
1594409,65643,2010-07-19,5,"This was the first thing I ever cooked (besides grilled cheese and kraft dinner haha) and it turned out really well! I undercooked the potatoes a bit but thats my fault :) The taste was awesome, the cheddar cheese and green onions really went nicely with the potatoes. Thanks for a great recipe even a true beginner can do!"
1597357,70630,2011-10-24,3,"Well, I hate to dissent but...these are just soooo sweet. I was a little taken aback. I ate half a sandwich and wrapped up the rest for lunch tomorrow. I am considering how to cut the sweetness without cutting ingredients because they actually go very well together. The cream cheese/marmalade/pecan mix is sooo delish. I will definitely be offering that Christmas morning with bagels...that makes me think of ham or bacon-yes, I think I will add bacon to my other half of sandwich and see if that changes things enough."
430471,216045,2007-07-25,5,This was great. I used milk chocolate chips and pecans. I also used applesauce instead of oil. Great taste and really easy to put together.
1584092,25962,2011-10-13,5,"Excellent, so quick and easy to make!"
345594,178736,2006-09-12,4,"I thought this turned out really well, but I had to add about 2 extra cups of coconut milk because the pearls hadn't cooked completely and it was beginning to dry out too much and stick.  Other than that, it was delicious, easy and my husband loves it!"
2002280247,159894,2018-09-21,5,It's all gone. No time for a picture.
570804,317246,2010-06-09,4,Finally got around to making this bread (1/2 quantity). Always follow a recipe exactly as written before rating. Love lemon and cranberries but felt that it needed 1/2 cup butter rather than 1/3. Maybe we like a richer taste. Next time (and there definitely will be a next time) I will make this change. A suggestion re using lemon rind. You get a more potent lemon taste if the rind is grated into the sugar and rubber together with your fingers. Thanks for posting.P.S. with the changes mentioned above they are now better than our Tim Hortons (so agree with other reviewer!!!!)
255976,2674,2005-10-28,5,This is first bread recipe I tried.  I made rolls (14 in all) in round pans and they turned out awesome.  I will definitely use this recipe again. Much less involved than most bread recipes
80353,172295,2014-08-21,5,"Really good and different salad with flavour popping out at you from all over the place - what with the salami, pepperoncini, olives, etc.  Every mouthful was slightly different and you just kept want to eat more and more!  Thanks."
1216499,67256,2009-05-13,5,"I love this cake! However, I don't love the frosting.  I made this cake twice, once with the original cream cheese frosting recipe and the other with buttercream.  It's way better with butter cream!  I did 1 stick butter, 4 cups powdered sugar, milk, 1 tsp. vanilla.  I also thought the first cake was too thick for the ratio of frosting.  So, I prefer to do this in a sheet cake pan.  Overall, great cake (with the buttercream frosting).  I get tons of compliments!"
305531,172625,2006-08-14,5,"This was a good, dense, banana bread.  I marinated the bananas for 3 days just barely covered in the rum.  We couldn't 'taste' the rum per say, but it had a nice flavor."
107583,113456,2006-12-10,5,"These were wonderful.  I had never mashed red potatoes before, and sure will from now on, since russets are not good for diabetics, and waxy potatoes are better!  Thanks for posting!"
1885935,61278,2011-04-17,5,"This recipe is so delicious, easy and versatile! A wonderful balance of sweet and tart. Besides using it as a filling for cakes I make Lemon Poppy Seed Muffins (#100943), pour 1/2 the batter in, spoon a tsp. of lemon curd in centre and top with remaining 1/2 of batter. My family loves the moist little surprise centre. I am dying to try the orange version.Thanks so much Rita for a great recipe."
831580,43693,2009-03-01,4,"I love sausages in general, and am one of those people who puts ketchup on hot dogs, but I don't like many curry dishes. I grilled the bratwurst (on a tabletop grill sprayed with ""vegetable oil cooking spray""), and used ""hoagies"" for the rolls. For the ketchup I measured 1/2 cup liquid measure. The resulting sandwiches were pretty tasty, but I would've enjoyed them even more without the curry powder. Still, I may try this again, if I have a spicy curry powder on hand (I think the one I used was pretty mild), since I love spicy food too."
174706,114296,2005-06-25,5,"This was excellent and so easy!  I liked the flavor alot.  I was tempted to use the cream of potato and cream of chicken, since I had that on hand, but used the cream of celery soup and really enjoyed it.  Thanks for a great recipe - clearly a keeper in my house!"
811994,151829,2009-02-05,5,Excellent taste and very easy to make. I did not use the Tyme as I'm not a big fan of it.  I cut the breast into strips and sauteed in garlic and oil.  I also used one extra TBS honey in the sauce and next time may add a little corn starch to make a thicker glaze.
1321269,73166,2009-07-11,3,"This recipe is way too sweet.  I added a second can of diced tomatoes to cut the sweetness... that helped a bit, but I was still disappointed.  Otherwise great depth of flavor.  I will definitely try it again, but will start with 1/8 cup of brown sugar."
61660,175266,2009-06-11,5,We enjoyed these very much.   I only had one shallot so I used some minced garlic as well.  I enjoyed the vinegar flavor.  Made for Las Mistico Magicos Sirenas - ZWT5.
464080,201058,2010-09-18,5,"Very nice zucchini!  The flavor was very natural which I liked.  I grilled them on medium on my neighbor's grill and it took almost 25 minutes for them to get done.  I had small zucchini, so we used 2 - I cut them in half and then in half again making 8 nice sized chunks.  I used fresh oregano and dried dill and doubled the amt asking for in the recipe (most of it fell off during grilling, but that's OK).  I am going to use the leftovers in some lasagna next week."
2002172841,294620,2018-06-02,5,"My favorite cole slaw recipe, although I cut the sugar by at least half. I love a creamy, simple slaw that isn't too sweet."
732581,9370,2008-09-15,5,"One of the first things I learned to make as a burgeoning cook when I was little!  I still love these as the perfect nibble comfort food.  I almost always add a little vanilla extract before I mix the chocolate mixture in, but otherwise the recipe is a dead on of what I make. The easiest way is to layer chex, then chocolate, chex, chocolate, etc, then mix.  It just assures less mixing, and less breaking of chex.  Wonderful and Tasty!!"
57256,92599,2004-08-26,5,"Ok , I had to wait for DH to go out of town to make this (insert embarassed face here). Although this is true comfort food for me , I don't think he would eat it . TOO BAD FOR HIM !!! LOL This is very good ! I made it for myself and now have the leftovers hidden deep in the freezer , waiting for the next time he is out of town ! I think this is a great dish for those nights when you must take the kids to ball or soccer practice . This would also be great sereved for a kids birthday or slumber party too ! I LOVED IT !!!"
136511,149627,2010-04-10,3,"DH and I thought this dish was just okay.  It was quick and easy to make, however, we thought it tasted a bit bland and DH deemed it visually unappealing.  I'm sorry we didn't care for it, but appreciate you posting the recipe for us to try!"
222564,429877,2016-01-31,5,"Absolutely to die for! Looks very tempting too, with the Nutella swirl."
17803,35217,2003-01-09,4,"I did not make the sauce but will try it another time.  I used 93% ground beef and feel I could have cut the amount of breadcrumbs in half. I will try this on the grill when the weather warms up.
 "
2050963,107786,2011-11-01,0,"Wow, this was very easy to make.  I am not a cook, but now that I made these, everyone wants me to make them again.  Maybe I am a cook afterall.  This receipe was easy to follow, I couldnt find the smokey salt, but used liquid smoke and brushed it on.  Turned out great.  Thank You so much Beth for posting this.  Awesome, try this! !"
839452,71933,2009-01-17,5,"I loved the crispy crust and the flavor from the kosher salt.  We topped ours with sour cream and lots of butter (I know, shame shame on us!) and they were enjoyed with our broiled sirloin steaks.  Thank you!"
618030,135918,2009-06-01,5,Really YUM. I have almost made this with worcester sauce when I had run out of soya sauce and it was even better! Have made it this way ever since.
513230,31504,2011-02-09,5,"Wow! I am surprised at how good the end result for this recipe is. I have to say though, I was one of those people who had trouble with sticky dough. I kept thinking to myself, ""The end result better be worth all this trouble!"" and I'm going to tell you, it sure is! I didn't get time to make this yesterday so I made it this morning and left it in the fridge for a few hours and then stuck it in the freezer for about an hour before I used it. I also chilled a piece of wax paper to roll out the dough between, needless to say - it still got sticky real fast and I used this dough straight out of the freezer. I didn't add any extra flour while rolling it out - so I just may try a sprinkle of flour between wax paper next time. I used this to make Apple Strudel, it was buttery, flaky, delicious. I am definitely making this again - thanks for sharing!"
179133,296274,2011-05-19,5,"Delicious, quick, easy - what more can you ask for? :) I halved the recipe (and quartered the honey glaze, which was plenty). I was unsure about the short broil time, but it turned out perfect. Served with salad and baked beans for an excellent weeknight meal. Thanks for sharing!"
28455,25952,2002-10-19,5,"I can't begine to say how good this is, this is probably the most elegant recipe I have ever made. I am planning on serving this on Christmas Eve, to my inlaws and I can't wait for them to taste it. I followed the recipe exactly, it is exceptional! "
138365,73825,2011-07-05,5,I made this for a Family gathering over the 4th of July.  Rave reviews form EVERYONE!! And many requests for the recipe. You will not be disappointed if you make this!
242484,120610,2009-06-30,5,My entire family enjoyed this applesauce! I used a variety of apples and it came out great!
679953,153691,2013-05-09,4,"Good dinner,  as we all enjoyed these nice enchiladas,though we did not like like the celery in these, hence the 4 stars.  Other than that they were good,  and did make for a good dinner.  The chiles did take the cake with these, and loved the idea of pork in these rather than beef, it was nice to have pork for a change, since we usually prefer beef.   Nice and filling too.  Made for PRMR Tag."
872588,295531,2008-06-25,5,"My husband is from mexico, I made this cake to surpprise him on father's day.  He absolutely loved it.  Everyone did."
222139,131163,2007-10-01,5,"Loved this Pizza! You do not get this type of pizza at a pizza place.
  We were not sure if we would like pineapple on our pizze so we chose to only put half on.  We will be putting pineapple on the whole pizza the next time."
1211187,89207,2009-10-12,0,"This was great!  I used this on the rainbow cupcakes for an event at my son's school, and all the 1st/2nd graders loved it!  My family loved it as well.  Very easy to make - I like the additional directions for making the frosting more or less rich.  This is definitely a keeper!"
258285,247999,2007-10-12,4,"Review my Recipe Tag 2007 ~ Haven't had clam sauce in a while and this fit the bill.  Added the clam juice when indicated, but did not add the clams themselves until the very end, just to heat them through.  I know from personal experience that you should not cook canned clams for very long as they will toughen and become chewy, especially since they are already cooked.  Thanks Maito!"
1102578,369846,2011-12-29,3,"Followed recipe exactly.  Flavor was good, but sauce was very, very thin and runny.  Might try again using less water, maybe 3 or 4 cups total.  Thanks!"
1630307,98366,2010-07-06,4,Mine did not set. I have always used pectin and was curious about this recipe. It is a delicious sauce. Had it on waffles the other morning. Yum! Maybe a tad too sweet for my taste.
37688,67884,2006-09-21,5,"We had this for dinner tonight and both DH and I found it delicious and full of flavour. I also added two tablespoons of uncooked rice to the mixture but apart from that didn't change a thing, just served it over steamed rice.  DH even asked if he take the leftovers to work the next day for lunch."
352271,78814,2007-11-24,5,"Made using leftovers, and was it ever good!  Thanks."
171084,31114,2008-08-10,5,"Super easy, common ingredients and excellent taste makes for one great recipe!! DGD & I made cupcakes today and frosted them this wonderful creation.  Grandpa & DGD both gave this thumbs up and to quote the little expert ""This is excellent stuff!!"".  The frosting sets up beautifully on cupcakes  and with or without sprinkles, it's just the right compliment to any cupcake.  Thanks MizzNezz for another great recipe!"
916394,79308,2011-03-20,5,"This was even better than the seasoning packets you can buy at the store! I did make some changes: I used half the meat at my husbands request, I used 3 tblsp of chili powder, 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper for some zing, I doubled the rest of the seasonings except the salt, and found it seasoned perfectly. I added a can of pinto beans, didn't use any green pepper, and instead of the tomato paste and water, I added a can of tomato sauce because it was what I had. the consistency and flavor were right on!  Next time I think I'd use black beans and corn for a more southwestern style. Thanks for sharing!"
114027,70493,2010-10-30,5,"Wow, could not have been any easier to make! I had some homemade cookie dough in the fridge so I used that and it worked perfectly. I thought it was a very sweet dessert, so a small amount is all I needed :) Made for Think Pink 2010."
125388,268004,2010-04-09,4,"This was good, and gives a lot of flavor for how easy it is to mix up with leftover potatoes and poultry (I used chicken instead of turkey).  I thought it was a little thin; maybe it would have been better with 3 cups of chicken broth instead of 4.  I also added some chopped celery with the other vegetables."
224212,204570,2007-03-19,5,tops. but i like to cut the crust off.
1539557,212129,2012-02-05,5,This recipe is awesome! Highly recommended.
140806,64138,2005-11-09,4,"This was quite easy, but the end result was just a little mushy. I used four cheese ravioli and reduced the red peppers slightly. This is a great recipe for busy families."
209318,90652,2005-05-21,4,"This was SOO good.  My friends and I ate ALL of it while watching the new OC.  I used peanuts and kind of felt theyjust got in the way; it was hard to get them to mix evenly and they kind of hogged the coating.  Also, it's hard to coat the popcorn easily.  Regardless it is quite tasty.  And don't be put off by the vinegar - the stuff smells rotten when you're cooking it, but it is sweet, I promise!  ALSO, I cooked it over medium for a long time (at least 10 minutes) and got sick of waiting and turned it up to high, that cooked it right quick and in a hurry!"
73769,65779,2003-11-28,5,This spinach salad was fantastic. The dressing was absolutely delicious. The only change I made was that I used fresh bean sprouts since I could not find the canned. This is definately a keeper. Thanks Kree for a great recipe.
201581,106909,2011-03-27,5,Great soul-warming soup on a cold wintery day. So easy to make in a crock for a day with other things to attend to. I used my stick blender to smooth it up a little but I like it chunky. Thanks for sharing a great and easy recipe. Made for Pick A Chef Spring 2011.
67728,241719,2010-05-26,5,"I'm not sure why, but I've been on a seasoned nut kick since PAC, so these were a perfect choice for me to make. These have such a lovely flavor! I was kind of expecting the seasoning to be a bit stronger than it was, so later on I might try a couple more batches with some tweaks (increased spice mix, different curry powder, maybe a bit of hot pepper).  They're definitely addictive little suckers, that's for sure! :) Thanks for posting! Made for The Queens of Quisine for ZWT 6"
157425,203596,2009-01-11,5,I had 3 large chicken breasts in the refrigerator that I used for this recipe instead of the 8 chicken pieces. The apple butter I used was sweeter than I had hoped it would be but the sauce still had a great flavor. Instead of rice or noodles I served with mashed potatoes but brown rice would be very nice with this chicken. Would like to try this again using a tarter apple butter and boneless chicken breast. Thank you TraceyMae! Made and reviewed for the Australia/New Zealand Forum's Recipe Swap #24.
145352,110937,2006-06-25,5,Very good and easy. I let mine marinade all day!
22015,19098,2003-12-03,5,This was great - especially after eating turkey for so many days!  Thanks for the change of pace....even my picky DD loved it so you know it's a kid lover recipe!
383609,129926,2016-05-02,5,"I was a little hesitant to try this recipe because it sounded bland. I am so glad that I did make it, because it is delicious! I made as stated except for a few changes; I used corn instead of flour tortillas - personal preference - cheddar cheese because that is what I had; my can of chopped chili's was 7 ounces instead of 4 ounces. I also put about 1 teaspoon of softened cream cheese inside each enchilada. I do that with hamburgers also, it seems to add a richness, but no one even knows it is there! It is the delicious sauce that really makes these enchiladas a stand-out!"
57695,116502,2005-09-22,5,Yum just how i make banana's foster!! i did add some vanilla and butter flavorings. I had some tropical ice cream (coconut/passion fruit) with it and sooo good!
114287,41992,2009-07-23,5,"Three words... NOM, NOM, NOM"
1803277338,263734,2014-10-28,0,"I make this for my toddler daily now and he often requests it if I forget! I don&#039;t typically use artificial sweetener of any kind as there is plenty in the yogurt and fruit, although occasionally I&#039;ll throw in a few dark chocolate chips for a treat. I use Greek yogurt instead of regular for 4x the protein. Its crazy how much more protein is in Greek yogurt vs. regular!"
1156619,12677,2009-02-24,5,"I made this last night and it was incredible.  I altered it a little, I used 2lbs of ground turkey and added 1 can of salsa, reduced milk to 1/8 cup.  seeing other reviews, I made sure I squeezed all the liquid out of the spinach.  Family Raved!!"
107135,262661,2010-06-21,5,"really good .didnt need sugar  got the seeds everywhere just like you told me not to . i have a brain freeze now , but im not stopping drinking  zaar tour 6"
482376,330929,2014-03-15,5,"Fabulous soup. I love the variety of veggies and seasoned chicken. I have a cold right now and this really hits the spot. The soup is flavorful, hearty and healthy. Thank you so much for this winner. I&#039;m putting into my best-of-the-best file! Note: next time, to adjust to my personal preferences: I will increase the amts of beans, mushrooms and orzo, omit the apple and possibly omit the spinach."
171084,111904,2008-09-26,5,Very quick and easy recipe to make - grandgirls loved this.  Not a lot of fru-fru ingredients makes this a great recipe for kids! Worked great for supper after long day at work too!  Made for PAC Fall '08.
855206,310275,2008-11-30,0,i can't find soy cream anywhere. :(
2002009943,33150,2018-02-23,2,"I made this cake yesterday. After reading the reviews I was expecting an outstanding cake, but I am disappointed. The cake is dry and doesn't have a rich buttery flavor. I have had better pound cakes made with a boxed mix and instant pudding. I don't recommend this recipe"
1108749,359970,2009-05-19,5,"My sister and I made these for lunch for our 1,2,and3 year olds.  We did omit the pepperoni and the italian seasoning as I didn't have any, but the tomatoes and mozzarella (I also added some very finely chopped onion) were very tasty.  We really liked these, and they are easy and versitile.  Thank you so much for the recipe."
546010,259007,2008-03-02,5,"Simply wonderful! I loved the hint of heat from the cayene pepper. I added a bit more milk and broth as the soup thickened up. If my husband doesn't take the leftovers to work, I'll post a photo! Thanks a bunch for posting this fantastic recipe, Bobo!"
1329632,86593,2012-12-28,0,I made this for a potluck at work today and everyone loved it.  I was concerned about making to much but it was such a hit I should have made a larger batch.  Several made a point to let me know how much they liked it!  Very attractive and flavorful dish!
710809,70301,2008-12-29,0,"Thanks, I always use mayo and I am happy to have a recipe that seems much healthier."
182358,198914,2007-02-03,5,"Excellent and so easy!  I did make two slight changes:  First, I used sugar- & fat-free pudding mix with fat-free half-and-half to make the pudding.... but then cheated with real whipped cream.  The result is a very satisfying dessert that makes you feel pampered... without a ton of effort up front.  This will be made again and again!"
71219,35267,2004-01-10,5,Totally wonderful! Thank you. Actually I used them for a Pampered Chef recipe in place of Pillsbury refrigerated crescents. I could have gotten away with half the recipe.
143692,53508,2009-07-14,5,"This is a new staple at our house! We make it all the time. This recipe also travels great...we make the chicken salad ahead, chill and keep in a cooler, then assemble with bread when we are ready to eat. It's wonderful and easy for travel or great picnicing. I've also made 100 sandwiches for a big gathering, went over great with teens and adults. The only changes I maKe are using real mayo, red grapes only, and sometimes i sub slivered almonds for a healthier choice and instead of celery we might put in celery seed.  It's also good with a pinch of tarragon. Thank you for such a yummy recipe!"
45902,18942,2002-07-23,5,This mayo is terrific on top of a focaccia sandwich with smoked turkey breast!
197456,321948,2012-06-24,5,"great recipe!  Followed the directions exactly, except for the seasoning. I used a pepper seasoning I have, mixed with a bit of cayenne for some heat.  Turned out beautiful.  I shaved the meat for roast beef sandwiches for the week.  Much tastier and healthier and cheaper than buying cold cuts.  Hubby is very happy right now!

128473,483458,2012-08-08,4,"We really enjoyed these sweet, hot and spicy carrots pammyowl.  They were really lovely.  Tender and perfectly cooked, with a big kick of heat.  I used 1 tsp of ground cayenne pepper.  Thanks for sharing this recipe for a quick and easy treat that is out of the norm.  I will be making these again...Made for Fearless Red Dragons - ZWT8 - Australia."
798586,8524,2008-11-12,5,"This was GREAT!! and super easy. I changed a few things according to what I had in my cabinets.
I use 2 chicken breast chopped and I sauted them in some butter with onions then in a different bowl I combined can of corn can of black beans washed and drained, can of chicken broth, can of cream of celery(substitued for the cream of chicken) I cut up fresh tomatoes (sub for the can of rotelle) put crushed tortilla chips on bottom of bakeware then chicken and onions, then my soup mixture sprinkled some chedder cheese on top and then more crushed tortilla chips and viola! baked and then served over warm egg noodles... WAS A HIT!!!!"
514761,110111,2008-10-24,5,"Absolutely delicious.  This was the very first loaf I made in my brand new bread machine and it came out wonderfully.  Great smell in the house, too!  I missed the unsalted butter part -- will have to make that adjustment next time.  Still it was awesome!!"
498271,494061,2013-10-24,5,Sometimes the simplest preparations are the best and this is one of those!  Couldn&#039;t be easier and absolutely delicious.  I reduced this to 2 servings and used a little extra parsley.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!  Made for My3Chefs 2013
988670,142542,2008-10-13,0,"Quick, easy, and tastes great!  I used cream of celery soup and it was wonderful!  My 8 year old devoured it!!!!"
538190,103106,2007-07-18,5,these were to die for!!!
28177,15200,2002-04-14,5,This was heaven!  Can't go wrong with the combo of Lemon and cheesecake!  We served with a dollop of whipped cream as well.  Thanks for the recipe!
10404,79275,2009-04-21,5,"I needed a Lemon Butter Sauce to clone a recipe for Spiedino Dimare.  I omitted the parsley, basil and paprika, and used on grilled shrimp and scallops.  Excellent Sauce!

Di;-)"
209255,21597,2006-01-26,5,"Made these up for my son to take to school to share with everyone for his birthday.  (So much better than cake!)  The one teacher ate 2!  They turned out so pretty!  I also dipped the tops in melted butter and then into the cinnamon/sugar.  I also did it while they were still warm.  (Hot actually.)  It didn't affect how they cooled or how the sugar stuck.  I took the advice of someone else and left over night in a closed container.  Wonderful, quick recipe!  Thanks for posting."
576952,48532,2008-02-13,5,This same recipe - except creamy Pnut Butter - was published by Martha Stewart. I would certainly recommend that you go with the better quality chocolate!! Awesome.
268058,219707,2007-06-01,5,YUMMO ! We do this all summer w/ mint from the garden !
168896,178699,2006-07-22,5,excellent dish. delicious and easy recipe.this recipe is an absolute no fail recipe.  and you can do so much with it.  i made two batches.  one as the recipe stated (except i used broken up pieces of roasted garlic instead of minced) and the other i added a can of good white chunck tuna and put in the fridge for my lunch tomorrow.  but before i did i took a taste and it was delicious.  this recipe wouldnt be the same without ripe tomatoes so take advantage of it now!!!!!!
98719,58327,2003-11-28,5,This is a savory and satisfying sauce.  Easy to make. The second time I made it I didn't have enough tomato paste so substituted extra tomato sauce and made adjustments to the water.  Same great results!  
38273,88982,2004-05-31,5,"I was looking up Amish Macaroni Salad since that was my assignment for today\'s picnic......and right here you were sis!  You\'re always there to help me out!  

I left out the carrot and only used 5 eggs since that is all I had.  The taste is great for a Weber family picnic.  Not fancy, just plain yummy!  My husband added salt to his........."
1236607,357523,2009-04-12,5,"Had been served these once and loved them, was thrilled to find this recipe, my family loves it."
426903,185689,2008-02-05,5,The sauce was amazing. I kept the chicken separate till the end like some of the reviews mentioned...and it turned out great. I will definitely be using this recipe again. Thanks for posting.
528087,104875,2007-06-30,5,"I learned how to make this cake when I was 17, from a friend.  Back then it was a ""secret recipe.""  I guess it's not-so-secret anymore.  Delicious cake :o)"

2002163459,254206,2018-05-24,0,How much sugar and how much waterwater
988608,65910,2012-12-21,4,"This was pretty good. Instead of making the crust, I just made the filling and poured it on top of grands biscuits. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the spices it called for ended up tasting odd to me when it was all cooked. Maybe smaller amounts next time."
128473,427791,2010-07-13,5,"Annacia, hands down my favorite tea on the site.  I loved it.  I did serve it hot and iced.  I preferred the iced version, it allowed all the flavors to shine thru.  The honey was perfect in this drink.  Made exactly as written, wouldn't change a thing my friend. Thank you so much for sharing this lovely recipe.  I have another batch sitting in the fridge waiting for tomorrow.  Cheers :)"
1419705,148722,2009-10-19,0,so smart to use potatoes.  lOVE THIS RECIPE
280271,356549,2014-03-18,5,Delicious! I think the baking powder really helps with the crispiness of the chicken...I flipped them half way thru and basted with additional olive oil...I did oil my wire rack like Noo suggested and it worked great...I used tenderloins...thanks for posting the recipe...=)
1197128,58428,2009-08-03,5,This has becom a staple in my house - my mom and sister have swiped the recipe as well!  I use chicken instead of pork and use lite (low sodium) soy sauce.  I usually make this a couple times a month!
1609858,483086,2013-06-13,5,Very refreshing!
2000138914,349189,2015-04-13,5,Delicious. Made this to go with prosciutto-wrapped cod (two servings). I followed the recipe to a T and have a lot leftover so I will halve it next time.
43893,27785,2002-06-12,1,"I live in southeast louisiana. I have lived here my whole life.
THIS IS NOT GUMBO!!!!!!!!"
1184866,293102,2009-04-17,5,Delicious!! You wouldn't know it was vegan. I used lemon juice instead of the vanilla extract for a zingy version and it worked perfectly on my vegan carrot cupcakes.
1068341,22855,2009-04-08,0,"This salad is awesome my mom makes it almost just exactly the same except, when she makes it she usues Thousand Island. It's sooooo good."
269480,198907,2008-06-09,5,"Mmm.. these is so delicious! Tastes like hot chocolate with a cinnamony taste. Followed recipe as is but using the microwave.   Then I poured them in 2 huge cups so it serves 2 since we're heavy coffee drinkers :D  Thank you, Sharon! Made for WZT4."
195841,18157,2005-09-13,5,What a wonderful thing to have in your pantry for emergencies or every day use! I needed cream of chicken soup and had none.  This recipe allowed me to make a favorite recipe in a jam.  I love it and plan on giving the recipe to everyone in my family.  Thank you for saving the day and posting this recipe!!!
2001262388,155118,2016-11-22,0,What size baking dish did anyone use? Sorry aid I posted twice - I'm new here.
65936,119724,2007-03-12,5,This is my 10 year old son's favorite meal.  When I am in a hurry I have made this using a roasted chicken from the deli (Sam's has really good roasted chicken at a reasonable price).
754704,61258,2008-02-06,4,Very sweet!  Perfect fudge texture.  After baking we put it in the frig and then ate it after naps! Would have liked a little more of the PB flavor.
228458,278073,2009-05-07,5,"I really loved these, and I felt great about giving them to DS since they are reasonably healthy for a cookie. I used Smart Balance for the butter, and I think the salt in it was fine (I love the sweet/salty combo of cookies, though). I used a combination of chocolate and butterscotch chips, and not very many at that--maybe 1 oz? I also cut back the sugar to 1/2 c, as my dates were sugared and dates are uber-sweet as it is. I definitely didn't miss the extra sweetness. Thanks for posting; I'll definitely make these again."
1301771,105080,2010-04-25,4,I like how this was very easy to make but for some reason was a bit dry for my tastes.  Maybe I should have added milk or water with the 2 soups?  The taste was very good though...
541453,115110,2008-05-14,4,"Made this for my family.  I sauteed garlic with the addition of onions and red bell pepper.  I really liked the flavor and texture, though my baking time was double what this recipe recommended.  I didn't love the tortilla crust - maybe because the long baking time rendered it almost uncuttable! I think I'd rather do a traditional crust next time with the same ingredients for the filling.  Thanks for a creative recipe!"
222055,123813,2005-09-16,5,"These are GREAT! I made them exact and everyone loved them. I had some left over, and I chopped them up and used them in omelets the next morning. They also were great! Thank you for this one ChefDebs!!!"
714950,186788,2008-01-04,5,"This cake was the BOMB!
I made it in a bunt pan.
It did require extra cooking time, but turned out great!
I took it to work and my co-workers LOVED it!
I will save this recipe and make this again, and again."
628279,150490,2009-01-01,4,"I really liked this but my boyfriend wouldn't eat it and he usually loves broccoli.  That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5.  I thought it was a nice twist as it gave it a whole different flavor, I ate a whole head of it myself!"
1380845,275776,2009-09-11,4,"This recipe was delicious! My dad and I made it and rather than using canned tomatoes we used some fresh salsa he had made earlier that week. The salsa had tomatoes, onions, poblano peppers, cilantro, and jalapeno peppers. 

Fantastic flavor! Everyone loved it, Thank you!"
950802,223508,2009-09-20,5,"this is the softest roll!  i made a double batch, and didnt have nearly as many as i thought i would have left over to freeze ;) 
they thawed and reheated well too"
724593,286794,2009-04-14,5,Totally delicious Jambalaya!  The best I have had and I've eaten it a few times!
286566,145038,2010-12-09,5,"I used chicken wings (1 oz short of 5 lbs worth - 18 wings in total including tips - ) so I upped the sauce as follows taking into account dietary needs - 3 1/3 T olive oil, 3/4 cup soy sauce (low sodium), 3 1/3 T tomatoe sauce (ketchup). 1/2 cup honey and 5 teaspoons of minced garlic.  I poured this over the wings and let them marinate for a few hours and cooked as directed (they were well crowded in the pan) and baked them for 1 hour at 175C fan forced oven and turned them over about half way through the cooking time.  Delicious with the sauce drizzled over the rice and steamed vegetables.  Of the 18 cooked we ended up with 5 left over and it is a bun fight between the DM and me as to who gets them for lunch tomorrow - so maybe if will have to be a snack for each of us.  Thank you djmastermum for a great recipe (which I will be trying with a quartered chicken) , made for Aussie/Kiwi Swap #37 February 2010."
474941,178701,2008-07-06,5,I have just finished my meal of this and it was superb! Wonderful flavour! I did change the recipe a bit.  I put the veal in the slow cooker for 8 hours instead of the oven and I omitted the pepper and the mushrooms. While it was cooking I roasted veges in the oven and made some gravy. Absolutely divine. Thank you. I will make this again soon especially as it is quite cold here in OZ at the moment.
181123,24951,2008-02-02,5,This was the first margherita pizza I've ever made--so simple and sooo yummy! I used a whole wheat crust from Trader Joe's and the olive oil and garlic on the crust really made a huge difference in taste. I can't wait until tomatoes are in season to try this with some really fresh tomatoes. Will definitely be making this one again!
779556,210828,2008-03-02,5,Excellent!
62264,243627,2007-08-13,4,"Loved the butterscotch over the saltines! My Hershey's milk chocolate chips failed me though - the lil buggers WOULD NOT melt! I even put my tray back into the oven for 10 minutes to help them along! Next time I'll melt the chocolate in a double boiler while the crackers bake & pour it over top. The combo fo sweet, salty, crispy, buttery & chocolate are PERFECT PMS therapy (nibbling on them while they are still warm...:)). Thank you Chef 549471 for this yummo combo -deciding whether to share..."
110875,5247,2004-06-21,5,This worked great.  Thanks.
900992,145705,2010-01-06,3,Pretty bland (and I even added extra garlic). Maybe I did something wrong.
167275,242890,2007-08-20,4,Got my version from Dr. Weil too.  I make it bassically as this recipe indicates.  I've made with 2 cups of dried beans then cooked after soaking.  I made it today with 2 cans of GN beans and it worked just as well.  I simmered the beans to make the broth thinner so I could drain.  I also add extra seasonings.  I served it with homemade pita chips for an Italian style hummus.
128473,448067,2011-11-21,5,"Loved, loved, loved this recipe Awalde.  It was so quick and easy to make and now I can enjoy it whenever I want.  Thank you so much for sharing your special recipe.  I ground all my spices for a lovely mellow flavor, it was perfectly spiced and just sweet enough."
614471,376332,2009-10-25,5,"Great recipe!  Couldn't believe how simple and tasty this was!  I agree with the reviewer who said they made this three times in three days.  With Halloween coming up, I believe I will be following in their footsteps!"
126440,51384,2005-05-10,5,"This is a very delicious recipe and very quick to put together.  We had this tonight for dinner, I only used 1/3 of 8 oz. pkg low fat cream cheese, used one borrito size tortilla, about 6 oz. of Monterey Jack cheese.  Baked it for about 25 min.   "
1155603,61402,2010-08-18,5,"I was very pleased with how this recipe turned out.  I've never baked cookies with zucchini before, and was a bit skeptical at first.  I did make a few changes though - instead of walnuts, I added 1/2 cup of ground almonds and 1/2 tsp. almond flavoring.  Delicious!"
102607,85644,2008-09-07,5,"This bread had a great texture and my husband loved the crust.  I wanted to make a true sourdough bread, so I increased the starter to 2.5 cups, omited the yeast and reduced the water to 1/2 c.  I could only get 5 c. flour total into it, but it was perfect.  I wish I had let my starter sour more, but it is good anyway!"
111520,166403,2007-10-11,4,"For something without garlic in it, this is just as wonderful! Could not find sorrel, and the 2nd time I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 yogurt - the 3rd time I used sour cream instead of yogurt.  I feel like putting every green herb on earth in the next sauce, just to experiment! Will make this often."
37779,9736,2003-07-20,5,A delicious baked grits dish. Grits and mashed potatoes run neck and neck as a favorite in my household. The texture was creamy and the flavor was rich and cheesy with just the right amount of pepper. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
621626,423802,2010-06-17,5,"I made recipe in my tagine. Instead of serving over rice we used thick bread to scoop it up, Moroccan style. Made for ZWT6 - No-Nonsense Nibblers"
29404,63828,2010-01-25,5,"This comes out perfect everytime.  I've recommended this recipe to all who will listen! 
Tx for the post."
88099,142483,2006-07-12,5,"Excellent.  I used my grill basket to grill these and it worked great.  I added a little more garlic and extra lemon juice, but other that stayed with the recipe as written.  Thanks Rita"
37449,42723,2003-01-29,5,"I loved this bloomin' onion! The sauce tastes just like Outback's! I had to cook the onion just a few more minutes to get it to brown. I accidently cut all the way through the onion, so be careful if using a knife to cut through!"
1803561643,498581,2014-12-25,5,"Excellent salad!  It&#039;s quick and easy to make. If you have to reduce the salt in your diet, cut the salt in half and it&#039;s still fabulous.   I&#039;m going to make more of the dressing to use on other salads as well!"
111005,96066,2005-10-18,5,"Delecious!  I really liked the fact I didn't need cream of chicken soup.

56112,114415,2005-06-21,5,I love this sandwich with my choice of cheese being provolone.  Thanks for posting.
2002059611,443758,2018-03-18,0,"FIrst of all I added ground mustard, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, minimum amounts of crushed rosemary and low amount of chili powder into a small bowl and mixed my spices. Then I coated the oven tray in olive oil then sprinkled the spices onto the pan. Then rolled the chicken in the oil and spices in pan. Sprinkled little extra spice mix. At the 25 min mark, before the skin sticks I flipped the chicken adding extra spices from my mix put back in for time until temp was reached. Came out with a slightly crunchy skin with an amazing flavor."
96177,329170,2009-02-14,5,"So quick and easy, we love this kind of recipe. All these ingredients are on hand, and we love that even more. Couldn't find roughy, so used Costo Cod and thought it was great. Nice flavor and crispy texture. Made for holiday tag."
399474,274695,2008-05-13,5,YUM!! Very tasty smoothy love the combination of flavors. My 20 month old DD and I had this for breakfast. She said YUM and ate the whole thing! SO I think we will be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!Made for PAC Orphanage Spring 08
173579,105616,2005-02-16,5,I started to put this recipe in until I saw it was already here.  This is a very tasty grilled cheese sandwich.  Something very different.  Thanks for posting.
130819,188437,2008-12-31,5,WOW - this is really good! Leslie's photo had me needing to give this recipe a try ... thank you Leslie! Made threading on chunks as well as threading on long thin pieces - both looked so appealing and tasted as good as they looked. Being minus 40 with the wind chill here on the prairies I grilled them in the convection oven.Quick and easy. Served these wonderfully juicy and tasty chicken skewers with recipe#87803 -  recipe#188736 and plum sauce. Thank you Peter and be sure to thank Russell - happy you both shared!
238482,219462,2007-11-28,4,"I enjoyed this dish. The two-star rating Prairie Moon Girl gave was undeserved, as it was her own error of judgement that spoiled the dish for her. I would like to try replacing the Mozzarella with Emmentaler cheese."
516926,272187,2009-04-17,4,Tried this with shrimp but am looking forward to doing the Ahi. Thanks Carol! Made for PAC Spring '09
308434,12455,2008-12-19,5,"We really enjoyed this!!  I made as directed and cooked it in the wood cook stove.  I browned the pork in a cast iron pan...and then added the rest of the ingreds, covered it and popped it back in the oven.  I used a medium sized orange, but next time will use a larger one as I would have liked more goo (sauce).  It was just wonderful on the yams. I will definately be making this again!!  Thank you Derf for sharing this wonderful dish!"
593927,38413,2012-03-06,5,"Delicious. It tastes like Christmas spices but also fresh from the lemon zest. I used Balkan yogurt, creamed honey, allspice in place of nutmeg in a lesser amount because we do not consume intoxicants, powdered ginger, plus the rest of the ingredients. We had this over recipe#112648 which I recommend without the banana in it. I would make this again the same way."
2749898,42780,2013-03-23,5,I thought this was going to be a mediocre fish fry recipe but after having just one bite I was hooked. The coat was crispy and golden and delicious. I will never use another recipe. THIS WAS AWESOME!
158086,173742,2008-02-03,1,"I should have known better than to try this one, as I am notorious for setting off my fire alarms in my kitchen....I think I put too much oil on them and then they dripped onto the bottom and really started smoking....so took them out and cleaned up the bottom of my oven, and put them back on laying on a pan....may not turn out as krispy, but a heck alot easier on the cook...(and the dog that runs out in the garage when the alarms go off...ha ha.."
1861298,348802,2011-03-21,4,"This recipe is awesome.  It's easy and delicious. Anoter review suggested adding 8oz of sour cream at the very end, which makes for a richer creamier soup. It's so good."
1217857,39404,2009-03-29,5,"I was so happy when I found this website and especially your recipe for Three Ingredient Italian Sponge Cake.  My Mom who's since passed on made a cake very similar if not exact if I remember right to yours.  We sold the house and left her special Italian 12"" cake pan and recipe in the basement kitchen by mistake.  We been so sorry for so many years.  She use to bake it for all of our birthdays.  She used the one pan and cut it twice to make three layers.  Her cream was exactly like yours but, she seperated it in half and put cherries in the vanilla part and the other half she put cocoa and chopped walnuts and lots of home made whipping cream icing.  Thank you so much for sharing the best ever moist, delicious and wonderful recipe with recipezaar.  I'm going to surprise my family and make it for my sister's 73rd birthday.  It's been a long time. This has made me so happy I almost cried.  Thank you for your generosity with all of your recipes and I enjoyed seeing your Italian Kitchen.  I can't wait to try the other things you've told everyone about.  God Bless You and Buona Pasque!"
424680,147777,2008-10-20,5,"These made for a GREAT & UNUSUAL addition to my finger food counter, & with a little bit of festive sprinkles on top would fit nicely into the winter holidays! Thanks for the keeper! [Tagged, made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in the current Pick-A-Chef]"
1535,61889,2007-11-23,4,This soup comes together very quickly. We liked how it was flavorful but not overly spiced. I served it with Recipe #267178 and it was a perfect cold weather meal that took only about 30 minutes to pull together. Great comfort food!
64667,234840,2007-06-30,4,"*Made for ZWT3 Jerk Challenge* This was very good and a great introduction to the world of Jerkified food for my family!   I pretty much followed the recipe, altho' I threw together a regular salad (used the dressing recipe as is here).   I threw the Basic Jerk ingredients into my tiny food chopper and whirled it a bit, then added the Sweet Jerk ingreds & whirled it some-more.   Cut the meat into strips & threaded onto skewers, then grilled 'em.   Didn't do the veggie skewers since we also were having Strawberry Shortcake....  Very lovely meal!"
63427,34382,2009-11-21,5,I doubled this recipe.  I diced up about 8 cloves of garlic and steeped them in simmering water for about an hour before adding the potatoes.  As other reviewers suggested I increased the Parmesan cheese.  Amazing!  Even better the day after reheated with a little cream....mmm...yum!  Thanks MizzNezz :P
266635,536383,2018-09-13,5,"These were definitely loaded and delicious. I ran out of green pepper, so I used mild green chilies. Loved the red onion and peppers and the creamy texture from the sour cream and cheddar cheese. Great Breakfast!"
70854,11930,2005-02-04,3,"These were easy and the texture came out great.  However, my daughter and husband did not care for the lemon flavor, (My son and I thought they were only ok.)so I won't make them again. I may try them without the lemon juice, or look for a different roasted potato recipe."
1125105,86379,2009-01-11,5,Just made this and it was a big hit. I tweaked it and only used 2 teapspoons cinnamon.  Definately a keeper.
176615,1985,2014-02-16,5,"Really good and different dressing with some bite to it. Used on a simple salad on lettuce, broccoli slaw, and grilled chicken. The kids didn&#039;t love it, but my husband did. Will make again! Thanks for sharing!"
1022482,315823,2010-03-06,5,I only did the sweet potatoes and they were delicious I'll be making them again and again...thanks for posting.
163386,12688,2008-07-20,5,"Just finished making this.  Yum, it is so good.  I will be making this every year from now on.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe:)"

makes a good egg roll."
586000,136589,2008-03-10,0,OH MY! this was the best cake ever. I made this recipe for my family and they almost ate the whole cake in one evening because they loved it so much. I will try adding a touch of Cinnamon to the recipe next time.
1389210,10125,2009-12-08,3,"These were almost good.  They tasted yummy, but I could detect a powdery taste from the pudding mix.  I didn't tell my husband that this recipe had anything unusual about it, but after he took a bite, he looked at me with a puzzled look on his face.  He knew something wasn't quite right...  Not sure how to get rid of the undissolved powder taste,  but if I could, these would be great cookies."
280271,219449,2008-03-13,5,This is so good! Very Asian tasting. This is really fast to throw together and looks great plated. I use soba noodles. So I skipped step 2 and cooked everything in a wok. I just zapped the noodles for 45 seconds in the microwave to soften them. Added them to wok and heated with the veggies. Wonderful flavor and full of color. I cut the recipe in half. If you come across this recipe you must make it. Thanks rickoholic83 for posting.
1223458,189156,2013-09-25,4,"This was tasty, but I also found that it made far too much batter. Next time, I will double the cream cheese filling, and plan on making closer to 36 muffins. I used the extra batter by covering the cream cheese with an extra Tbsp of batter for a dozen muffins. I poured the remaining batter into a loaf pan, and made a small pumpkin bread."
434697,381634,2013-07-07,5,Very nice moist loaf cake. Not too sweet and a good chocolate flavour. Be careful not to overbake!
1153793,145312,2009-04-26,5,These were amazing and so easy to make!  I did add one egg to it and made it in a 9 by 13 pan and it took about 24 minutes.  They were nice and moist and we ate it all in the first day!  Next time I will try with the oats or chocolate chips!  One of the best weight watcher recipes I have ever made :)
2000056227,55977,2015-03-11,5,"Very easy and tasty recipe,  still developing my cooking skills and had to substitute noodles for fusilli pasta which still came out like a dish you would get and zizzi&#039;s"
1628410,66241,2011-10-02,5,These had to be the BEST pancakes I have ever had!! I sifted the flour to ensure that they would be super fluffy and OMG they were like clouds. Melt in your mouth goodness. <br/><br/>My 6 year old who is a quite picky eater had 2 and wanted more....even my 6 month old was TRYING to steal a bite or should I say gum a bite. <br/><br/>Thank you so much for sharing this incredible recipe! This will be a staple in my house
124249,105454,2006-07-20,5,"I haven't had this in years. My Mom served this with her vegetable soup. The only thing we did different was to use cheddar instead of American cheese. Both are good. 

Thanks roseplummer.

Bullwinkle."
560429,101699,2008-01-14,5,"Yes!  We LOVED this recipe, now we don't have to travel 140 miles to enjoy Ivar's!  I added an extra can of clams, substituted 3 tbsp dehydrated minced onion rehydrated with 6 tbsp hot water for the fresh onion, and substituted 4 cups fat free condensed milk for the half & half and the recipe was still AWESOME (and a quite a bit lower in fat!).  Prep time took me more than 10 minutes, but it was well worth it!!"
1663041,181242,2012-04-19,5,Excellent.  The whole family loved it.  I'm looking forward to having this in my summer meal rotation!  Thanks.
2737728,329127,2013-03-15,4,Don&#039;t use cornstarch. Corn is a grain and ALL grains have gluten (same goes for rice). Use potato starch instead - it gives a better result too!
797486,323492,2009-04-05,5,"Very tasty! These are a really good alternative to an omlette for breakfast, or even as a hors d'oeuvre. The parmesan gave them a nice little kick, and the cheddar & bacon went really good together. I would recommend serving these immediately because even though they puff up nice and high in the oven, they fall pretty quick (as you can see in my picture). Thanks for this yummy recipe. I'll be making it again soon!"
131674,287639,2008-02-29,4,This is a very good rice dish.  My boys liked it and especially because it had bacon in it.  I didn't even look at the calorie count...you have got to splurge sometimes especially when 3 can eat a whole bowl.  Thanks for a good recipe.  Made for photo tag.
568065,238295,2007-08-30,4,These cookies turned out great. They have a nice crunch anad are delicious! I think next time I will use a little less sugar though.
424680,378796,2009-07-29,5,"I love eating sweet potatoes almost any way I can have them, & this recipe makes for A GREAT TREAT! Almost cut back on both the cayenne pepper & the curry, but then decided to find out how it tasted as written ~ VERY, VERY NICE FLAVOR COMBO, & I'll be making these again! Thanks for sharing! [Tagged, made & reviewed in the current Unrated Asian Recipe Tag Game]"
428885,383849,2009-08-18,5,"Made this early the morning, and had it sit all day. I could hardly wait, as anticipation grew to devour this gazpacho that came directly from the garden to the table, and right into our hungry stomachs. I followed this exactly, except I used Spicy *V8* instead of tomato juice. This was so tasty and good, I can only hope to make it again tomorrow! Perfect.... :) Made for *Please Review My Recipe* August 2009"
226863,185586,2013-06-25,5,"Perfect!  So easy and just delicious!  A definite do-again recipe, I&#039;ll keep it and make these often.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for Holiday tag game."
1764438,134081,2010-12-17,4,"Simple dish and tastes amazing, fairly low fat too which is a bonus. I serve on mash with mange tout and carrots or asparagus"
2002252850,82985,2018-08-20,5,Delicious! I love cornbread and this came pretty close. I cooked it a little longer and it turned out just fine. I will definitely make this again!
27678,12711,2002-11-27,5,"My partner only brought me back one bottle of cactus pieces from his trip to Las Vegas and am I ever glad we chose this recipe to use it in! It is very much like a fresh salsa and although we could have used it as a topping for tacos, we lapped it up as a side dish to our main Mexican meal. Thanks Di!"
876513,155186,2010-04-13,4,"This was so easy to make! I used Green Olives as they are my personal preference, next time I make this though I think I'll also use a spicier taco seasoning, and a 'hot' Salsa- my darling really enjoyed this but had to add Tobasco sauce as he found it a little bland for his taste. Next time I'll kick the heat up a notch and it will be perfect! Thank you for sharing!"
430767,65340,2010-02-01,5,"Excellent rolls!!  My bread machine only holds 2 cups of flour so I had to half the recipe-I had no problems.  Instead of putting the ingredients in per manufacturer's suggestion, I proofed the yeast first by warming the milk to 90-100 degrees (yes, I used the digital thermometer) in a glass bowl, then sprinkle the sugar, then yeast and allow it to foam for 10 min. Then I added that to my bread machine pan and added the other ingredients.  I also had to let them rise for 2-3 hours and I baked them at 350 for about 22 minutes.  DELISH!"
104295,132220,2005-10-09,5,"Yummmmm.  I halved this thinking it would be plenty for 4 people, but we certainly wanted more.  I used low fat ice cream and it was very sweet and cherry flavored.  Thanks for a yummy treat."
79466,76453,2006-09-04,5,"This is a wonderful base recipe!  I hate wasting leftover rice, this is the perfect solution.  I used half brown sugar and half granulated sugar.  I also matched the measure of nutmeg with some best quality ground cinnamon.  I used the whole eggs for a bit more body.  I substituted the milk for evaporated and it gave such a rich, deep flavor and fabulous creaminess.  The rice was basmati, so the delicate flavor of the rice really worked in this recipe.  I wonder what the addition of a bit of canned pumpkin and some pumkin pie spices would do for this?  Oh, the possibilites are endless!"
169430,517573,2014-08-06,5,"What a tasty change of pace for pork chops. Served with some fresh green beans, Russian Black Bread and BK&#039;s Tom&#039;s Vladivostok Potato Salad. The chops aren&#039;t at all difficult to do and the taste was very enjoyable indeed. In particular the caraway was my favorite addition. Thanks much Lynn."
163112,163569,2007-06-10,5,OOOOH KIWI!!  I was so happy to find this recipe!  They had baby artichokes at the store the other day so I snapped them up.  Then I found THIS in the French Tour Cookbook.  The artichokes were fabulous!!  Made for ZWT3.  Thanks!
444132,77801,2010-02-21,5,"Yummy muffins!  These are really easy to make!  I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter, but made the recipe as posted otherwise.  When they came out of the oven, I inverted them and quickly scraped the extra sugar/butter on to the top of the nuts - it gets hard fast, so you need to move quickly!  Great recipe, I'll definately make it again.  Made for Top Favourites of 2009 Tag."
1056391,216437,2009-04-08,5,"A great recipe for a week night when you need a fast meal that doesn't taste like one.  I actually brushed the steaks with a little olive oil, pepper, the garlic powder & seasoning salt and cooked them on the George Forman while I prepared the sauce.  The only other change I made was to add 1/2 tsp of minced garlic to the sauce.  It came out perfectly!"
118849,79030,2003-12-25,4,"Very easy to make, and tasty.  A little dry, but most coffee cakes are.  I put raisins in (1/2 c?)and more would probably have been even better.  I set all the ingredients out Christmas Eve and baked it up on Christmas morning -yummy"
369715,356912,2009-04-07,5,"We had these for lunch and everyone loved them. I let my boys ""make their own"" which they enjoyed. Nice quick easy lunch. Made for Spring PAC 2009."
138706,73667,2010-06-25,5,"Yummy and very easy!  I was looking for something to do with all these cheap fresh tomatoes I had, and tried this recipe.  I roasted the tomatoes in the oven at the same time as the garlic, then peeled and chopped them into the soup.
Have made lots of it and frozen it for future use.  It is very tasty and I am going to try it chilled as well as hot, depending on the season.  Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe!!
Tricia in Oz"
255344,314217,2013-06-18,0,"I was out of town and wanted to use this recipe to cook chicken, but I didn&#039;t have my cookbook.  Thanks to you I could still do it!  This is a keeper of a recipe, especially for caper lovers like my family."
553933,73927,2008-01-06,5,"For a diet recipe, this is great!  I used Splenda as others suggested and used lite canned peaches.  So quick and easy!  My daughter on WW was thrilled."
709527,129345,2008-08-30,5,I made along with Recipe #27876 for one heck of a delicious meal!  The chicken was so juicy and tender and the flavors were right on!  Served for company and the meal was a special one!  This was not difficult to prepare.   I will make again as the family asked for it again soon!  I did as Zett and Oxford did and doubled the sauce. and did add mushrooms.  So very good!
104295,164989,2006-07-29,5,"I wish I had more then 5 stars to give this soup.  Absolutely divine.  It is one of those things that are so good, but you can't quite figure out how it was that good with those few ingredients.  I made this in the afternoon and let it sit until dinner.  I served it as part of a cold dinner, along with a huge salad, and some pita and hummous.  I used fat free vegetable broth instead of the chicken and I could see using margarine and serving this vegan too.  Really wonderful recipe, Paula.  Thanks!"
138277,125897,2006-06-09,5,I LOVED This recipe. This was my first attempt at grilling salmon as well. Turned out perfect! I bought some wonderful salmon at whole foods and marinated it for 2 1/2 hrs. Thank you for sharing!
695933,94993,2008-07-20,5,"I can't give you anymore than 5 stars. But I can give AA+.as will. I can say thank you Marg for posting such a great recipe and everyone needs to try it.Won't regret it, you will love these, I'm keeping this recipe. Grpa !"
246525,132261,2010-06-08,4,tried this recipe and turned out fabulous...  but next time i'll leave out the choc chips...  the taste of the chocolate did not blend well with the irish cream.
1211708,347212,2014-03-19,5,"I have been making this recipe since 2010....&lt;br/&gt;It is Everyone&#039;s favorite!&lt;br/&gt;I personally roast the Red Peppers, Tomato&#039;s and garlic on an open fire outside which takes extra time but it is WELL worth it.&lt;br/&gt;Tomorrow is my son&#039;s birthday and guess what he wants for his birthday dinner.&lt;br/&gt;Yep! &lt;br/&gt;The ingredients are wonderful when put together, but its a moms love that makes it all come true.&lt;br/&gt;So Thank You to Manda C for this GREAT Recipe.&lt;br/&gt;Tess"
62043,75505,2003-11-19,5,"I didn't have any stuffing- but used everything else listed. I also included 2 bay leafs, 10 peppercorns, and some kosher salt. Turned out really well. I think the gravy gave it alot of additional flavour. Thanks Chia."
556583,217454,2012-03-29,5,I make this recipe all the time.  Only frosting I ever use.  First couple of times were stressfull but I have it down now.  Love it in Chocolate too.  going to try coconut for Easter!  You will never use another buttercream after you try this.
93230,58226,2004-04-11,5,My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. I have already made it twice in less than two weeks. 
68357,64588,2003-07-13,5,"Rates 5-Stars or more! This worked wonderfully - and the fat drained off the chicken, too.  I inserted a large branch of rosemary into cavity of chicken and sprinkled my special herbs on top.  I'm going to try this method to cook chicken breasts, thighs, etc. to make chicken salad as it retains more flavor and less fat than stewed chicken.  Thanks for the wonderful idea!"
1808171,230740,2011-01-27,5,"Tried this recipe last night and it was a huge hit!!  Super yummy!!  Although I love Mexican-inspired flavors, this was my first time using adobo sauce....and I have to say, I didn't know what I was missing.  Those onions were pretty much the best part and I can't wait to incorporate them in other dishes.  Instead of chips, I sliced some hard rolls into about 1/2 think slices then used a circular cookie cutter close to the size of the hamburgers and did a nice little stack.  Definitely try this recipe, you don't be disappointed."
1535,262931,2009-05-05,5,"This is my favorite cold, damp morning breakfast! I put about 1/3 cup steel cut oats and enough water to cover it in the microwave for 1 minute. (Watch carefully so it doesn't boil over.) I then add 1/2 tbls. brown sugar and any spices that strike me and stir well. Top with the walnuts and blueberries and enjoy! It is like a warm blueberry nut muffin without all the work! :)"
43083,164680,2006-06-10,5,"Wow...this was SO good! I, too, left off the parmesan cheese and felt it didnt need it. The soup seemed almost creamy though it had no cream. Thanks for another winner Kitten!!"
2783621,259622,2013-04-13,5,"Loved this!  The texture of the cake was very good, as was the lemon flavor.  I did not use the lemon curd filling and I used a lemon buttercream frosting instead.  Would definitely make again!"
92641,93158,2004-12-18,3,"I've read this recipe over and over and wonder where I went wrong.  I used a 3.5 lb. chuck roast, followed the directions exactly and then cooked for 8 hours on low.  While the flavor was great, the meat was dry.  Plus there were barely enough drippings to make any gravy.  I'd like to try this again, maybe adding a bit of water or beef stock.  I'll be sure to post a new review when I try this, but thought I'd mention to others that some may want to try adding a bit of liquid to keep the roast moist.  This dish is super easy to prepare and I'm hoping additional liquid will make the difference for me. Thanks for posting this recipe."
57222,98415,2011-05-29,5,"Delicious, and couldn't be easier! Thank you!"
329769,485259,2012-08-24,5,Loved these Bhajis. Easy to make and and a good blend of spices included. Served with raita for a delicious started to an Indian meal. Reviewed for Zwt8 tour of India. Photo also to be posted. These are gluten-free provided the spices used a gluten-free
102135,95831,2005-03-20,5,excellent!!! this was a huge hit. thanks so much.
2000614175,89751,2015-10-28,4,"Good recipe.  The only change I made was using coconut oil!  The cupcakes had the consistency of a cake mix, and tasted like  vanilla cupcakes.  I would have liked higher cupcakes, but they did rise.  Thank you for the recipe!"
366076,48974,2006-11-17,5,"Made this two ways, both of which were outstanding! First, vegan using ""Earth Balance"" buttery sticks, vegetable broth, and ""Silk"" soymilk. Also made it as stated, and this produced a delightful warm soup for both my husband, and son. Thanks!"
694087,271904,2007-12-19,5,What a hoot!  My belly is jiggling like a bowl full of jelly!  Just the thing for those on my naughty list-Santa likes to pull pranks once in a while too.  Thanks for the great idea!
383346,232449,2010-09-21,5,This is so yummy.  I made half the recipe.  I used yellow mustard and light mayonnaise.  I used it in a panini with ham.  It went perfectly with the ham.  Thanks SweetsLady :)  Made for Holiday tag game
1305993,368749,2009-06-25,5,"I made about half this recipe and altered it a little (I can't help myself) but it was delicious.  My husband doesn't like chard, but he loved this.  My dinner guests asked for the recipe.  I did add some fresh dill, and used white cheddar. Even though it was great, I'm sure gruyere would be much better.  I cooked it at 250 for 2 hours or more. Will make this even when my voluminous chard crop is reduced to frozen chunks in freezer bags!"
274467,222187,2012-05-28,5,"This was incredible! I made it today to top a strawberry cake and it was cool and light, sweet and tart, just the right balance. This made a perfect summer dessert. I didn't change a thing, and I'm glad I didn't. Thank you for sharing the recipe. This one is a sure winner."
424680,470680,2012-01-27,5,"We wanted some great tasting pancakes to share with a dear friend the other morning, & your recipe provided just that!

252514,138832,2013-06-14,5,"What a brilliant idea for comfort food. Be sure to use a good quality marinara sauce as it really comes through in the dish. Served mine with buttered garlic bread. Yum. Thanks, Kittencal. [Made for Name That Ingredient.]"
89831,154128,2007-01-04,5,"I knew I would love this recipe, this soup has so much flavor! I added in 3 tablespoons fresh minced garlic and 2 jalapeno peppers with the onions, I used chicken broth, I love this soup and look forward to making it again many more times, thanks for sharing hon!...Kitten"
1802936715,29002,2016-01-13,4,"I have a family of four, 3 liked it and 1 didn&#039;t.  Very easy to make, might make again."
21730,27379,2002-05-21,4,Great Flavour! I wonder why never thought of putting these ingredients together :0)) I highly recommend using purple onion; the colour of this side dish is so pretty!
50969,176111,2008-03-11,4,"O.K. people :) Here's another great recipe from Kittencal. I made this on 3/10/08.Since there were just two of us I cut the recipe in half.I used the cooked,peeled potatoes as directed in the recipe,but I think next time (,and there will be a next time :) ) I'm just going to use peeled and diced raw potatoes.For the spices I used salt,pepper,garlic powder and a sweet paprika,and I think it was the sweet paprika is what put it over the top for me.Thanks for posting,and ""Keep Smiling :) """
255179,266186,2009-03-01,0,I love Chef Ramsay so what could I do but try this recipe?  Awesome!  Thanks sooo much!
870569,93829,2010-12-30,2,"I hvt agree w/BonnieZ.  This recipe is a great BASE.  I lacks something:  sweet chili sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, additions of this nature wld definitely liven up this dish.  It's relatively EZ w/the potential t/b great. TY for sharing. ;)"
2000204972,137530,2016-02-10,5,"This was great! The first Tagine I have ever been confident enough to make---it was a hit with the husband and friends. I made it exactly as described. Even the toddler ate the chicken and chickpeas out of it (he said the apricots were gross though--to be fair they were a bit mushy by the end, but so tasty!). We served it over brown Basmati rice. I think this would go well with yogurt as well. Great flavors! This served 3 adults and one toddler and we had left overs."
1298170,92204,2009-06-16,5,"My daughter is a mac & cheese connoisseur and won't order anything else at Outback.  I was sceptical, but this was exactly like Outback's.  She LOVED it!!  Follow the recipe exactly - no substitutions...."
858709,76930,2009-02-25,3,"Worth a try, very easy recipe. husband seemed to like it. It was not my favorite, but was good!
Thanks for the recipe."
593927,96689,2011-06-14,5,"Delicious version of muesli. I liked the currents in this although would have preferred it without banana. I also loved it with the fresh seasonal strawberries and raspberries I put on top. I would definitely use strawberries again in this. I used Allens apple juice, thick yogurt, allspice in place of nutmeg as we do not consume intoxicants, red delicious apple, as that is what I had on hand but can see it would be great with granny smith, creamed honey, plus the rest of the called for ingredients. I may make this again. Made for ZWT7 Switzerland, for my team Food.Commandos"
2000208000,312286,2015-05-17,4,"I like this soup. I love sweet potatoes! The recipe can be enhanced, as others have pointed out previously. I did it by giving it a little heat with cayenne pepper and chipotle pepper. I also added allspice and more of original spices. To make it faster I: 1.) used sweet potatoes I had previously baked. (I usually bake a bunch at the beginning of each week.) and 2.) heated up the soup stock and garbanzo beans while saut&eacute;ing the other vegies and spices. I used ghee instead of olive oil to give it a richness to match the selection of spices. I like it with fresh cilantro and pumpkin seeds toasted then season with salt, chili powder, a touch of organic sugar and cumin powder. I like the conversion from metric to cups, etc.  The recipe didn?t print the converted format however. And yes, the lemon is great at the end!"
279454,84490,2006-01-10,4,very good and easy
207478,211119,2007-09-05,5,So wonderfully tasty!!!  Love the cheese and the creme fraiche and the herbs.  I'll have to wait on telling precisely about the truffle oil because I had to use walnut oil instead.  It was great with walnut oil btw!  Thank you for a recipe I'll be trying when I can get truffle oil too!
275438,39087,2007-02-15,5,"This was a great recipe!! I added sauted onion and mushrooms for a little more variety in the pasta. I also threw in some crawfish meat. I doubled the ""sauce"" (cream, salt, basil, pepper and garlic powder) to cover the extra ingredients. Thanks for such a wonderful pasta dish. This is a definite keeper!!!"
37449,69932,2003-10-26,3,"I have a hard time giving low ratings, but Bergy, you have convinced me that I need to be honest and constructive so here goes.The recipe turned out bland, but I think it's because I just used plain cream cheese. I would like to try this again, using the Rondele cream cheese with garlic and chives and use cauliflower instead of broccoli. Whew. Thanks Bergy."
125388,70652,2009-05-25,5,"This was a very good sandwich; perfect for a casual meal.  I cut this down to 2 servings, using large grinder rolls.  I left out the American cheese, and the sandwich was still plenty cheesy without it."
481092,336075,2009-08-29,5,"Chef Jenny never disappoints.  For such a simple dish it really presents company worthy.  Sometimes I am a lazy cook and made the following changes for ease, but missed nothing on flavor.  I used thin sliced chicken breasts so no pounding and cooked in 3-4 minutes.  Instead of mustard seeds used Maille Old Fashioned style dijon that is loaded with mustard seeds.  Also subbed half and half cuz that's what I always have on hand.  Phenomenal recipe.  Served with rice cooked with asparagus and bell peppers which was a perfect combo with the sauce.  Easily a 5+ star recipe.  All the components:  taste, ease, presentation."
30716,32364,2002-11-19,4,"I made these today and they are very yummy! This recipe made 15 baking stones. The only problems I had were after the first 5 minutes when it says to turn them over, I found they were way too soft to turn over. I tried to turn one and it fell apart so I left them alone and baked the full 10 minutes on one side and they turned out just fine. Also next time I will reduce the salt by half as I can taste quite a bit of salt in them. These really are very tasty little treats. "
336058,223534,2007-06-05,5,"Wow!  Am I glad I found this.  A quick, nutritious (ie high protein) meal for the kids.  My egg hating DD said it tastes like french toast, and likes it! Yeah!  I made two.  The first I used plain oatmeal with 1/2 T water and 1 tsp powdered milk.  The second I used 1 T water and powdered milk, plus I used the cinnamon and spice packet.  It was a bit larger, but a bit harder to flip.  Either way was great. Thanks so much!"
143318,474029,2012-06-28,4,Delicious...tastes better than it looks! I had this for breakfast and enjoyed the mashed banana - will do that more often instead of sliced.
47907,302471,2009-04-17,5,I was looking for a really good catfish recipe and I think I found it.  It was easy to make and tastes delish!  Thanks for posting!  Made for PAC Spring 2009.
259064,176192,2006-10-10,5,"This ""fries"" are amazing.  Even my sweet-potato-hating fiance devoured them.  They are especially tasty when dipped in ranch dressing, although that kinda negates the whole low-calorie thing.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
2309448,481018,2012-06-28,4,"Great rice- and the recipe was pretty easy to follow. I'm pretty sure this is the first rice I've made that wasn't in a bag, and it came out great.<br/><br/>The only thing is the time is decieving- it took closer to 50 minutes to prepare, I believe."
133174,97523,2007-06-07,5,These are a much healthier alternative to fried doughnuts.  I used butter in place of the margarine and used some premixed cinnamon sugar mixture.  I found that it was easier for me to dip the dougnuts in the melted butter then sprinkle on the topping. Made for ZWTIII.
121840,104086,2008-01-16,5,"OK so add me to the list of believers in this soup!  Made as written but I added one can of black beans and one can of shoe peg corn.  I made homemade tortilla strips.  I used the crockpot and left it on low all day while at work.  It is a keeper and part of my favorites soups.  I didn't use the hot chilis but used one can of Rotel mild.  I added chipotole sauce to it, just maybe a teaspoon, no salt.  Topped with garnishes as recommended.  Can't wait for tomorrow when its left over.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe."
642088,67930,2017-08-17,5,"These are a great kids' breakfast! I followed others' advice and started with less milk (I found different brands of pumpkin can have more or less liquid). A couple changes to make them more healthy: I substituted half the flour for whole wheat flour, and I added 2 grated carrots at the end. They turned out delicious. I think grated zucchini would also be good. I was afraid that they would be too sweet, but the sugar was perfect to make them just barely sweet enough to eat on their own as a snack, or with syrup."
1159059,137151,2009-06-30,5,"This is a favorite of mine, I grew up with a Finnish family. This was absolutely amazing especially with melted cheese on the top. Thank you."
868654,48957,2008-07-10,5,"This was our dessert for the 4th of July picnic that we went to at a neighbors.  Everyone dug in and before I knew it the bowl was empty!  Good thing I took mine before everyone dug in!  We really enjoyed this one, and so did the neighbors!  Thanks for sharing it!"
51655,36543,2003-05-14,4,This was rhe first time I ever had Jicama. This recipe was good. Loved the taste. I am not sure if it was the recipe or the Jicama..but it was good
353131,324996,2010-01-26,5,Tried this last night using ground venison and four cheese flavor sauce. I cooked sauce all day in crock pot. Did not get to bake it but about 40 minutes because kids and Dh were starving!LOL! The smell was just getting to my son! He had to have it.This is a simple way to prepare lasagna and saves so much time! Will make again!!
743373,60323,2008-02-08,4,I really liked these! I used raspberry jam because that's what I had on hand.
638893,221522,2007-11-28,5,"My little brother is a huge noodles and company mac & cheese fan, but I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and he said that noodles and company must step aside cause there is now a better!"
689860,215919,2008-02-13,5,good
169430,391364,2009-10-10,4,"I'm going to have to go with a 4 rating too. I got a 3 and a 5  vote from the two guys who had this tonight. DH said 3 because ""It just tastes like potato soup"" and the 5 from our friend who loved ""the subtle additions"". I think it just comes down to how your taster works. Was to make and I love that it's low cal  so it's a no guilt first course."
264017,313118,2008-07-16,5,"Mmmm, what a great sammie! I made my own bread using Recipe #114100 and then layered on the listed ingredients except for the bleu cheese. for which I subbed Swiss and cheddar. Then I used my panini grill press for a hearty, delicious and quick meal! Thanks Shelby Jo!"
20480,56081,2008-09-09,0,"What  a special treat this was.We love Alfredo anything. Great to find this low fat recipe to enjoy. I bought frozen cooked shrimps from Costo  and with this recipe they tasted fresh. I will make this one again and again; thank you for sharing. It goes in my Best Zarr Our Favourites.
Rita"
1871845,102617,2017-05-31,0,"Not that Kit needs another review on this, but it is by far the best coleslaw I've ever had. I have made it for friends and family, and they always comment on how good it is. In fact I gave some extra to my sister who commented, &quot;It was better the next day&quot;, so over time the flavor just improves. I do cut back on the sugar, as I like my slaw somewhat tangy, also don't use garlic, green onions, nor celery seed. Anyway another winner from Kit and thanks for sharing."
2002075301,92011,2018-03-25,5,"To me, this is the authentic irish soda bread that our ancestors made in their hearth ovens, in their isolated houses and ate to sustain themselves 'day in and day out' durig the Great Hunger.. Sure todays many versions are sweetened like cakes with raisins, honey, mollasses, sugar, etc., Why heck add a couple more ingredients and you can turn the batter into cookie dough..but back then, people were starving, and this was a bare minimum bread that didnt need to wait to rise, could still sustain you, and it kept you feeling fuller... longer. It was survival food. So next time youre celebrating your Irish heritage.. sure, make the nice tastey bread that your mom or grandmom made, celebrate and enjoy it.. but also for our history sake, make a simple hunger bread to remember what our people went through and what forced us to come to America..!!"
2477889,10744,2012-11-02,5,"Like the title says...""Delicious"" and easy to make!!! Being a food snob, this recipe has made my binder of recipes! Made it twice in the last 2 1/2 weeks and hubby can't get enough! He loves it! I would recommend making your pie crust from scratch...the combination is amazing and pie dough is very easy to make!"
1416790,37889,2009-12-10,5,"Not made yet but going to! The nuts in the pic are pecans though, but being called Almonds.
I'm in the UK so maybe we call almonds pecans over here or is the photo wrong?"
382203,391963,2013-12-01,4,Thank you for sharing this very tasty soup
542159,178212,2011-10-30,5,"Fantastic marinate! I went to two different supper markets yesterday and could not get lamb and at the second one could not even get pork chops as it was late I ended up settling for a pork stake and figured if it did not turn out I would just wait and review this recipe in a week or two when I could get lamb chops. Well guess what this marinate supper well on my pork steak and was Sooo Yummy. This recipe is a true keeper that I am already looking forward to using again, thanks for the post."
171669,15488,2006-11-22,4,"This fudge was easy to make and a real treat for my family also.  I didn't have any problems with the recipe.  The fudge was smooth, creamy, and tasted great!  I think those that had problems didn't cook the sugar/milk/butter combination long enough.  If you're not using a candy thermometer, make sure the water you are using to test the soft ball stage is cold.  Thanks--Melissa"
2001277800,422437,2016-12-01,5,"These are my go to gingerbread cookies every year. I noticed if you frost them at all they go soft, though. So, no little eyes and buttons. Whatever, I don't need flare. I also never bother to refrigerate, because after years of super firm sugar dough I just want the easier answer. Instead, I roll it out while it's soft and warm and make the cutouts on wax paper first. If there's time, i'll put the whole tray of cut cookies in the fridge for a bit to firm up while I make the next set. Best. Crunchy. Cookie. Ever."
498271,428026,2010-06-17,5,"Very interesting and tasty couscous!  I don't care for onion so left it out, otherwise made as specified.  This has a really rich flavor that I think needs to be served with something spicy - I served with recipe #422400 and it was a perfect balance.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for ZWT6, Zwizzle Chicks"
4439,32349,2013-06-19,5,"I took this to work for a pot luck dinner and it was a hit!! everyone wanted the recipe. i used CUBED  smoked ham, low fat cream cheese, low fat cheddar cheese, instead of the swiss cheese (just don&#039;t like swiss cheese) and low fat cream of chicken soup. it was a wonderful pot luck casserole and a keeper."
341344,12395,2008-10-23,5,"I wrongly assumed all indian food was heavily spiced - shows you how little I know.  Loved this.  Simple, healthy, and tasting.  I added a can of diced tomatoes, as recommended by another reviewer.  Will be making this again!"
1849811,15654,2015-12-25,5,Perfect holiday breakfast recipe.  Make it night before.  Used Challah bread which made it extra rich.  Don&#039;t think it needed the extra sugar.  Kids and husband aren&#039;t big eggnog big fans - like myself - and loved it.
440735,111558,2008-11-25,5,My husband said this is a 5 from the first bite.  I only had the sundried tomatoes in a package. Next time I will use the marinated ones.  My sauce really  did not thicken but no loss of flavor.  This was easy to make too.
47510,122369,2006-08-13,5,I used an angelfood cake that I bought and this recipe couldn't have been easier to prepare.  The presentation was beautiful and the flavor was scrumptious.  I used orange juice instead of liqueur.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!
242484,31559,2010-05-08,5,"Great recipe!  I marinated my chicken breasts for 4 hours, reserving a little sauce to baste over my meat while grilling and to mix in with my rice for added flavor.  I did add some garlic and red pepper flakes as some suggested also."
200115,64322,2006-10-06,5,"This recipe is awesome!  I followed it exactly, but did add extra cinnamon.  The topping is outstanding.  Don't be worried that it doesn't look crumbly enough, because it bakes up BEAUTIFULLY! The topping is tasty and forms a nice soft, chewy ""crust"" on the top.  I think I will use this apple crisp as filling for my next dutch apple pie.  It was definitely the best apple crisp I have ever made, and I thank you for posting such a KEEPER!"
45058,73362,2008-12-31,5,What a great and easy recipe! Made it for a party tonight. It was a big hit. Thanks so much!!
610880,47136,2010-06-20,4,Great Recipe! I had a little ground beef that needed to be used and cut it down to 1 serving. I would use a little more seasoning in the future but definitely a tasty treat;)
152976,13507,2006-11-14,5,"This is one of our favorites; I lost my recipe and you saved me by posting on the 'zaar!  Everyone I serve this to thinks it's a hit!  I couldn't disagree more about the veggies; it's an odd, wonderful combination!  Thanks!"
2002293627,16130,2018-10-06,5,Very simple and very delicious a nice healthy dessert. I cut the sugar to 1 cup in both the pudding and meringue. Perfect!
734238,145478,2008-02-12,5,Sooooooo good....my husband hates sweets and he ate 10 of these. I added a bit more butter than the original recipe.The great thing about these is they stay soft and chewy....great recipe!
542928,181286,2007-08-22,3,When my kids are sick of pbj I make a jam and cheese sandwich similar to this on.  It is whole wheat bread with light cream cheese and jam.  Very similar to this but with less fat.  It really is a refreshing change.
199697,250754,2009-01-03,5,"BEST CARROT RECIPE EVER!  My friend who doesn't like cooked carrots even liked them!  I used wine, instead of sherry, and didn't measure (whoops!).  The combo of the thyme and rosemary were wonderful on the carrots.  Don't make the mistake I made - and try to cook the carrots in the pan without first microwaving or steaming etc unless you like your carrots very very firm.
Thanks!"
641852,16781,2008-01-22,5,I loved it and also my family. Didn't use the milk and the croutons but used the lemon juice. I served it inside a rustic bread at a dinner party I had home(that was the third time I was making it) and everybody asked for the recipe. Thank you.
57042,48201,2007-06-26,4,"I gave this recipe 4 stars. My family has tried this recipe for our dinner several times and we loved it. It is easy and good tasting. My first time making this recipe I followed the directions to a T. I used shoestring french fris as a reviewer did but my fries never did crisp up but remanded soft. Another time I did not have cheese soup so I used cheez whiz, I also used 2 tsp garlic, and I used seasoned fries. I loved this recipe made this way it was yummy. And the most recent time making this I didn't have cream of mushroom so I used cream of onion and again I had only cheez whiz. I also only had on hand mexican style cheese. This turned out so good. I think the next time I make this I will omit the salt as it's a little to salty for my taste. I'd like to try this with Ragu Cheese sauce. I have a copy of this recipe. It is slightly different. It calls for 1 Ib ground beef, 1 can golden mushroom soup, no cheese or seasoning. It says to bake on 400 for 20 minutes. The rest is the same. Your recipe sounds much better. Thanks for posting christine (internetnut)"
1185700,216237,2010-01-18,5,This tasted liked mac and cheese but so much healthier! It was amazing! Definitely use a sharp cheddar cheese.
306797,162750,2008-11-13,5,"What a yummy dinner! I made this on the barbeque instead of using the oven. Didn't add salsa, as I had none on hand, but it was still wonderful. Served with suggested extras plus a saute of pepper, zucchini & onion. Thanks Wildflour for yet another keeper. Made as a recipenap for Aus/NZ Recipe Swap #14
Nov 2008  DH told me I had to review this again!  I made these tonight with chicken breast fillets & baked for 20 mins before adding the cheese - boy, were they great.  Thanks again Kelly for sharing this lovely recipe."
13483,28097,2002-05-30,5,What an interesting combination.  The pasta was great in this dish but the peanuts put it over the top.  I like it because it can be done ahead as well.  Thanks for posting this.
2000722118,113013,2015-11-30,0,"Nice recipe, but confusing. How do you transfer 8 ounces of oil into a 4 ounce cruet?  And when do you start timing the simmering? When you first turn on the flame, or a few minutes later?"
2002117793,161589,2018-04-29,0,I just used this batter and my hubby and son raved about it. The fish was delicious. It will become my go to batter for other foods as well.
465080,276304,2010-08-19,4,"This recipe was similar to another zucchini pie recipe that I have.  I subbed crescent rolls for the Bisquick.  Most importantly, I fried the zucchini and onion mixture in canola oil prior to mixing with the remaining ingredients.  That should be part of the directions, which is why this was only given four stars."
34122,42151,2002-12-17,5,"Great taste and super easy.  Even my husband loved it and he's not big on horseradish.  We went to the beach for the weekend last week and when we got there he asked me if I had packed any ""bar cheese"".  I put this in empty Boursin cheese containers.  I halved the recipe and it filled 3 containers."
311003,285560,2008-03-04,5,"This is a wonderful recipe for salmon.  I usually grill it, but found that it turned out very good when cooked in the oven.  The marinade added just the right amount of flavor -- it tasted jus wonderful and didn't overpower the fish.  I didn't have any wasabi, so I made a paste out of horseradish and used the same amount.  Thanks for such a superb recipe!"
225573,36008,2005-06-27,4,"I made this for my family and we liked it a lot.  I altered it slightly and used 3 1/2 Tbs of fresh parsley and cream of mushroom soup.  We had it over noodles, and the next day we ate the leftovers and loved it just as much!  Thanks a bunch."
251686,39331,2005-12-16,5,Fabulous!  I almost didn't make it because I don't like Dijon mustard.  Decided to try it and it was perfect.  Thanks.  Gloria
174808,364645,2010-08-26,5,"I served this as suggested, with salad as a supper dish. Everyone said it looked and tasted delicious, and the fresh basil aroma makes it extra special  - definitely the magic ingredient. I only had cheddar cheese but grating a little into the batter mix seemed to work fine. This rises up and looks so impressive when it first comes out of the oven but don't try eating it piping hot, wait at least until it's stopped sizzling and steaming, it's worth the wait."
104295,80461,2007-07-13,5,"Wow Chris, these really are wonderful little fudgey cookies.  This is what happened.  I wanted to make a dessert and I wanted to use up my last can of fat free sweetened condensed milk.  So I did a search for the milk, without graham cracker crumbs.  When I saw this I was interested, but didn't have any dry cherries.  Luckily I did have raisins so I went with it.  I used mini chocolate chips which let the chips be distributed all throughout the cookies.  We think some peanuts in here would be excellent.  They are very rich and fudgy and we enjoyed them."
297303,241362,2009-01-18,5,"loved this.  I used canned mango slices, drained.  will definitly make again."
427743,104676,2007-03-16,4,"i had been luking for this cake for years now thank u so much cant thank u enough but i was lovely didn last very long though lolz but thank u so much really wonder y nobody has rated this recipe yet
!!!!!!!!
great"
383346,225283,2010-11-01,5,"These mushrooms are so yummy.  I used red wine.  We ate them just like that, without steak.  Thanks Cylee :)  Made for I recommend tag game"
160974,26259,2006-10-04,5,"This was ""the best!"" I used Bobtail's Sweet Hot Mustard Dressing (similar but with mustard and honey) but added a touch of oregano. The olives and feta go great with the dressing. I just used raw red peppers for convenience. This has a great ""deli"" flavor. Thanks ngibsonn for posting.

Roxygirl"
885416,86300,2009-02-23,2,"I wasn't overly thrilled with this recipe.  My kids and I ate it and it just didn't have a lot of flavor.  I was really hopeful because the sauce seemd to be turning out well.  But before the DH got home to eat it, I added lots of ""grated"" parmesan cheese (I think the shredded just lacks flavor) and some seasoning salt and worcestershire sauce.  I think my additions made it a lot better.  I probably won't make this one again.  It just didn't have enough ""oomph"" for me.  Thanks!"
2001094056,149088,2017-11-20,0,diced tomatoes or tomato sauce????!?!?!?!?!?
526171,481766,2015-05-22,4,"This was delicious!   I made it with fresh chopped broccoli florets instead of spinach.  I reversed the amounts of bread crumbs and Cajun seasoning and am glad I did...it would have been too spicy for my family.  Even with 1Tbs Cajun to 2Tbs of bread crumbs, it still had a little kick.  Definitely will make this again!"
167103,99796,2004-10-12,5,"My family LOVED this recipe!!

Our family loves garlic so instead of only rubbing garlic into the meat we coated it with chopped garlic.  I didn't use measurements either.  I just made sure that the whole loin was covered as equally as possible.

I am so thrilled to find this recipe.  I looked at a lot of recipe sites for a good, quick, simple pork loin rub.  The morning after my husband said, 'That was the best pork loin I have ever had.'  

Thanks for the recipe!"
130819,204401,2007-11-28,5,"Who would have guessed an oven baked chicken could look so crisp! I used regular cracker crumbs,chicken pieces equal to one whole chicken and made as posted right down to the sea salt - and wouldn't change a thing. The seasonings were just right for our tastes and loved that it was so crisp and juicy. Have that copy right close by to be making again!"
464080,252069,2008-05-29,5,"I sincerely enjoyed this pizza. I used pizza crust dough and made a very thin crust and baked it for about 5 minutes, then put on my toppings. I used Kalamata olives which really made the pizza!!! I also used grated Italian Blend Cheese (a blend of 5 cheeses) instead of the 3 cheeses mentioned.  Next time I will also add some roasted garlic and leave off the onion (personal preference). Nice and light pizza. Thanks! Made for my teammate for ZWT4."
1553454,49172,2012-02-17,4,"Made These today for the first time. Added garlic, parmesean cheese and  parsley as per other reviewer's suggestions. They tasted good and the texture was nice. Seemed though as though they could have used a little butter. Will definitely make again though and will try one person's idea of using buttermilk. Recipe is a keeper!!"
105111,41156,2005-05-16,5,My DH announced this was the best shortcake I have ever made!  Yeah!  I followed your recipe exactly and it was delicious.  It is a little sweeter than most shortcakes and the additional flavors of brown sugar and vanilla really make it stand out in the crowd.  Thanks for a really great shortcake! 
247802,9494,2005-10-11,5,They were really good and close to the real thing.  Even good reheated.
1710762,26947,2011-02-02,5,"This sauce was amazing! I bought 2 rotisserie chicken thighs from the deli for this, and 2 raw spare ribs from the butcher. Don't skimp on those two ""optional"" ingredients!"
424680,50707,2007-04-10,4,"An interesting cake from an easy-to-follow recipe! I was tempted to make this in a loaf pan [shades of banana bread!], but I didn't! The resulting cake was refreshingly mellow, & I did top it off with a simple date sauce that I make for ice cream, fruit, etc. This cake was well received after a very elaborate dinner! Many thanks for the recipe!"
152393,61704,2008-07-28,5,"Wow!  this turned out great.  I read all of the reviews and this is what I did:  Because many reviewers had trouble with the patties falling apart, I omitted the 2 tablespoons of water in the meat mixture.  (It seemed to do the trick)  I did,however add about 1/4 of a finely chopped onion to the meat.  I used milk instead of water in the sauce, added about 1 1/2 tablespoon of onion soup mix, another 1/4 chopped onion and about 1/2 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar to the sauce before simmering.  I served it with noodles and corn and both my DD and my DH raved about it.  Thanks Ang for sharing this easy new favorite."
571134,166364,2007-09-27,5,These were fantastic and it was such a filling meal! EVERYONE loved these. Comfort food at it's best. Thanks for sharing!
70662,47953,2009-02-13,4,"This cake was amazing!  The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because I thought there was too much cinnamon in the streusel topping and it overpowered everything else.  Next time (and there WILL be a next time!), I'll cut back to probably 1 tsp of cinnamon.

Like many reviewers, I cut cold butter into the streusel, rather than melting it.  My only other change to the recipe was to substitute half of the butter in the cake (1/4 cup) for unsweetened applesauce, just to make it a little healthier.  I don't think anyone would have known, though-- the cake was moist, rich, and very delicious!"
792538,57130,2009-01-06,5,"This is the ultimate pot roast, I browned the roast.  Mix the soup and onion mix added sherry in the pan where roast had been browned in."
486888,154133,2007-09-30,2,I had hoped that the sauce would've been pervasive throughout the dish but it really wasn't.  The meat didn't take on much of  the flavors and the sauce just didn't seem to be as full-bodied as I'd have hoped.  Perhaps as a crockpot recipe this would work better...also add a little more kick to it somehow.
778089,89204,2009-05-05,5,Love this - next time i would wait til last hour to add corn and beans - otherwise they were a little overdone. great recipe.  have passed this one on several times.
358445,137701,2006-10-01,5,"I thought this was excellent.  I omitted the bacon and used vegetable stock because I am a veggie.  My cheese was Danish Blue.  I also didn't have fresh sage, so I used some of the fresh rosemarry that I did have and it was very nce, just the right amount of creaminess.  It was a nice way to use leeks other than in soup.  It was easy to make and came out perfect!"
52427,37734,2003-01-13,5,Wonderful tuna wrap. I made these for my husband and I to take for lunch at work. I threw some chopped apples into the mix. Very easy and healthy too. Thanks for sharing this.
65502,472872,2012-02-16,5,"Absolutely FANTASTIC wings! I didn't have the chili garlic sauce so I used sweet Thai chili sauce. I have to admit that I didn't really watch the time, but I baked these on a baking sheet in the oven at 400F for about 15 minutes per side and then turned on the broiler to add some colour. Doing it this way, I just tossed the wings in all of the sauce and didn't baste. Loved the level of heat and simplicity of these wings. I will make these again for sure. And again. And... again! Made for PRMR tag game. Thanks Sharon123! :)"
1340934,291498,2009-11-07,5,"Can I just say - THANK YOU! I was planning on making something yummy for my dad tomorrow and it was a toss up between these and some cupcakes on another site. I went with the cupcakes, and ended up with 12 tasteless hockey pucks and a bit of a broken spirit. I decided to go with these muffins after chucking the others away. It's now 9:22pm and these banana muffins are in the oven - and they look AMAZING! You totally saved me with this recipe as I was out of butter and it's hard to come across a good baking recipe without it. 
Thank you thank you! I shoulda just made these from the start, they look great."
20480,84617,2007-05-08,5,I've been wanting to post this recipe since I used to make this all the time. We give at least 5 stars; it's one of our family favourites. Thanks for posting.
192849,30524,2006-05-30,5,Excellent marinade.  I bought eye of round 2 inch steaks for a memorial day cookout and wanted them as tender as possible.  I marinated them in this for 8 hours prior to grilling.  They were melt in your mouth tender and had a wonderful flavor.  Happy that a less expensive cut of meat came out so great!
285039,459482,2013-04-27,5,"Very nice alternative to a regular burger.  Served additional crispy onions on the side, and will definitely make these again!"
400708,228738,2011-09-06,5,"I cannot believe I forgot to get a photo of this, it was so awesome with great flavors.  I'd never heard of anything like it before but decided to add it to our 4th of July party and it was a hit with everyone.  I followed another reviewers suggestions on putting together in a pyrex bowl - then layering and it not only tasted great but looked so impressive.  I think I might even use a tomatillo and maybe a jalapeno to the mix next time.  <br/><br/>As an update, I had the company over again and decided to repeat this awesome recipe just so I could get a picture.  It was again a hit with everyone."
985030,140987,2008-10-11,0,I'm making these for New Years party... They look great! Thanks!
2001735371,145312,2017-09-30,0,"The sugar free yellow cake mix, plain, comes out at 4pt/muffin, based on making 24. Where in the world are people getting 1 or 2 points? I am getting ready to make these, and aside from the pumpkin, I am SHOCKED at the points!"
2001768319,6569,2017-10-27,0,"I've been making this dish since 1993. Best pasta dish ever. I have made it for many friends and family since then. I get many requests at get-togethers as it is known as one of my signature dishes. I like the heat, but many in my circle have a hard time with it. The dish is still quite good even when cutting the cayenne back by 1/2 or even 3/4."
440735,65538,2011-03-21,0,It needs more spice.  I added an additional tsp of cumin plus a can of green chili's instead of the jalapeno peppers. Easy and good.
118163,238039,2007-07-11,5,"I made this with a loaf of challah bread that surprisingly was just not getting eaten in my house. I sliced in myself into the 18 slices you need for this dish, and dried them in the oven. The challah bread added a great touch to this recipe I think and also gave it a rustic look. The flavor was like creamy apple pie. I didn't even use the maple syrup that was suggested. I just sifted a little powdered sugar, and it was plenty sweet enough with that. The only problem with this is that it is very filling, and I could only eat a small portion. I also wasn't hungary for 6 hours after that. lol. All and all, this was a great recipe. Something that I will probably make again Christmas morning to start the day off right. Thank you for a great one!"
2946498,505642,2013-08-16,5,Liv - This is AMAZING!   My son wanted to know how you made it taste like pie when he couldn&#039;t find any crust in it (his favorite part normally).  Thanks for a super delicious treat!
724593,138239,2008-05-30,5,I used bottom of the round roast for this instead of the chuck. I rolled the meat in flour before frying to later help thicken the gravy.  Also I used regular wide egg noodles as I couldn't find the frozen ones.  Outstanding dinner that sticks to your ribs!
13483,121882,2005-06-23,5,"I kind of screwed up on these in that I added almost double the amount of milk.  As a result I got a lot more ""lite"" muffins.  They are good though.  "
1105991,200296,2009-01-17,5,"YUM!!! This was great! My family loved this. It's a keeper!!! Thanks, Kittencal for a really easy, yummy recipe. I marinated my chicken in the dressing for an hour or so and I used Keebler Club crackers to make the crumbs. I added twice as much garlic plus a bunch of onion powder.  I only used 2Tbsp. of butter and it was plenty.  My oven temp was 475.  I have another recipe that's baked like this and that's the temp called for in that one and it always turns out good so I knew I had to use 475 for this one too.  They took about 30 minutes and were perfect. I can't wait to try more of your recipes, Kittencal."
424680,218207,2007-04-01,5,"OK, OK, so I took the 'Southwestern' right out of this recipe [or NEARLY so!], since I cut the amount of chiles in half! Still, I was very happy with the results, & this corn pudding recips will now be included with several others of my own! [Are you aware that SOME people have never even tasted corn pudding, much less know what it is!]"
39835,211671,2008-06-07,4,"Very good and easy to make salad which we enjoyed with grilled fish! This makes a lot of salad, so I am planning on draining off the excess liquid and have it again for dinner tonight with grilled chicken. Thanks for sharing!"
400708,87775,2008-03-26,5,"Made this for our Easter Brunch and it turned out wonderful.  Well worth the effort to put it together.  I made one braided and one basket with the red egg in the center.  I didn't have almonds so used pecans and the Anise seet has I didn't have mahlepi or the masticha, also followed another reviewers comments and used TWO egg yolks for the glaze.  It was wonderful with a slight anise flavor and the background of orange.  It was enjoyed by all and I was so proud of the outcome.  Thanks Evelyn for another great recipe and helping me to look so impressive."
199848,89832,2006-08-11,5,"This is a simple and tasty side dish.  It's a great combination .  The fish sauce really does add lots of flavor.  I read the previous reviews and only used 1/4 cup of chicken stock, and that seemed to be just enough.  I will make this again; thanx!"
65502,116849,2009-01-07,5,"Wow! Kittencal has the best recipe for Caesar Salad by far. I made Kittencal's Garlic Croutons for this recipe too. I couldn't stop tasting this dressing before and after we had it for Thanksgiving. My Mother tried it and said that it reminded her of a caesar salad that she used to get years ago and hadn't tasted anything so amazing since. Until this! I made the recipe note for note and used fresh parmesan cheese. I chose to use milk instead of cream and low fat mayo as suggested. The dressing was unbelievably rich and tasty and a perfect balance of garlic, anchovies, etc. Thanks again!"
165899,85148,2004-11-03,5,"These were great, and so easy!  I added some garlic powder and basil, but not much.  I think next time I'll give them another couple of minutes in the oven - after 20 mins they were still just a touch ""moist"" in the middle (but still great!). "
428885,70093,2007-03-06,5,"This recipe falls well within the lacto-ovo vegetarian confines. I was able to make this recipe vegan, by using 3 substitutions: egg/replacer for eggs, Silkin tofu for cottage cheese, and vegetable margarine for butter. I did add a bit of seasoned salt, a pinch of red peppers flakes, and ground pepper. The taste was terrific, even for those that aren't anything but carnivores. Thanks Rachel!"
409726,140093,2006-12-17,5,"I really thought I had done something wrong because the dough was extremely crumbly and dry.  It was hard to roll it into a 9"" log since it kept falling apart.  But the final product turned out great!  I did not realize this was a Mexican-wedding cookie-esque recipe.  I am so glad I didn't give up.  These will definitely be a staple recipe for me from now on.  Thanks!"
1375556,22782,2010-01-12,5,And I though MY sauce was good!? This was the best I've ever tasted. Thanks so much!!
116371,72605,2004-03-29,5,Wish I could give this one more than 5 stars!  These are so delicious.  And easy too.  They taste just like they came from a bakery or coffehouse.  Definitely in my pile for Christmas cookies!
226863,149438,2013-02-21,5,"Really enjoyed this soup!  I have made a version of this for years,but this is the first time I've put savory in it.  Due to personal preference, I left the potatoes out.  I left everything else the same.  Perfect on a cool evening! Thanks for sharing!"
227652,180334,2009-03-23,5,"I cannot thank you enough for this recipe, and to Parsley for the wonderful stovetop method! It was so simple, flavorful & my husband absolutely loved it. I used whole wheat elbow macaroni, no peppers or mushrooms, lean ground turkey & low fat cheese. For the ""toppings,"" I used turkey pepperoni & tons of olives-but the options are endless. I cook vegetarian for myself now & my husband has missed lasagna-like meat dishes. This saved the day & I am sure I will make this for him again & again. Thanks again!!"
199848,468270,2012-05-09,5,"This soup is thick and yummy.  It really fills you up, too.  I made this just as written and thought it was perfect.  I garnished the soup with crumbled queso fresco, fresh cilantro and chopped red onions.  Thanx for posting!"
203111,152553,2006-10-26,4,"Amazing!  I couldn't believe this could actually be good, so I tried it out of curiosity. Made 1/2 the recipe using only 1 egg, also cut the amount of sage by 1/2 again. How surprised I am at how good it was!  Thanks, snicklefritz!   "
2000424783,99023,2015-08-23,4,"It tastes pretty vinegary.   Add 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of bourbon. 
Now we&#039;re talking."
44589,2886,2004-05-06,5,"Mmmmmm...this is got to be the best banana bread recipe ever! I had found one previously that was pretty good...but I didn't have any creme de freshe that the recipe called for. So I can online to look for a good recipe...and I think I've found it!! Uses all the basic ingredients, but the results are incredible! The only thinkthat I did differently was use brown sugar instead of white sugar. But just remeber that if you are using overly ripe bananas...like I did, minimize the amount of sugar because it was a bit too sweet. Other than that, theres no complaints from me! Tomorrow I am going to be making four loaves. Two to keep at home and two to bring to a party/potluck thing I am going to!! Definately a keeper! :)"
217898,323112,2010-03-10,5,"This was a very good recipe.    I tweaked it to suit our family's tastes.    I subbed regular Splenda for 1/2 of the brown sugar.    I added a teaspoon and a half of orange zest, grated 1/4 tsp of fresh nutmeg, one teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of fresh ginger into the raisin mixture.     I may have simmered it too long or it may have been the Splenda, but when I added the wet to the dry ingredients, I had to add 1/4 cup of prune puree to make the dough doughy enough to be workable.   I also added a splash of vanilla to the cake itself after I mixed everything and a teaspoon of cinnamon followed with some grated nutmeg.     I put this into a sprayed bundt pan, and just had the first taste, it is sweet, and not too heavy, just a really nice light flavor.    I put a spray of whipped cream on the top.    Thanks so much for posting, I'll be making this again!!!"
195969,87085,2005-12-13,5,This was a great recipe and pretty easy to make. Thanks
137231,50338,2005-08-29,3,I found this soup to be very bland.  Next time I'll use tomatoes with chilies if I decide to make it again.  I much prefer the 5 cans and a jar soup.
45900997,153891,2014-01-29,4,"My family has been frying cauliflower for close to 100 years so I would make several suggestions. Cut the cauliflower into tennis ball size chunks. Steam until a fork will barely go in. Cool quickly, you don&#039;t want mushy cauliflower. Mix eggs with a cup of milk. Dip in caulf. and roll in flour seasoned with salt, pepper, cayenne. Fry in hot oil. Serve while still hot. Small children will think it&#039;s fried chicken and ask for more."
18551,17985,2002-11-26,5,"Fantabulous!  I made these today, and made 'half' the recipe (got 27 cookies).  I like a wide variety of cookies, so making half recipes works for me.  They are totally delicious, easy to make.. and the 350 deg. oven worked just fine for me.. took about 14-15 min.  Thanks a bunch .. this will be one of my most often made!"
277462,120413,2006-02-05,3,"I thought these were just so-so.  They were more like bbq chicken than hot wings, barely any heat at all.  We did eat them, liked the flavor, but not the wing taste we were looking for."
508312,26165,2009-01-27,3,"This frosting is delicious, but I haven't yet managed to get it thick enough.  :-("
99415,145312,2008-02-25,5,"These are fantastic! I followed it exactly to the recipe, except I filled the muffin cups to the top (I like them BIG) and got about 14 out of the mix. Soo good... and so easy to make. You definitely can't tell they are low in fat!!"
1828407,397049,2014-05-16,5,"I thought this was great and my family really liked it.  I also used the small red, yellow, and orange bell peppers because that was what I had on hand.  It went together fast and with minimal mess.  I will definitely make this again!"
1306576,87864,2010-10-30,4,"These were delicious and rich - the peanut butter topping was so good I had to restrain myself from eating it instead of putting it on the brownie!<br/>One thing I did find with it, and the reason I'm giving it four instead of five stars, was that the brownie part was tricky. It stuck to my pan like superglue the first time, despite the pan being greased, and even when I did it with parchment paper the second time it was still sticky. I also had to bake it for 30 minutes or so (definitely past what they said) because though the recipe warns not to overbake, mine was still gooey inside at 25 minutes. Otherwise, the taste is amazing."
594139,220465,2008-10-30,5,We loved these I served them with Chef floWer Recipe#221217 and with her suggestion of Recipe#36126. It was an absolutely delicious meal and the whole family agreed. I made them a little fatter as I was serving as a main meal so it made for a little quicker preparation. I would definitely make these as finger foods at a party they would go down a treat. I made them with chicken and I know now after tasting this would definitely be my preference over beef. Thanks for another great recipe Chef floWer.
2216717,166891,2013-02-05,5,"Excellent lemon loaf.  Just like my Canadian Mum used to make......I used 3 mini (disposable aluminum type) loaf pans and placed them on a cookie sheet to bake for about 38 to 40 minutes.  I lined each pan with parchment paper to make removing the loaves easy.  I also substituted granulated sugar in the glaze, heating in the microwave to dissolve.  Thanks so much for the recipe, Recipe Junkie.  :)<br/><br/>Update:  Just a note for anyone else making the same mistake I did.....We didn't notice anything ""off"" while the bread was still warm, but when it cooled it had an awful metallic after taste.  After some research I realize using Clapper Girl baking powder was the culprit.  It has aluminum in it and that's what we were tasting.  I'm switching to Rumford double action powder from now on. :)"
266635,438046,2011-11-28,5,"Thanks for a great smoothie!  I used vanilla yogurt vs. the plain yogurt and truvia sweetener along with a little honey.  This is a great breakfast drink, but would be good any time of the day.  So easy to make and so delicious!  Made for the AUS/NZ Make My Recipe tag, November, 2011."
2001837568,88364,2017-12-03,0,Absolutely Devine.....no kidding....I love my martinis......but this is a special treat.....from time to time
320870,257962,2008-05-09,4,"This was really good!  Instead of layering as is directed I chopped the egg and mixed it with dressing and had an ""egg salad"" sandwich.  I would also decrease the amount of mustard a tad next time.  I also added a dash of hot sauce."
522099,219473,2007-07-01,4,"quick is right and it puts the ""yum"" in Tom Yum.  Very close to the Thai restaurant here in town and much faster (cheaper too!)."
2398005,8424,2012-09-11,0,Best apple pie I have ever made. Only change was to add a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch to the apple mixture to thicken the sauce. I also brushed a good quantity of caramel sauce (ce cream topping) over the crust 1/2 way through baking.
223979,169922,2006-06-13,5,"This is wonderful!  I did not do the pretty presentation.  I  put the sprinkle on, then a little cream and cherry sauce on top.  Thanks for a great dessert!"
1577560,120587,2016-03-06,5,I&#039;ve made this simple pheasant dish a couple of times now with no additions or alterations and have been so pleased with the result.  The simplicity of the dish allows you to really encounter the flavor of the pheasant making this recipe ideal for a very fresh bird.
1288397,48356,2009-06-06,5,Just made these and they are the best cookies ever.  Hubby said they are the best ones I have ever made... would recommend to everyone... love it!!!!
502302,291125,2009-09-14,0,This is pretty close to what we make. Hubby got an authentic recipe from a Mexican. He fillets the meat really thin first and uses more orange juice than your recipe (omits the tequila but sometimes adds rum). He slices onions in rings and layers the meat with onions and marinade.
26341,834,2002-02-08,3,"While the meat came out VERY moist, I found that doubling the sauce still wasn't enough; perhaps garlic the next time, and a bit more Worchesteshire sauce to lemon."
32143,87085,2006-09-16,5,"Really good! I love how quick and easy this is. I only used about half of a small onion and green pepper (family preference), and a cheddar jack cheese blend. Served with green beans and crescent rolls. Yum!"
378624,86772,2007-05-12,5,"Yum!  I loved this dish!  I've never had okra before but after watching Paula Deen use okra a few times, I decided to buy a bag.  I didn't get to use it until now... I made some coconut milk rice and read that spicy okra went well with it.  
I did make some changes.  Instead of diced tomatoes, I used salsa and instead of habanero peppers, I used 3 pieces of Korean dried peppers.  I love spicy food and with the salsa & korean peppers, this dish was hot! =)  Thanks!"
1611437,22841,2016-04-21,4,"I followed the ingredient directions and took the feedback of others on the cooking... I pre-boiled for 1 hr, then marinated overnight, then cooked for 1 hr in the marinade at 350F, basting twice.  The flavor was very good, not too thyme-y for me, as I love thyme... it was too saucey though.  Next time I will do everything the same up to the point of cooking... I will scrape/pat off the marinade and cook them &quot;dry&quot; in foil."
340583,120846,2007-07-09,5,"I loved making this cake. It was so easy to combine the milk & butter this way.I substituted skim lactaid milk for the regular & omitted the sugar on the top. It was light & had wonderful flavor. I am going to try it with some lemon zest next time.    Loved it.
I also substituted 1/2 tablespoon cardamon for the mace.   
It is definitely 5 stars."
2206542,27520,2012-03-09,0,"Pretty good! This recipe is so versatile! I give it a bit more 'umph' with Italian seasoning, a can of tom paste and sometimes add whole kernel corn. Sometimes add dried red pepper as well.  Have cooked it, dumped into a casserole dish, topped with an Italian cheese blend and baked for a few minutes (just long enough to melt the cheese)!"
2206637,437114,2012-05-11,5,Amazing!  I was looking for an interesting way to use the fake crab and boy is this a jackpot!  I added extra amounts of the said spices and did panko bread crumbs on the outside of the patties like another review said~~~ Loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe!
804931,88880,2008-05-12,5,I knew I would really like these aspaaragus because I love Feta and lemon anything.  These were no exception.  Just the right amount of everything.  Loved the addition of the red pepper flakes which added a new dimension altogether.  Great recipe!
57042,128797,2007-02-21,5,I gave this 5 stars. My family loves cucumber sandwiches. We make ours slightly different. We do not use onions or cut out the bread. We spread 2 slices of white bread with mayonnaise. Then lay slices of cucumbers onto one slice of bread. Next we sprinkle with salt & pepper and top the with the other slice of bread. Thanks for posting a great recipe! Christine (internetnut)
349769,124105,2006-09-06,3,I have been looking for this. It is simple and good.
55974,40993,2002-09-25,0,"My wife did this recipe when we were posted in Doha, Qatar in the Middle East and it is delicious. We gave two of these cakes to some British friends and they consumed both for breakfast. The fruit has a lovely brandy odor when fermenting.

690623,207599,2017-08-20,5,"Hum, I reviewed this yesterday but it must have come unglued :) This was an easy, tasty and refreshing salad to have with the Indian meal I had made. I think it would be brilliant with fish too! Mad for CQ4"
116518,234147,2009-10-02,5,We love this recipe at our house!  I use shredded chicken instead of beef and it is wonderful.  Now I am going to try using it in my OAMC menu.  Thanks!!
1802872853,140062,2015-05-11,5,So simple and delicious!  I used a silicone bowl cover to keep the moisture in-they work so great especially in the microwave. Thank You!
42023,39102,2002-10-03,4,I have indeed been to many an Adventist potluck dinner. This is very close to my own recipe. I usually use walnuts instead of pecans though. I think next time I'll try the pecans. Thanks.
15417,238540,2008-01-08,2,"Very thick, and slightly bitter.  Although, I loved how easy it was to prepare."
695933,24164,2012-07-15,5,"Before attempting this again, I have read all of the review and I'll will figure out what seasonings, that will work for me, to make it more flavorful or lot better for me to do! Anyway, excellent to do a SCRATCH on recipes. The more I play with my food, the more I love to cooking to make a recipe that will work for me, that is!! Than I can do the happy food dance!! This is real good as is I got to play with more food now. THANK YOU!! 5 Stars"
207176,144258,2007-04-03,5,"I have made soup like this many times but I always have to refer to a recipe, so tonight I chose yours! I liked that you put the water measurement in cups (not quarts), which is easy since I used a large measuring cup. I made only a few changes: no turnip, added a bay leaf and peppercorns to a tea infuser ball and used 2 1/2 tsp. of salt. I also added 3 chicken bouillon cubes. Once the soup was finished, I strained it and put in a few pieces of chicken (and reserved the rest of the chicken for a curry chicken spread). I poured the soup into separate quart containers cool them in the refrigerator to let the fat harden for easy removal. I am making matzo balls from a mix now and will add those to the soup once they cool down. The soup is very delicious- I have made it many times and this is the recipe I will use from now on.  It just got RAVE reviews at my seder from real chicken soup experts. Thank you! Everyone said it was the BEST I ever made! Thanks Kishka!"
130819,221952,2008-12-09,5,Made for awesome chicken. We love chicken - add those lovely ingredients and it's a winner at our house! Made as posted - didn't have bamboo shoots;  found the suggested bean sprouts worked really well as did using chicken stock. Have to make this for my family - only change needed next time around .. is to double the recipe!  Thank you for a recipe that made for a great evening meal.
629920,67256,2008-07-14,3,"I almost feel guilty only giving this recipe 3 stars. It just taste like banana nut bread with frosting, period. Nothing exceptional, just your  basic  banana bread. Though it is a good recipe,  I was very disappointed."
2807561,287101,2013-05-05,3,I am new to baking with stevia and I had high hopes for this recipe.  I was slightly let down.  The crust was great but the filling was a bit off.  The texture was crumbly not smooth; even the color of the cheese cake was different (more white).  I will make this again but will play around with the ingredients in hopes of a better result.  I did use three whole eggs but this even seems like not enough eggs when comparing to other cheesecake recipes.
169969,129844,2005-07-18,5,"Excellent Sandwich! I have saved it in my Lunch Box Cookbook! Great Flavor and traveles well!!! thank you for posting!
"
117221,10744,2006-10-31,5,WOW!!!!!!  This is the best chicken pot pie DH and I have ever had.  I love that it doesn't use a can of cream of chicken soup!!  I did leave out the onion.  I froze half the filling for another night since it's just the two of us.  Great recipe!!  Thanks for a keeper!  I'm telling everyone about it too!
21487,39808,2003-02-05,5,"Being a bourbon drinker, I just ""happened"" to have some on hand so this recipe caught my eye! I used chicken tenders instead and true to form ""had"" to add some fresh garlic. I served this over dirty rice with hot sour dough bread. Very nice and easy recpe."
583409,113917,2009-09-14,2,"The chicken was very moist,but no flavor, the rice seemed over cooked (by cooking it 25 min covered under a low simmer)..the pineapple also did nothing to add to the flavor."
13483,12447,2001-12-04,5,"This does make a lot.  I added garlic and onion initially and cooked peas and carrots at the end to make a stew/soup.  Got 3 meals for 2 from it.  1st a soup in a bowl with buns and salad
2nd deboned and shredded chicken, thickened liquid with cornstarch and soy sauce and served over rice with tortilla and salsa
3rd over toast with veggies
Loved it."
2041603,4627,2011-10-27,5,"Yum! We reduced the onion, omitted the celery and used vegetable oil. Very tasty soup with cheese and chips!"
347233,108105,2008-01-22,5,"This recipe is SO YUMMY. I love the flavour and the peas just make it so fresh and yummy.

100811,326087,2008-09-23,5,This was a great recipe. But in my kitchen I used chicken broth instead of wine. Also added sliced red peppers and mushrooms when frying the onions. Served with mashed potatoes. A very easy and tasty recipe when unexpected company is standing at the door. Thanks.
318235,155381,2010-04-29,4,This recipe was very good. The lavender flavor was subtle but the aroma was wonderful. Thank you.
9869,15070,2005-08-07,4,"This was a nice soup..although I was a little confused with the ingredients..in the directions it mentions to add the water, although no amount is given in the ingredients (I used enough to cover the carrots and cabbage) and then in the ingredients it mentions two 1/4 cup amounts of sugar (I only used 2 Tablespoons in total)
I also added 2 tsps minced garlic and added salt and pepper.
I used 1 and a half litres of tomato juice.
Served with some crusty buttered bread rolls."
215922,98724,2005-06-22,5,Ironically I just finished tying my tomato plants to their respective stakes in the garden. Your recipe reminded me why I work so hard in the garden all summer. Nothing beats a tomato sandwich with a tomato picked fresh from the garden.  Add a little fresh basil and ground pepper for an added treat. 
630176,31919,2007-10-28,5,"This is exactly the recipe I was looking for. Honeycrisp apples are in season - They are the best apples ever!!! I skipped steps #7-10.
They were SOOO GOOD !!!! I made extra stuffing and put that in and around the pork chops and added extra broth so it would not dry out. The chops were tender and the stuffing was YUMMY !!!!! I will be making these again. Thank you  Suellen for sharing your recipe"
213652,32614,2012-03-24,5,"Love! The last pan is about to go in the oven, and all I can say is yummy! I rolled them all and then sugared before putting on the pan. I had no problems with disappearing sugar."
137302,475216,2013-04-06,4,This was pretty good but I think it would have been better with less or little mustard.  I used yellow mustard since I don&#039;t care for the spicier mustard in the recipes.  I think that the mustard with the lemon juice and the vinegar was just a little too acidic for my taste.  I think if I make it again I will put only a small amount of mustard in the marinade or maybe none at all.  Made for PAC Spring 2013.
1785525,53519,2011-01-04,0,"Yes I experienced what someone said making a large cake the center remains uncooked. This is my second time making this recipe and now I put the mixture in 2 - 9 inch pans it is in the oven I hope it comes out great. I also reduced the oil to 1 1/8 and added 1 cup of sour cream. So lets see how it taste. I also agree that .3 red coloring is not enough - the cake needs to look ""red"" like its name!"
232107,10123,2009-02-08,5,Wonderful! Didn't have the instant vanilla pudding so I used bannana and they were delish!! Thanks
149363,194000,2007-05-26,5,"I chose this recipe to make in memory of Amy. Wow, what a terrific, simple recipe. Well written, easy to follow instructions make this a great recipe for a flavourful meal my whole family enjoyed! Love you Amy!"
2001951155,525677,2018-01-24,1,"I just made this dish last weekend for the family. No one liked it, including me. The lime juice gives the entire dish an off putting sour taste. I might make it again, but without any limes and/or lime juice, and I would increase the honey to 1 tablespoon."
646093,78009,2008-06-02,4,"I thought these turned out pretty good. Though I did make several changes: sub 1/4 C applesauce for half the butter; used 1/2 C granulated sugar and 1/4 C brown; 1 C whole wheat flour and 1/2 C ap, plus a little baking powder to help with the lower gluten content of whole wheat; lots more cinnamon, as well as a little nutmeg and cloves (I like spice, hehe); I only had old fashioned oats, so I just whirled them in my Magic Bullet for a couple seconds to give them the right texture. I also did not use nuts, and only had chocolate chips (which I didn't measure - never do). While that seems like a ton of changes, I feel that it was still the same basic cookie, and I did like it. Though I must say that after eating some of the batter (I'm awful like that with cookies), I was kind of disappointed in the flavor of the final product. It seemed to have lost some of the flavor while baking. But they are a bit better the next day. Thank you for something new to try out! UPDATE: I just pulled a few of these out of the freezer, and must say that they freeze very well. Either let them thaw on their own for a few hours, or pop them in the microwave for ten seconds or so, and they are still great!"
865936,348566,2010-02-11,4,"What a great idea for a spice rub!  At first I thought it tasted weird, but by the second bite, it was delicious.  I didn't follow the cooking directions, however.  I cooked a 4 lb roast at 450 for 15 minutes, then turned it down to 325 until an internal meat thermometer registered 122 degrees.  I then removed it from the oven and let it sit for 30 minutes.  Perfectly, medium rare and juicy."
2378928,311951,2012-08-27,0,Yummy! Love this smoothie and will be making it again!
426664,88939,2009-09-14,5,I have made this 3 times in 3 weeks. My family said that's the only way they want grilled chicken for now on. It is so good! I add a tsp. of dijon mustard and use fresh garlic.
88378,64878,2013-07-08,4,"I slightly increased the Bisquick, milk and eggs in order to make this a deep dish pie and feed 5 of us.  I sauteed finely chopped orange bell pepper, purple onion and garlic in a small amount of olive oil before adding to the pie plate, along with a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and lots of fresh parsley.  Went well with the ham and Swiss.  I also added some Tabasco.  Without these flavor enhancers, I think the pie would be a tad dull.  Everyone thought it was quite good and it&#039;s a nice recipe to build upon.  We thought it made for a great dinner, along with green beans and potato salad."
597071,165950,2010-06-03,5,I love this recipe! I've made it a bunch of times and it's SO easy. It's a good one to take to a potluck and is always a favorite. I sometimes add chopped walnuts to the cake mix and serve along side of french vanilla ice cream.
526666,395852,2010-05-25,5,"These were enjoyable; I was kinda surprised! I never thought the idea of meat and potatoes mixed together was appealing, but these looked good! And they were! I did reduce the recipe for 2, and followed as written. I sprinkled cheddar on top, before baking for 15 minutes, and they were crusty and tasty! Thanks for sharing, gailanng. Made for ZWT 6."
664214,39087,2008-11-24,5,"Wow! The parmesan is a must, it makes it sooo rich and cheesy! I may consider adding asagio as well next time. I made this for my boyfriend's birthday, he LOVES pasta, especially creamy chicken pasta. Very simple, quick, and wonderful flavoring. We did not find it too salty at all as the other reviewers did, and I used the only cajun spice I could fine in good old Eastern Alberta, Canada haha...I would add more Cajun spice next time, and maybe some fresh tomatoes along with the dried to meld the flavors better...phenomenal recipe though!! Thank you !"
137050,266834,2008-06-24,5,"This was an excellent dish to serve at my backyard cookout.  Early in the day, I boiled my potatoes and rubbed my chicken so everything was ready for the grill at the same time. Make sure your chicken has been patted dry with a paper towel before putting the rub on; otherwise you will get too mcuh of the mixture on the chicken.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  Made for My 3 Chefs June 2008."
179757,111777,2006-08-30,5,"This is a very goog pot pie recipe. I made it with a biscuit topping as opposed to pie crust, and also added some leeks and garlic to the onions. The filling was very good, just the right consistencyeveryone from husband to 2 year old loved it. It is a keeper. Thanks Charmie."
59780,129197,2005-08-20,5,"These are so delicious! I made these for your ""I broke my camera"" cookathon and I am sure glad that I did! I mixed up on the directions and used an 8 inch pan, but they were still good. Even DH liked these and I may have to fight him for the extras that I have in the freezer :) I have added this to my OAMC collection, thanks!"
139123,13492,2004-06-03,4,"Very delicious! I added steak seasoning which added a very strong kick! Very impressive looking with a variety of red, yellow, orange and green peppers.  Also, I cut the tops off and used them as lids for an over-the-top presentation!  Thanks!"
1623447,170036,2012-09-02,5,"Delicious, moist, banana-y cookies just right for tempting my daughter's little taste buds. I did reduce the sugar to 2/3 cup as I thought 1 cup was quite a lot for my very ripe bananas. I can't imagine it made a difference to the overall taste or texture. Thank you for sharing."
250804,64914,2007-11-09,5,"I have been meaning to review this for some time. This is now My Favorite Chili.  I only made one change, I don't like dark beer light beer worked just as well."
56112,38966,2004-04-21,5,"Quick, simple and delish yellow cake mix.  This one is a keeper.  Wouldn't change a thing."
2725533,83624,2014-12-31,5,"I thought it&#039;d be too sweet but it&#039;s totally fantastic. I cook Asian food on a regular basis and this is perfect. Pho, Thai, Indonesian...serious Asian. Again this is great. Used grated ginger. Thank you!"
87236,221429,2018-03-28,5,I can't believe I never reviewed this recipe! It has been my go-to wholewheat bread recipe for years now and it always comes out well and its freshness lasts for days! Thanks for sharing!
102058,290090,2008-06-30,4,"YUM! I am not usually a huge fan of breakfast cereal  but I like fresh fruit and yogurt so made off with some of DH's Bran Flakes and YUM, surprised myself LOL.  This was refreshing and definiately filling so once you have had this for breakfast it's easier to avoid the mid morning munchies. Please see my Rating System: 4 excellent stars for a very tastey, healthy and filling way to start the day.. one I am now tempted to try more often.  Thanks!"
9869,150802,2006-12-02,5,"Well all I can say is thank you very much for posting this recipe, Ive always had troubles roasting potatoes, not any more!!
Easy to follow directions with a wonderful end result. Thanks for sharing."
186527,85006,2005-01-10,4,Excellent dish for a winter evening. It was my first time cooking with scallops and this recipe turned out delicious. Thank you!
431499,117532,2013-10-31,0,This was easy and made a great crust. My family loved it. We&#039;ll use it over and over!
2001937889,66703,2018-07-17,5,"Turned out great, family was excited to see homemade PB cookies again. I made a double batch and added 1.5 cups salted peanuts and skipped the rolling in sugar. I still pressed them down a little before popping into the oven, Cooked them for just 13 minutes to leave a little tenderness in the middle, - will be using this recipe again, and again, , ,"
1090410,333164,2008-12-30,5,Definitely overflowing with flavor and healthy too!  Ended up doubling the sauces because we added extra veggies which I think was important.
22788,74377,2005-02-05,5,"This Shepherd's Pie is a keeper for me. It held together so you could neatly serve it in squares and yet remain very moist and flavorfully. I went with the Cream of Mushroom soup as the binder to hold it all together. Because we have to watch our salt intake, I replaced the garlic salt with a garlic powder, salt & pepper blend that I use, and I only used about a teaspoon... maybe a touch more. I had a package of shredded cheddar, so that is the cheese I used to top it all off. Incidently, I made only half of the recipe and baked it in a 8""x8"" casserole dish. Thanks for a new way to make our Shepard's Pie...I love variety."
358016,71169,2006-09-30,5,"leah, hi this is connie, i really enjoyed your recipe"
312338,17394,2006-10-23,4,"The juice was really high in the pan, so I pierced the meat on the bottom in various places so that it would soak in somewhat.  I cooked this for an hour and 15 minutes, but it was still really pink on the inside. I'm sure it was ""done"" by health standards, but I'm just not a fan of pink ground beef.  We just threw the slices into a hot skillet, though, to finish them off and the taste was outstanding!  I guess next time I'll just cook mine longer."
1800338091,488222,2013-11-27,5,it was fun to make ....and everyone like them ...big hit for the dinner ...love it
439066,59387,2008-01-03,5,"I wasn't going to rate this since I made quite a few changes - but it was just SO good! For one, we just made the sauce. We didn't have coconut milk - so we pureed regular milk with coconut flakes, strained it, and added some coconut extract (turned out great!). Also, we didn't have any jalapenos - so we just left them out. Then we mixed in some veggies and tossed it with rotini. Served it with my Spicy Orange Shrimp (Recipe #265683), and it was a great spicy/creamy combo! Thanks for this recipe, I'll definitely use it again with the shrimp."
650039,302294,2008-05-10,4,Made this tonight. Didn't use coconut or the rum because of my husband's diet. I did add a small amount of sugar. My hubby loved it. He said to double the batch next time. Thank you for the recipe.
85730,79378,2005-05-24,5,Simple and tasty.  My blender didn't really like so much ice but I coaxed it into cooperation.
747477,139372,2009-10-27,5,So good!
1074602,107072,2008-12-14,5,This recipe was so delicious! I'm not sure I'll be able to eat ginger beef at a restaurant ever again!
865936,321803,2014-03-16,4,"This came out great just as written!  I thought the recipe had a lot of sugar, but that made the syrup from the fruit nice and chewy, like candy.  I used canned cherries and was uncertain how much of the syrup to use.  I used individual ramekins and spooned the cherries evenly over the batter.  Then I spooned the syrup over until the batter was pretty much covered.  I probably only used about half the syrup in the can.  I think peaches and other fruits normally have far less syrup in their cans if I recall.  Well anyway, my cobblers were not at all dry and they were great.  Just wish comfort food wasn&#039;t so unhealthy!"
351811,215620,2007-04-23,5,"This recipes deserves more than 5 stars! where's the button ;) very smooth and creamy combo. I loved the Kahlua, Godiva and Cinnamon schnapps together. topped with whip cream... what a dreamy wonderful cocktail. More like dessert with a kick. Thanks for sharing another great drink BK. Cheers ~V"
833434,95246,2009-04-19,5,"i made these vegetarian by using a full package of yves breakfast sausages run through the food processor. i don't like parsley so i used dill instead and chipotle pepper rather then normal. made as 1/3 recipe since i only had 1 pkg of puff pastry. i also added about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar. filling was too crumbly so i added some extra milk to make it hold together and cut each roll in thirds to be a reasonable size for grab-and-go breakfasts. forgot all about the egg wash but this pastry holds together well and browns without it. ended up being a lot of filling for my two pastry sheets. since nothing but the onion and dough needed cooking i did the second half at 375f instead of 400f. just realized i missed the word ""halved"" for the pastry sheets but oh well. doesn't even need dipping in anything. very tasty!"
1753159,17927,2010-12-06,5,"I made this the other night for my husband, our oven didn't cook it all the way in the hour it stated but when he got to the edge, he said it tasted just like Juniors. Next time I will do a graham cracker crust and leave it in longer. Overall best cheesecake I have ever had, plus my picky father-in-law had 3 pieces!"
1127431,461147,2011-10-03,5,"so quick and easy, yet absolutely delicious! made exactly as is,no need to tamper with perfection."
429769,92174,2012-08-25,5,"Very simple and delicious. I have never made chipped beef and wanted to find a recipe to use up extra steak or roast. This worked fine. Since I did not use packaged chipped beef, I just salted to taste. Good recipe. Will use as a regular."
140132,38413,2011-01-29,4,"I made this the other night for our supper and we enjoyed it very much.  I didn't have plain yogurt so I subbed in vanilla flavored instead and it was wondrful.  Thank you for sharing, this easy dressing for fruit.  DD was dipping her apple slices in it the next day."
2001836906,282598,2017-12-16,5,Another great recipe on this site. I made this the other night and it was a hit! :)
6357,66755,2003-08-01,5,"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!! Gosh, splendid!!! You know what, I love everything about this recipe: Its sooooo easy to fix, it tastes so good(fit for a king or queen), smells hauntingly tempting and the colour is pretty too! Since I did not have Sprite or 7 Up soda, I topped it up with chilled Mountain Dew. This was really really refreshing!! I served it to our family friends' who have flown in last week from India and they went crazy over this; they kept asking for me. I had so much fun making this over and over again! Thank you for a DELIGHTFUL REFRESHING UNIQUE drink!"
2663310,152143,2013-01-28,5,"This was delicious! I did not have any fresh parsley, but used dry parsley instead. I also did not have any parmesean on hand so I eliminated that ingredient. However, it was still very delicious!"
79538,122504,2005-10-09,5,This was very good. We just had it for dinner. I didn't have cream of chicken but had cream of chicken with herbs was very good with that. It makes a nice gravy sauce we had over mashed potatoes. I mix up the ingredients first. It mix up much better then in the frying pan. Thanks
347879,135814,2006-12-07,5,"I cant believe how good this was. We just ate it, and even my Hubby liked it. 
I left out the sour cream though, b/c my Hubby doesnt like it. but it still tasted great. He said that I could make it again. Great!"
71324,11763,2007-10-09,0,"I used oil instead of butter and got a very dense moist cake. The dough was more like a batter and as I'm not sure it was meant to be that way. That's why I'm only leaving a comment and no rating. I'll try this recipe again and will make it as stated, because I really like the flavour, so i'll update this review next time."
189616,30165,2007-07-13,5,"What can I possibly mention that hasn't been said before..Probably nothing! 
For ingredients I used 16 eggs, 1 lb. sweet sausage, diced green pepper, diced onions, diced ham, garlic, 1/3 c. 'real' bacon bits, fiesta blend cheese and 1/2 c. mild salsa. and used 9"" Burrito sized tortillas. I made this specifically for OAMC. Instead of spraying the sheet pan I used parchment paper. The bummer is I wished this made more than listed, due to the size of the tortilla I used (9"") I only was able to make 10, and these were close to 3/4 of a cup, not 1/2 c. of filling-again because my tortilla must have been too large.
Great recipe Tish, my family was sooo tired of plain old breakfast-we call it 'The most boring meal of the day'! This has made breakfast fun again. Instructions were perfect!"
216671,5297,2008-03-02,5,"Our family's love of sauce required a bit of math to get enough to drown the chicken!  Delicious and spicy!  DH really liked this one, thanks Dancer!"
37449,88868,2004-06-04,5,"I picked this recipe because our names are the same, and I'm glad I did! This was easy, looked very pretty,and tasted great! I used bacon bits instead of real bacon, and added a pinch more sugar to the mayo mixture. The only thing I left out was mushrooms, cause I didn't have any. I served this with Health nut brown rice. What a meal! Thanks so much for posting this! ;)"
2001195693,264190,2018-06-08,0,"Ok, here you go again! I wrote you yesterday about your ingredients not the same as your picture of the meal and now you did it again. What's the story here? You ask for &quot;1 medium onion, chopped&quot;, ok by me BUT your picture shows &quot;sliced GREEN onions&quot;. Make up your mind. Maybe that's why there are so many customers suggesting alternatives to your recipe because you are not straight with us."
135887,32204,2007-03-04,2,Sorry - I really wanted to like these but none of us (4) did.  I had a horrible time getting them out of the pan - they didn't stick but fell apart all over the place.  We practically had to eat them with a fork.  My kids asked me to go back to the box kind - they thought the flavor was off.
27813,8547,2002-10-16,5,"Great way to serve Brussel Sprouts, even to some of my family who don't like them"
2001946466,273428,2018-01-21,5,"It was amazing Thank you. It did indeed set quickly and just in time to serve too. I use this recipe with 'The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies' and omg the cookie wasn't that sweet and the icing took up for the sweetness. Everybody loved it, my classmates and my family. I even added 1/2 tsp - 1 tsp of unsweetened cocoa powder to half of the icing and wow just wow I'm currently in Culinary School and I will DEFINITELY be using this again. Thank You so much. God Bless:)"
900992,167848,2010-07-20,4,It was good. I'd leave the pine nuts out if I make it again.
2001817460,454943,2017-11-22,0,Mine turned out great though I had to make adjustments to the cocoa amount but great recipe
143318,243468,2008-06-28,5,"Not tart at all - this is deliciously sweet like the best limeade you've ever had! If you have the opportunity to try one of these...go for it! Citrusy and refreshing, and *much sweeter* than what we had everywhere in Brazil, from cheapos on the beach to fine dining restaurants. Rita's Recipe#59356 is more similar to what we had in Rio, but this version is much easier to drink. I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the key limes here and regular limes in the other version (but they are cuter). I never met a Caipirinha I didn't like - except the next day...for that reason I personally disagree with the ""quanto pior...melhor a"" adage..."
1630307,387415,2011-09-24,3,I thought this was just ok. I doubt I would make it again. My apples and pears seemed to lose all of their flavor and texture after cooking so long and roast seemed a bit dry even though it was soaking in liquid. Not bad and the kids actually ate it. Just not quite what I had in mind. Sauce was nice over brown rice.
169430,225196,2007-08-07,5,"I'm very impressed with this. It delivers a lot of satisfaction for very light fat load. I used fat free plain yogurt with about 3/4 tsp of low fat mayo for the dressing (I made 2 servings). The market didn't have any red onion so I used green onion in it's place and I was happy with that. I just now noticed that I forgot to put the celery in! The texture is great, kind of a crunchy soft. It's very fresh tasting and pretty to look at as well. Thanks for this one Parsley."
99325,34048,2006-05-22,5,"Wow! This is great. It's so good that I now use this instead of my mom's recipe when baking tarts, and pies  - and that's saying a lot. Excellent. Thanks!"
70073,394230,2009-12-23,5,"Delicious potatoes with such a nice presentation. I laid the handle of a wooden spoon (but you could use chopsticks) beside the potato to prevent cutting right through the potato. I sliced them at 1/4 inch intervals, used 1/4 cup butter and baked them at 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Another great addition to my potato (my favorite food) recipes. Very similar to recipes for hasselback potatoes."
51501,434894,2014-03-03,5,Followed the recipe to a &quot;T&quot;....these beans were delicious!!! The only thing I added was 2 lbs of chorizo sausage....make it taste similar to borracho beans. Thanks for sharing Whitty Smith!
227607,220648,2007-04-27,3,"This was very interesting for us.  We had never had anything ""curry"" before so did not know what to expect.  I never could find the curry basting sauce so I just mixed in some green curry paste with some butter to go on the top.  The only problem I had was that after baking it at 220 for 25 minutes the salmon was still totally raw.  I upped the temp to 375 and baked it for another 30 minutes to finish cooking it and it still was barely done.  The kids liked this ok, I thought it was ""ok""...I was hoping for more of the amarula taste to shine through, and my hubby took one bite and asked me to warm him up the meatloaf and mashed potatoes from last night.  I probably will not make again but thanks for exposing me to the curry flavor."
1345456,384577,2009-08-10,5,"Great recipe, we love blue cheese and this pork chop was absolutely delicious, wrapping it with prosciutto added just enough saltiness."
126440,4356,2009-01-25,5,"Made this with 1 lb, pork for Recipe #208429.  I let the meat meld for a couple of hours and cooked as called for in the recipe.  Had great flavor.  DH was eating it out of the bowl after cooking it."
145626,267554,2008-01-12,4,"We made these tonight to try to use up some schnapps we had.  It is soooooooooo strong!  We left it over crushed ice to try to cut some of the alcohol but after a few sips,we added cream to them.  Its still strong but not so sharp.  Delish, thanks for the idea."
424680,88729,2008-07-16,5,"This is AN ABSOLUTE FIRST RATE COLESLAW, & likely THE ONE that I'll be making from now on! Great taste & extremely exay prep ~ What more could a slaw lover want! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Tagged, made & reviewed in Please Review My Recipe]"
49937,77032,2003-12-11,5,"one word, YUM! I used chicken breasts because I hate picking meat off bones. I love lots and lots of herbs and spices on things and this was great. I can't wait to experiment with other meats!"
1109280,216778,2011-04-15,5,A big hit with all my fish eating Picky Eaters!  My PE questioned the idea of fish tacos but these were enjoyed by all.  For my DS I first fixed chicken strips the same way I did the fish and he loved the flavor.  I will be making this again! Thx
509259,74014,2007-10-21,5,"I doubled the recipe and used butternut squash instead of pumpkin,I also replaced the whipping cream with 1/2 & 1/2 cream as that is what I had on hand. The soup is delicious,quick & easy to make and freezes well."
227750,38085,2006-02-20,5,"EXCELLENT GREEK PSOMI (BREAD!)  My family really enjoyed it! Very soft and tasty. I shaped  round as we prefer it that way. YUM this will be made again, and again!  THANKS"
1838431,215999,2011-02-25,5,"This is my favorite meatball recipe.  The milk and oatmeal must make the difference.  I've made it with beef, turkey and a combo, all taste good.  And I agree--make lots and freeze for later.  Good for meatball sandwiches too."
813442,257429,2008-12-17,4,"I was thrilled to see this!!  I come froma large Scandinavian family, and this is very much a favorite. Our recipe is very similar to this. I would like to add that Klub is traditionally served with a little bacon grease poured on top...  also, much of the family (myself included) enjoy it with a side of cardamom cream sauce. mmm! mmm!"
157425,243369,2007-08-24,4,I dont care for bean salad with the creamy dressing and this one was great. Enjoyed the combination of beans and only used one small seeded jalapeno pepper. The dressing was very good and I think would be as good using Splenda brand sugars. Do toss lightly as the beans will break up easily. Refrigerated overnight and had for lunch the next day. Thank you Chef and good luck.
369715,293206,2008-10-09,5,This was very good and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly as written. We all enjoyed this. Made for Fall PAC 2008.
128473,178779,2006-09-28,5,"This was so good. I wasn't sure what to expect. It was so quick and easy with just a few ingredients. The texture of the bacon and the cabbage was nice. They were very tender and the flavour that they generated was wonderful. I added a little salt and pepper to serve. We really enjoyed this dish. I will be making this often, into the keeper box it goes. Thanks so much for sharing Linda Jean."
17803,34979,2005-08-08,5,"I used fresh Missouri Peaches to make these.  They have a very nice flavor so I would not cut back on the sugar as others thought they might do.  This made 2 and Â½ dozen for me.  I had a muffin with a cup of hot tea you see in the picture they went very well together.  Ocean~Ivy, I wish youâd come back and add more of your recipes.  You have so many alluring ones."
125349,27080,2004-03-15,5,"this was good. I made it with apples instead of blueberries and add some cinnamon. I also made it in two 6 oz. ramekins, and it worked out great. "
316717,105357,2007-04-19,4,this was my first time ever making bread. for some reason mine didn't rise. maybe because it's cold here? and there's no warm spot in the house? i don't know..but i baked it anyway. baked it in the oven since i had no bread machine. it tasted like pandesal but the texture was different. maybe that was due to my error of not getting it to rise? overall taste was very authentic. thanks for the great recipe! =)
68960,167421,2006-10-28,5,"Jan, Dave made this last night and it was amazing. Our crabs were already cooked so we just broke them apart and added them at the very end. Served over rice and will definitely make again. Yum!"
1702652,50144,2011-01-04,4,"I only gave this recipe 4 stars because I had to do some tweaking, but once I did it was VERY good!  I ended up mashing the potatoes to get more of a ""chowder"" consistency. I also added a can of corn and some cayenne pepper.  Without that, it was a bit bland. BF requested that I make this many times again. Thanks for the recipe!"
2001643730,360032,2017-07-26,5,"These are absolutely amazing! I substituted margarine for unsalted butter and mixed everything in one bowl, added a bit of water and left in fridge for 30 minutes. Also used self-raising flour. The outside is chewy and slightly crunchy, and the inside is soft and delicious! I definitely recommend this!! Absolutely loved these"
593513,350718,2009-08-25,4,This was a real delicious soup. Very creamy with a fantastic flavor. I made it last night for my lunch tomorrow. So quick to put together with a wonderful aroma. I made it as written except I couldn't find cremini and used button and bella mushrooms and I just roughly chopped them up. Thanks Uncle Bill for your recipe.
44642,49186,2003-04-17,5,"Oh this is so good!!!!!
You people out there try this.
Thank You, Bev"
394085,237426,2008-06-17,5,"Well, yeah, perfect. PERFECT. You simply can't beat this preparation for schnitzel, whatever meat you use. I did use panko for my breadcrumbs but otherwise followed the recipe precisely. Completely delicious--crunchy, savory, yum."
2002338680,231701,2018-11-19,1,"This was the worst Peanut butter fudge recipe I have ever tried, this was a waste of ingredients. It just turned to powder in the pan"
118268,22076,2007-07-24,5,I made these to go with cheese soup and they worked great!  I did not remove the crust (too lazy) and they came out fine.  Great in salad too!  Thanks for sharing!
53932,62795,2008-08-10,5,Simply delicious.  The tanginess of the vinegar contrasts so well with the sweetness of the tomatoes.
373821,45708,2006-11-30,1,"Northern Beans in a Texas Chili? And it won a Texas cook-off? It definately was not a sanctioned event. Any two or more people in Texas can make chili and call it a cook-off. Hope you didn't pay for the recipe or you got ripped. OH, and ""Where's the beef?"" You can't have Texas Chili without beef. That's like making corn chowder without corn."
416985,314918,2011-05-04,5,"My DD and DN loved these! And me too,especially because they are so easy and quick to get in the oven. I will be making these often. We all thought they tasted like a pastry you would buy in a bakery. Thanks! Made for BB Tag."
185387,79378,2005-12-28,5,"Oh my gosh, so glad I found this drink from the link on the front page. I love lemonade and slurpee's and this recipe is a great, easy recipe that will be made over and over again.. I love how slushy it is. Thanks for a great recipe.
:)"
2184361,78024,2012-02-15,5,"Well folks I've made this a few times now and must say this is good comfort food!  I tend to tinker just a bit with recipe's so for what it's worth here is what I have settled on as a final for this recipe.<br/>I use Jasmine Rice, Low Sodium Chicken Broth and Diced Tomatoes with Green Chillies and/or Lime Juice and Cilantro, dash of Cayenne Pepper, dash of White Pepper and 1 to 2 cups Frozen Corn added the same time as the Shrimp.  There is a great differance between Mexican Chorizo and Spanish Chorizo. I use either with great success. Serve with a dab of Sour Cream if desired.<br/>I always double the recipe item for item and the family and or guest's gobble this right up. On the rare occasion there are left over's you can warm this up and spoon into a flour tortilla with a dab of salsa and cour cream. Roll up the tortilla sprinkle with shredded cheese, melt the cheese and serve."
491095,63689,2007-07-02,5,"This was really good! I doubled the recipe for a larger crowd. Not that anything needs to be changed, but for my own preference (and the fact I'm trying to cut back on sugar) I may only use 1/2 the brown sugar next time. But this is a KEEPER for sure. Thanks for the great recipe!"
527607,425369,2010-06-28,5,"These were lovely, the bacon and nutmeg made a tasty difference"
306193,139627,2011-05-07,5,I put the filling in the mini phyllo cups.  Fantastic!
765437,15411,2008-09-03,4,"These were really tasty cookies for only having 3 ingredients and taking only 10 minutes to bake. I wouldn't call them the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had, but when you want a freshly baked cookie fast, they hit the spot."
523312,9793,2007-08-14,5,"Hi DiB's,
I have been making this for 20 years and everyone loves it after they get over the shock of Tomates
being sweet jam.With my kids grown up I make it into freezer jam now.
Thanks for posting it."
285039,495492,2013-03-02,5,I loved this combination of flavors; I also sprinkled some finely chopped prosciutto on top before baking.  I used homemade crust and sauce ... delicious!
743373,214634,2008-02-01,5,I love this recipe! I saw this on Everyday Italian and just HAD to try it. Yum!
2002218394,486255,2018-07-14,5,"I used the recipe for the two cups of mulberries I picked yesterday. I first boiled one-half cup of water in a heavy saucepan and then added a three-ounce package of regular strawberry jello and stirred until the jello dissolved and then added one tablespoon of lemon juice and stirred again. Next I added the two cups of fresh mulberries and let them cook at a medium boil in the covered pan for ten minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking and burning. Then I reduced the heat to medium and let the mixture simmer for five minutes before removing the pan from the heat to cool to room temperature. I divided the cooled berry mixture into six party cups (Dollar General brand, at 12 cups for $1), and this amounted to two to three tablespoons of jam mixture per cup. I placed on the lids and put the cups of jam into the freezer. My husband and I found the flavor sweet enough with just the sugar in the jello. Each small cup of jam should be enough for four to eight slices of already buttered toast."
157672,42460,2004-08-21,5,"I needed a dessert in a hurry, this was perfect and everybody loved it."
251917,323458,2008-09-18,5,FALL PAC 08: Zurie - this are OUTSTANDING! I was so excited to make them because I had an entire container of ricotta in my fridge calling my name!! Outstanding!!
59064,116349,2005-02-27,4,"Really easy to make especially with a food processor. For a convection oven, bake for 8-9 minutes initially and then for 25 minutes.
Very nice and very sweet recipe."
105471,182939,2007-04-22,4,"This was really convenient. I did mix the dry ingredients in advance, and I made them this morning when we were running late for church with no problem. I used miniature chocolate chips, because I had them, and my daughter loved them. Thanks!"
678366,226632,2010-07-05,5,I don't know why I didn't review this until now.I've been making this recipe for three years and passed it on to my sister and my mom.Garlic is a must! I liked it over thick noodles.
227652,37270,2007-04-18,5,"Yummy! This made a quick & easy lunch that tasted great. I used low sodium taco seas mix & a fat free butter spread. I used about 4 oz of chicken & cut the crumb mix into a quarter of the original, and still had about 1/2 of it leftover! So it'll be nice when I want to have them again! I dipped them into a mixture of fat free sour cream & salsa-so yummy!"
1802477845,332527,2015-01-03,0,I actually have a question how much peanut butter did you use? The recipe does not say?? Thank you..
57397,36354,2003-03-22,5,This was fantastic!!!  dad loved this hearty bread...and he is the guru of healthy heavy breads.  I did substitute the same amount of oatmeal for bran...just because dad wanted that instead.  Other than that I followed it to the T.  And it is good!  A healthy and tasty choice!
48956,9231,2003-04-05,5,"I love this recipe.  I've now made it a handful of times and found that using frozen chinese mixed veggies makes it even easier, quicker and cheaper to make.  "
509621,16521,2009-09-12,4,This was very easy and quick to prepare but very tasty. We omitted the mushrooms and added garlic pepper and ground chilli to the top of the pork chops before pouring the tomatoes on. Just a teeny bit dry but otherwise they were great. Will definitely make again.
296098,137575,2010-06-13,5,This is the only recipe I will ever need for salmon patties.  They were DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!
1191412,84324,2010-05-11,5,"Lovely blend of spices, thanks!!!"
508148,48582,2009-08-19,5,"These are very delicious, I've been making them for years now as I found the recipe in a Taste of Home Cooking School magazine from 1996."
853477,351699,2009-09-04,5,It was so easy to make and it was delicious! definitly needs salt though. I wonder what could stand in for the pie crusts to make this more healthy?
373020,102655,2011-10-21,5,These have to be cooked in butter!  My kids LOVE these.  They are great in lunch boxes and freeze well too.  A great recipe that requires only a few ingredients and creates a fabulous snack.
329638,217854,2007-05-05,4,"This was very tasty.  The lime juice was a little strong for my personal tastes, but it sure was fun to make out own soda- and the cerry was great with the ice cream!  Thanks for posting!"
33186,230880,2011-08-15,0,Congrats! Your recipe was featured as Recipe of the Day on our homepage today (8/15/11)!
539686,291842,2008-03-24,5,"This is a very tasty and easy to make weeknight dinner. I did jazz it up a bit, I sauted the chicken and bell peppers with some salt and pepper and some garlic. I also shook a little garlic powder and chili powder on the rice before topping with the chicken and sauce. Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders Game."
182010,114616,2005-10-18,5,"Lovely salad--I used toasted walnuts and non-fat yogurt.  Substantial flavors, yet very light in terms of fat and calories--will make this more.  Thanks, Inge!"
624830,217493,2008-01-21,5,"Mmmmm! We love this recipe. It's so moist and easy to mix up. I have a group of 25 to feed for breakfast and these are on the menu. Thanks, ccferne!"

Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for posting it!"
43083,107869,2010-03-26,5,"Moist, tasty and very ""cinnamony"" as my 8 yr old described. He said it was a bread sensation:) LOL. My BF enjoyed as well. Im on a low carb diet so I only had a small piece. However, that small piece was amazing. Thanks for sharing:) VERY easy and quick!"
251917,69173,2006-10-23,5,Delicious! I prefered them fried though but that is just my taste preference for meatballs! Thank you for an awesome recipe!
5060,273842,2008-01-02,5,"Ohh Yum!! These butter beans are soooo delicious! I had no bacon drippings so subed with butter and used red pepper flakes instead of regular black pepper, about a half teaspoon; also added a clove of garlic. We ate them as a meal with pull apart buns straight from the oven, a real ""comfort food"" meal!!
I will be making them again, thanks so much for posting in the comfort food photo event!!"
70073,210472,2007-02-17,5,Delicious and tender. A perfectly seasoned pork roast. I used the Kraft Sweet Recipes Brown Sugar Barbecue Sauce. It is a really tasty sauce. Served it with recipe #113532. The cabbage and noodles went really well with the pork roast.
2000009028,197712,2015-02-19,1,It would help to have measurements of the spices...
2182927,408199,2012-02-28,5,"This recipe is outstanding!  Makes me look like a 5 star chef!  I did tweak a few things which I highly recommend trying...makes for just about the healthiest francaise you're going to get.<br/><br/>First, I used tilapia instead of chicken.  Tilapia francaise!<br/><br/>Second, I baked the tilapia, not fried it.  Infinitely healthier!<br/>I used whole wheat flour with the proportion in the recipe.  I also added 1/4 cup panko crumbs (i'm not sure how much they actually stuck though because the flour got to it first...would probably skip this next time).  I added a little extra seasonings to the flour mixture to make up for the extra crumbs.  I coated 5 fillets, probably would have coated about 7.  I put aside the flour for the roux before coating.  <br/><br/>For baking the fish, I put the broiler on high, two rack spaces from the top and cooked 4-5 mins on each side.  I also cooked them on a (lightly sprayed with olive oil to prevent sticking) rack, not on a flat pan.  They came out perfect.<br/><br/>I followed all other specification to the recipe, except I crushed two cloves of garlic and added them at step 5 with the shallots and artichokes.  I highly recommend adding this!  Be sure not to burn the garlic!  I did use the amount of lemon juice it called for--we like lemony francaise.  When making for guests I would probably use a little less as it is quite lemony.<br/><br/>As for the sauce in general, it was enough for 4 out of 5 of my fillets.  I would probably double the sauce recipe next time I make it.<br/><br/>If you do make it with fish, be very careful when adding the fish to the sauce because they can be very delicate.  I broke a couple pieces off in this process.  Still tasted just as good :)  Make sure you make your sauce in your absolutely biggest pan!  <br/><br/>I served our tilapia francaise with brown rice and garlic and olive oil sauteed spinach.  Enjoy!"
740255,297536,2008-04-29,5,"This was absolutely delicious!!!  My husband and I enjoyed this so much!  And it made a ton, enough to feed us both for dinner for 3 days!  We like garlic a lot, so we used 5 cloves of garlic, roma/plum tomatoes and eggplant from the farmers market, and whole wheat thin spaghetti.  It was so easy to make, and so good!  I did add some dried basil since I ran out of fresh.  I had a little less than 1/4 c. of fresh, and about 1 tsp of dried.  It was very fresh and comforting.  I swear, fresh mozzarella really makes a difference in flavor compared to pre-shredded.  Thank you for posting this awesome recipe!"
355637,36023,2008-08-18,4,"This was really good! Made everything as is, and I doubled the gravy."
39835,132472,2006-01-22,5,"These are the best scones I've ever had! Dh said ""these are better than Starbucks!"" This easy-to-make recipe makes a lot of dough which I found easier to handle in sections, but they are scrumptous! We will be having these often! Thanks for sharing~"
718620,323500,2009-08-25,4,"this was yummy - i made it with chicken breasts, since that's all I ever have...i made a little extra sauce, and I'm glad I did, because it would not have been enough to cover the chicken if I hadn't...the picky boyfriend loved it  :-)"
27060,17985,2002-11-30,0,"Your recipe said ""do not drain"" the raisens.  So I followed the instructions and it turned out soupy.  I added oatmeal to soak up the moisture, but it was still too runny.  I must have done something wrong.  Should I have drained the raisens? (my instinct said yes, yet they were called ""soft"" so I didn't.)  Where did I go wrong?  "
310953,59363,2007-05-05,5,"I gave this a whirl today to impress my lady friend for lunch.. When I watched it come to life under the broiler, I said ""this is going to be good""...And so it was.. Just the right amount of seasonings- not overpowering-"
95139,150863,2008-10-22,5,"I made this on a chilly day. I had everything on hand and followed the recipe as is. It was great. My husband liked it as well. The consistancy was good, not thin at all.  Thanks for posting."

315084,164411,2006-07-30,5,"I am so glad I found this recipe it is so very good.  I was desperate to use up some chicken and not about to heat up the kitchen in this heat.  I didn't have crm of mushroom soup so used crm of chicken soup, didn't have canned mushrooms so used fresh, didn't have onion soup mix so used onion mushroom soup mix and added in some garlic cause we love garlic but other than that I followed the recipe to a T.LOL It turned out so tender. This one is definately a keeper.  Thanks for posting it."
865936,101820,2009-03-26,4,"Really great olives!  Way better than straight from the jar, and so easy to do."
22015,95866,2005-09-13,5,These were excellent.   I made these for a luncheon with my girl friends and they were a huge hit.   The pepper jelly mixed beautifully with the cheese and shrimp.
57916,34784,2002-11-20,5,"We love this recipe. Makes great
buns too."
516760,190887,2007-08-01,5,"I love Elizabeth David's cookbooks, so I knew this recipe would have to be good, and I wasn't disappointed. The cake has an intense chocolate flavour but it's not sickly sweet. I froze half the cake in slices so I wouldn't eat it all on the day I baked it. It's very good to eat straight from the freezer too - the texture becomes more dense upon freezing, but it's still fantastic.  I'll be making this again!"
1085257,128956,2008-12-19,0,"This is great soup!  I added the ground BocoBurger, and it tasked great.  My husband liked it too."
157425,151173,2006-02-12,5,"A great green bean casserole, simple and quick! I forgot to buy the mushrooms but this was still quite good. I used two cans of cut green beans instead of fresh green beans. Thank you Laurie, this will be a family favorite! "
128473,325278,2010-02-19,5,"What a lovely robust soup this was.  We really enjoyed this tasty treat.  Made exactly as written except that I couldn't find cannellini beans anywhere, so I subed with romano beans.  The soup was hearty, thick and oh so satisfying.  Thank you so much for sharing this winner.  We have had a lot of snow this month and your soup was thoroughly enjoyed. :)"
148620,50750,2004-10-16,5,"did not use parsley, used cheddar instead of jack cheese. Very very very very good!"
2200275,15740,2012-03-03,0,i liked the recipe:) so did the family...<br/><br/>i did change<br/>sugar= brown sugar<br/>corn flakes=bran flakes<br/>garlic powder=garclic salt parsley flakes<br/><br/>overall went very well. i used 3 eggs to coat and also about doubled the shake but concept stayed the same.<br/><br/>made with<br/>garlic/onion mashed potatoes with a chicken gravy made from drippings..  <br/><br/>defiantly will save for future use.
329304,313521,2009-06-15,5,"I absolutely loved this when it first came out of the oven. Unfortunately, hubby and daughter did not care for it so there were leftovers.  It wasn't quite as good the next day but it wsa still tasty and deserves 5 starts.  I can't wait to try it with a hot bowl of chili!"
39404,14865,2004-05-04,5,"Couldn't stop eating! Great flavor, very easy to prepare!"
1455936,223975,2010-01-02,5,"Excellent cookie!  I made these over the Christmas holiday because one of my friends was allergic to eggs.  What a shame should she not have any holiday cookies to enjoy! These were a hit - even us those not allergic to eggs enjoyed them very much!

The only change I made is that I didn't have any mini chocolate chips.  So I just used the regular size, and put in one 12-oz bag.

Thank you, luvthezaar, for posting this recipe!  I've recently baked these since the holidays because I didn't have any eggs.  Very tasty cookie!"
50778,18121,2003-03-03,5,"Awesome!  My new favorite chocolate cake.  I made mine in a bundt pan as well and didn't add the nuts.  I had no problems with the batter or the frosting- both stirred up smooth and beautiful (just had to really stir 'em).  For those that said the frosting was too granular- you perhaps used the wrong type of sugar?  Icing sugar= powdered sugar. Anywho- all in all a brilliant cake. Light and airy and not too sweet.  Thanks Miller for my new favorite cake recipe.  Oh, and I didn't have any Guinness, so substituted MacTarnahan's Blackwatch Cream Porter- please don't stone me.  ;) "
143387,129345,2009-05-04,5,Delicious and so easy to prepare.  Definately taste like a meal at a 5 star restaurant.
1802794105,277708,2014-06-03,5,"I found this to be a very good recipe though I did substitute 1 C. applesauce (instead of the shortening) because I didn&#039;t have any shortening, and I used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil (instead of butter), because I read somewhere that oil will give you a moister cake (which I believe is true!). I aso added 2 tsp. banana extract flavor (just in case the overripe,black bananas were not banany tasting enough)- I put 1 C walnuts in it also and it turned out nice and moist.I did ice it also with a simple powdered sugar,butter,vanilla,milk icing.really good with a glass of milk or a cup of coffee.Honestly I cant stand when people doa review and change everything but I was of the mindset of trying to tweak it just right - and I think I did! just that&lt;br/&gt;!"
86318,50161,2006-04-30,0,"I'd like to leave a review of this with no stars because, although the resulting bars are pretty good, I did have some problems with them that may have been caused by my scaling the recipe to fit a different size pan. The first problem was that it took much much longer than the stated time for the cookie part to bake. And, perhaps because of overkill, the resulting cookie turned out quite dry. Next, the chocolate frosting - I set the pan in cold tap water to cool it, but after about 5 minutes, realized that it was thickening too quickly. I mixed the chocolate mixture with with the confectioners's sugar, but the mixture was much too dry. This was cured with about 2 tablespoons milk. Overall, while a bit firmer and drier than ideal, I did get cookies that are nice enough to take in to work. I'm sure my fellow workers will thank you for their treat.  "
353205,350563,2010-01-30,5,"From one St. Louis Girl to another--We love your Gumbo!  It is AWESOME!!  I made it the first time last week, and I am already making it again for my mother's birthday.  Very delicious, and wekk worth any extra effort."
424680,417125,2010-03-31,5,"I got a little carried away when making this recipe, in that I used 2 russet potatoes & 2 sweet potatoes (our yams, at least here in the USA's SouthWest!) & kept the filling for the 2 varieties separate! ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL BOTH WAYS ~ I kinda prefer the yams, while my other half enjoys the white potatoes, so this kind of twist to the recipe satisfied us both, with a bit of each! Really enjoyed the 'chili' element here, & topped it all off with a sharp cheddar ~ My other half included the sour cream, but I didn't! Thanks for another great recipe! [Made & reviewed in Everyday's a Holiday]"
1444953,471221,2012-10-02,5,This is EXCELLENT!  Doubled the recipe and somehow got 6 pints (1/2 pints).  Tastes great on bagels with cream cheese and will try as a topper for Falafel Burgers soon!  Definitely adding to my canning recipes for sure and several jars will go as gifts - thank you!
447742,307936,2010-12-12,5,"This is defintely a Five-Star recipe!  So easy to make using a stand mixer, and the texture is wonderful!  I make this often - Thank you for sharing."
2000720339,19653,2015-11-29,2,This recipe needed more liquids when I did it. We had to add an extra egg milk and vegetable oil. After we did that it worked.
197023,150914,2009-04-18,5,"Loved these gnocchi, though they did take me longer to prepare than 15 minutes and I had halved the recipe! I'm generally slower in my preparation than most Zaar recipes indicate! Since I love spinach, ricotta and sage, I knew I'd love these as soon as I tagged the recipe for Newest Zaar Tag. Since I don't make gnocchi often - it's something I've very much got to be in the mood for making - I was glad of the wonderfully clear instructions, especially the advice in step 4. I refrigerated the dough for the several hours suggested - 7 hours actually - and these proved to be the lightest and most delicious gnocchi I've ever made, so that this is very much a recipe I'll be making again - but never on a week night! LOVED the sage sauce! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, MsPia!"
231054,107997,2006-07-13,0,"I'm not going to select any stars because I don't want to lower your overall rating -- but this was just not the dish for us.  I love hot stuff -- but it was a little too hot for me.  I think I'll just stick to Shrimp Scampi.  I KNOW this has to be a great recipe -- as evidenced by all the stars it has received.  So on behalf of all of those folks, thanks for posting a recipe that has been so very popular.  I'll search around for some of your other recipes to try.  Happy cooking.  Bobbie"
1371008,21761,2011-04-21,5,"This is now my favorite way to do sprouts!  We have now added this recipe to our family holiday tradition menu and anytime they are in the house this is how we eat them.  I actually need to buy more sprouts because my kids are now eating mom and dad's serving.  Thanks for sharing, so delicious!"
1052873,448675,2014-08-27,5,I used spaghetti squash. We have an abundance of spaghetti squash and tomatoes. Very tasty. Made for CQ14.
1584433,173129,2010-11-02,5,"I think these are the best turkey burgers I've ever had!  I omitted red pepper (personal preference), but made as otherwise listed.  Thank you for posting. : )"
63691,48777,2002-12-19,5,"Another great recipe from spacace! I gave it a test run before my holiday guests arrived and it was very tasty.  Rest assured, I will be serving this several times over the next week!"
756086,78002,2011-09-26,5,My family LOVES this salad!  My DH made it on Saturday to give me a break from cooking.  I was so impressed that he took the initiative to make something so fabulous ;)
56112,441361,2010-11-09,5,We really did enjoy this recipe very much.  Made pretty much as directed....with the addition of groung turkey.....DH will not eat chili that does not have meat in it.  Will be making this again for sure.
107583,503813,2013-08-16,5,"Very simple, basic bread, great for soup.  I cut recipe in half and still had a lot of bread.  Will be making this again.  Made for ZWT 9."
239758,329547,2010-11-11,5,"The addition of vegetables makes this different from any beef rendang I have ever tasted, but that doesn't keep it from being totally delicious. I didn't have a jalapeno, so used a long green chilli which gave a lovely, mild result. This is a perfect go-to recipe for a busy night. Once you've cubed the meat and chopped the veggies, the rest takes no time at all. I reckon you could get the preparation out of the way in the morning or even the night before. Thanks so much for posting."
502808,145573,2009-06-08,5,Oh my was this good!!! You do have to have a gallon of milk sitting by though. Loved it.
166711,86394,2006-08-28,4,"Found this recipe when looking for something like a Frito Pie with no baking.  I hadn't eaten much all day and wanted something fast to not only use with Fritos, but for snacking on homemade tortilla chips too - something more satisfying than plain ol' salsa.  I initially didn't use the tomato soup, stewed tomatoes or chili powder because we had a LOT of homemade salsa on hand so I used that instead.  Problem is the salsa was too hot for me so I couldn't taste anything!  Argh!  So I've added the tomato soup.  I plan on adding mozzarella cheese next time to cut some of the heat.  My boyfriend loved it!"
2001144808,93886,2016-08-28,5,"I have never made apple butter before and this recipe was very simple and easy. After reading some reviews, I decided to use less sugar. I used 2 1/2 cups regular sugar and a half cup brown sugar for a total of three cups. I also put in two teaspoons of lemon juice. I had to puree it at the end to make it smooth, but it came out fantastic! Very smooth and thick. My son, who is picky eater, said it tastes just like apple pie."
273543,82102,2010-03-10,5,"Used swiss cause i didn't have any parm on hand, but it was still delicous! Looking forward to trying it again with parmesan!"
502910,108105,2007-06-21,5,"My 5 year old niece helped me make this.  She is such a picky eater, but she couldn't get enough!  It was fantastic!  And so simple to make!"
117440,247150,2009-05-07,5,I love this recipe.  I buy a package of chorizo and use half for eggs and then make a half batch of these taquitos later.  Very tasty and simple.  Thanks for sharing.
199020,149734,2007-05-28,5,These were delish! And so easy!  I used dark chocolate fudge cake mix instead of german chocolate just because I like it better.  I bet the coconut/sweetened condensed milk/nut/chocolate chip topping would be great on brownies!  Thanks for the recipe.  I am sure I will make this again.
174096,381522,2011-07-22,5,"Loved these!!  I used a blend of crookneck and straight yellow squash, gluten free flour blend, and butter.  Very easy to make and had a fabulous flavor.  I will definitely be keeping this handy during the rest of squash season!  Thanks for sharing!"
928411,191486,2009-09-08,5,"This is a great receipe, if your low carbing or just love Cauliflower. My husband raved about it all night. He has been missing his Risotto since we started our Low Carb life style. I steamed the Cauliflower first, thinking I could use my potatoe ricer to break it into smaller pieces. That didn't work as well as I thought it would, but it work like a strainer to get all the water out. Then I put it into a small chopper, not wanting to get the big food processor out. Did it in a couple of batches. I also use heavy cream because that's what I had on hand. I did use extra Chicken Broth because I think I got to much water out. But it was wonderful.  It's in my cookbook and I will make this again and again. I made half the receipe and used it as a side dish with or Salmon. Thanks for sharing."
900992,283505,2012-10-15,5,Delicious! Thanks for posting!
1800243352,209249,2015-01-10,5,Loved it! Even my picky 8yr old thought this quiche was great :) Thanks for the wonderful recipe.
199792,195767,2008-04-29,4,"These have a great flavour for biscuits made from a mix. I did make them on a cookie sheet and they spread quite flat, actually very flat. Perhaps the sour cream could be reduced a little. They quickly browned on the bottom but the top didn't ever really get to be a golden brown. They still tasted good and we enjoyed them fresh out of the oven. I will try these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe."
103876,96154,2009-10-15,5,Very good!  I think the difference in this recipe is the chopping the chicken in the food processor.  Makes the consistency perfect for sandwiches.  My family loved it!  Thanks for posting.
1102578,60466,2009-02-01,4,"Made this as written except for the cheese -- we just sprinkled cheese on top for those who wanted it.  This makes a lot! Good if you're stretching your food dollar like we are! Thanks for the recipe! We enjoyed it, especially my 7 year old niece!"
212609,35480,2009-01-07,5,"I have absolutely no frame of reference for this dip,as I have never had the pleasure of tasting the original,but I'm glad that I've had the chance to try this!
The ingredient list is intriguing to say the least,but the flavour that those ingredients produce when blended together was amazing.
We used it to dip wedges and chicken fingers into,it worked really well.
I took the tip from another review and saved some to use in quesadillas-delicious-I'll certainly be doing that again!
Made for Comfort Cafe Jan '09."
169430,224109,2010-06-08,5,"Being both a coffee lover and a constant sugar free pudding fan this was a natural for me. I didn't have vanilla pudding but white chocolate worked perfectly well. I'm just not too sure why it's supposed to take an hour and fifteen mins, mine was set and ready within 10 mins. All in all, very yummy."
223854,248838,2008-01-14,5,"Yum! I made this recipe to dress Recipe #216163 and it was so easy to put together, the flavour and texture was really good.  Thank you Nonnie4Two"
467659,80470,2009-03-30,3,"I made these before a long road trip as a sweet treat we could all enjoy with little mess. They were okay. They took a long time to bake in the oven and never looked really done. I guess that is the look of this recipe. I felt the vanilla was a bit too much. Tasted fine, but these weren't our favorites."
105601,12709,2005-01-29,5,Outstanding--definitely company-worthy chicken.  This will be a classic dish at our home.
1602538,427857,2010-06-09,0,"why would anyone eat this everyday?   600 calories, 45+ grams of fat,crazy sodium and cholesterol.  I'm not sure why low carb is a plus on this one."
537937,261365,2007-11-23,4,"I made these as listed and didn't add/delete a thing.  Two of the three guys said they were a little bland.  I was going to put them in spaghetti sauce over noodles, but they were eating them as fast as I took them out of the oven.  Next time, I'll make as spaghetti or even add a sweet/sour sauce over all and put in the crockpot.  Thanks for the quick and easy recipe~"
798300,44263,2010-06-04,5,Delicious! I used butternut and acorn squash from the farmer's market and it baked up beautifully! Thanks!
174096,162557,2007-05-20,5,"Thanks for a quick, delicious recipe!  I also used milk for the glaze, and halved the amount of glaze that I made.  I only used 1 T of sugar in the rolls (we don't like things too sweet).  It came out perfectly!  And the tip about using the floss to cut was wonderful!"
203467,150384,2006-02-25,5,"I too, was wishing I would have doubled the recipe. The soup was simply delicious. I omitted the carrots and didn't puree."
542159,400760,2010-03-01,4,"Enjoyed this pretty side. The nice green asparagus along with the little ribbons of orange dress your every day rice. Made as written, next time may try using  2 cups of stock and no water. Thanks so much for the post."
428885,259163,2007-11-09,5,"Oh this is wonderful! I did this early, and am making it again for Thanksgiving. The taste is so yummy with the orange, cinnamon, apples, and banana. It was really easy to put together, and the caramelized fruit and cream added to the potatoes is outstanding. I used gingersnaps ground up in the food processor instead of the ginger bread but other then that stayed true to the recipe. A nice change for the humble little sweet potato and plan on serving this quite often. Oh yes, one other little addition I added some little crushed walnut pieces to the top of the the casserole while it was cooking along with the gingersnaps, because I had a bunch sitting that needed to be used. A nice crunch! Thanks, MarraMamba a true delightful treat."
222139,170592,2009-01-09,5,Loved it!  I am surprised this recipe has not been tried before. I loved the fact that you can control how much sweetness you want to add. For the sweet n sour sauce I chose to use recipe Recipe #76003.  This one will be a family favorite of ours.
750780,331928,2011-05-21,5,"I just took them out of the oven...had to eat one straight on! I was very pleased. I used the honey and I added a 1/2 tsp of ground ginger (no special reason, it was just sitting by the cinnamon when I reached for it) I used a bit more vegetables...I used both squash and carrots. Instead of raisins I used chopped dates (again, no special reason. I just had dates but not raisins) They will be a nice accompaniment to my lunch next week :)"
447921,131323,2007-05-08,5,"This was really yummy, really garlicky, creamy and very authentic. I served it with homemade whole-wheat pita bread and of course chilled white wine! We ate so much of it that what was supposed to be a starter ended up being our whole meal."
911245,43072,2008-08-03,5,"Delicious and adaptable recipe. I made it twice. The first time, I made with 1/2 cup of eggbeaters(equal to two eggs) and added 1 scoop of vanilla protein powder and a teaspoon of olive oil. They came out perfect. Acted like a regular pancakes on the griddle and looked fantastic and tasted perfect. The second time I added blueberries and they came out soggy. I think in the future I'll make them like I did the first time and save extras for the topping. Thanks for posting the recipe!"
1803187172,280699,2014-10-01,5,"This is a really great soup, Maybe back in 2008 when Newly Mrs. Johnson submitted it from her fellow WW member the point value was only 2.5 points per cup, but todays point value is 7 points per cup."
590105,392609,2010-01-02,5,"My 5yo son said, ""this is fantastic,"" and later, ""Mom, could you make this again?"" I made it with one big frozen banana instead of the ice cream, (for a total of 3 bananas) but otherwise followed directions. (Frozen bananas pretty much pass for ice cream around here.) I used Oregon Chai's decaf version. This is *really* good and tastes a little like eggnog. Thanks! Reviewed for the Veg*n Swap."
1167475,32204,2009-07-21,0,"Great Brownie Recipe!  What floated my boat is mint, so I added, about 1/2  cup of york  peppermint patties ( small ones cut into 4 sections ) and a half cup of marshmallows.  I didnt stir them all the way in, I kind of stuck them into the top.  Everyone loved them! I imagine any candy bar chopped up would work.  ( peanut butter cups YUM )  Thank You!"
1051707,275878,2011-02-10,5,"Yum!  What a wonderful, buttery caramel corn.  I was looking for a caramel corn recipe that didn't call for brown sugar or corn syrup because I didn't have either on hand.  This recipe was quick and easy, and it is going into my cookbook permanently.  I changed my version up a bit - used peanuts instead of almonds, 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp. of almond extract."
377581,25551,2009-05-11,4,"I used chop suey vegetables. Since a few mentioned it tasted bland I added garlic, ginger, and soy sauce. This recipe is so versatile. This is an enjoyable, inexpensive meal and very quick and easy to prepare. Thank you for posting!"
290578,63401,2007-08-20,5,"These muffins were SO good -great texture, very moist, and taste HEAVENLY. I halved the recipe, but used about a quarter more cranberries than called for because I was trying to get rid of some. Because the recipe didn't say how long to bake it and at what temperature, I did about 20 minutes at 265F, which worked well. I also added about a 1/4 cup more sugar (1/2 if you do the whole recipe) because the batter tasted a tad bland, but after having eaten them baked I think they would taste great without that addition too. These would probably taste nice even without the cranberries just as a bran muffin. I am definitely going to make them again, thanks!"
1010338,375567,2009-07-28,4,"Made for Summer '09 Comfort Cafe.  This was so smooth and easy to spread.  Light and fluffy, too.  A little different taste for me (not sure if it was the cream cheese or heavy cream), but whatever it was it did not deter from this really tasty frosting.  Thanks for sharing this with all of us."
717221,104346,2013-09-30,5,"Notes for future cooks of this recipe: This only made 12 smallish triangles for me and  I doubled the amount of corn called for. Perhaps my onion soup mix wasn&#039;t well spiced, so I added some &quot;potato spice&quot; and &quot;lemon pepper&quot; before baking. Having said that, these are amazing! I cannot stop eating them!! I used red peppers and green jalapenos for a lovely colour combo and a mix of cheddar and extra-mature cheddar for the topping. The wedges reheat beautifully and are so tasty warm or cold. I had some the next day topped with ham for lunch - yummy! I&#039;m sure this is a very adaptable recipe and will try adding some different ingredients each time (chopped ham, olives, mushrooms - endless variations come to mind). Thank you, chef luvmybge, for a super recipe - a keeper for me, for sure :)"
12882,102775,2006-03-11,1,"It was a bit bland.  I doctored it up a bit by adding more sugar and using frozen coffee cubes instead of frozen ice cubes.  This improved it quite a bit.  But as written, I felt it just didn't have enough to it."
1446578,135477,2009-11-13,5,Delish... Not expecting that great flavor from such a little amount of ingredients. Would recommend doubling the recipe for about a half pound of pasta and shrimp. Not as much as the recipe photo on the page though. That looks like it was tripled. Add a bit of grated cheese and a dash of fresh lemon juice after plating it. Wow.
506810,4049,2007-11-06,5,"This was the best sweet potato pie I have ever made and eaten.It was so easy to make.
LOVED IT!!!!!"
394085,40272,2010-03-03,5,The BEST savory sweet potatoes I ever have had.  Simply wonderful.
1900301,62221,2015-01-27,4,"I used Granny Smith apples, doubled the topping and cooked in a single dish.  We ate it warm with a dollop of vanilla flavored Greek yogurt.  Everyone gobbled it up.  This is a keeper.  Ty, Kim127."
242503,175411,2006-12-26,2,"I tried this twice. I am giving two stars because it is not like it did not turn out or that it was ineatable but it was just not for me. From the time I opened the molasses, that is all i could smell and then when I tried the pie it is all i could taste. I wanted to try this, to see how it was. My husband liked the pie. It set up good and looked wonderful, but i think i just could not get past the molasses thing."
79219,20884,2008-08-04,3,"These were good, and they do stay soft, but I'll keep looking for that perfect chewy choc chip cookie. To be fair, I had 'Zaar halve the recipe, which resulted in 2 eggs Ã¢â¬â maybe that's too much. But the ""dough"" was extremely soft; no way could anyone ""roll into balls"" for baking. Refrigerating a bit didn't really help much, though maybe a longer chill would have. As it was, they really spread out and bumped into each other on the sheet."
154574,83381,2008-10-05,5,"This curry is fantastic. I made it for dinner last night for DH and I and we both loved it. However, I didn't have any bamboo shoots, so I added some julienned carrots and some sugar snap peas. I also didn't have red curry paste, so I had to use curry powder instead. I love the flavour the kaffir lime leaves give to this dish and the bit of heat from the chilli is good too. I only added one chilli as I don't like my mouth burning too much, but my husband said he would have added more if he made it just for himself. The only thing I will do next time is to halve the amount of fish sauce or use soy sauce instead as it was a little salty for our tastes. We will definitely be making this curry again. :)"
461834,298439,2014-05-05,4,"Nice oatmeal cookies!!  I made 1/2 of the recipe and used part whole wheat flour and AP flour and used 1/2 of the raisins as some of my family doesn&#039;t care for them and did end up adding more oats as I felt it needed more of them.  I think the nutmeg  was too strong in flavor for my tastes, so would probably leave it out next time, or just put a sprinkle in the batter.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for Spring PAC 2014."
37305,29801,2002-06-04,5,"These are delicious! Rich but light, if you can believe that :) I used milk chocolate because semisweet bothers my stomach, but they were still awesome...I am sure the semisweet would have been a bit more decadent! I also used miniature muffin tins. They took 4 minutes in the oven and it made 27 minis. Thanks! The kids LOVE them!
P.S. I am uploading a picture of what mine looked like until you post one of your own :)"
2525948,83828,2012-11-24,5,We had Cornish Game Hens for Thanksgiving and I needed something to make some Really Good leftovers.  Made the sauce per recipe then added large chunks of hen and warmed ~10 min.  Variation: used 1/2 pint of Light Cream and then added milk as it simmered to achieve the right consistency.  Thought of adding Parm but that would be over the top.  Served over simple long grain rice with green beans and carrots.
59064,128871,2007-10-02,5,Very quick and easy to make and popular with everyone. Big hit with the kids.
2000408826,28768,2015-08-17,0,Excellent but I used 1 lb of ground deer meat with the Italian sausage and mixed cottage and ricotta cheese.  So good.
494084,518066,2015-02-07,5,"Very good.  DH and I enjoyed this healthy, easy, and quick salad.  A little sweet, a little tangy.  Kids were less thrilled but I guess thats to be expected...sigh.  Thanks for the great recipe...."
2189403,70338,2012-09-11,5,"A very light and refreshing salad! I used ham instead of bacon as it was the only thing I have on hand and omit eggs as I was also in the midst of preparing another 3 dishes. Was so busy that I forgot the cheese but hey, it's still amazing! Made this for hubby's birthday lunch and it was a big hit! Will be making this again and next time I will remember eggs and cheese. Thank you!"
299849,120444,2008-04-30,5,This is sooooo good!  :)
37779,112624,2006-10-13,4,"I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added about 3 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds and 1 cup chopped scallions to the noodles instead of garnishing with them. Kids, husband and I enjoyed this one very much. Thanks."
151325,140834,2005-10-29,5,"The sweetness of the pumpkin was a wonderful contrast to the 'nutty' flavoured bulgar.  Loved the cinnamon, which gives an extra depth to this dish.  "
724516,426699,2010-06-09,5,"This was very very nice, I put a bit more garlic and 2 tablespoons of fresh Oregano this was the first year I have grown it successfully so I was pleased to use my own. I brushed it over salmon with a grind of sea salt and black pepper and baked it uncovered in the oven then poured a bit more on when it was on the plate, and served it with Mediterranean salad, it was delicious. Thank you so much for this very nice recipe. Made for ZWT#6 2010"
329671,60755,2010-08-22,5,"I have made these pancakes a few times and they turned out great!  I found them fluffy and light and delicious!  I have added a tbl of lemon juice and vanilla extract, to sour the milk and it gives it a buttermilk flavor, but it isn't necessary..."
1187404,15682,2014-01-22,5,Delicious!  Really easy to make too.  Comes out moist and flavorful.  For an extra kick try soaking the walnuts and raisins in rum or bourbon for a few hours or overnight before adding to the batter.  It&#039;s gooood!
298447,248676,2011-05-07,5,"Two thumbs up!   Made with whole wheat tortillas.  Unfortunately, there was no pepperoni on hand, but no one seemed to mind or know the difference.  I would love to try this with salami, so maybe next time I will!  Very versatile and easy to change up depending on what you have in the fridge.  Plus, there are some great suggestions listed from other reviewers.  Thanks, Megs..it was delish!"
1803366182,59519,2015-03-12,0,Definitely not worth the calories!!!!
308765,119680,2008-01-07,3,These were a good idea for a snack but for us were relatively dry.  The tuna to egg ratio is probably what did it.  I'm not sure what this needed but it also needed a little more spice. Thanks for posting.
844554,118766,2009-08-31,5,"Yummy, yummy! My neighbor brought over 8 very ripe papayas (they have a papaya farm) and it's just me and hubby, so I went looking for a papaya bread recipe. This was wonderful. I didn't shred the papayas because they were very ripe, didn't have allspice or raisins and used pecans. I only had to bake mine about 55 minutes so be wary! Thanks for a great, new recipe for the keeper file."
1749573,84202,2010-12-02,0,"I have been baking this cake since 1956, and this recipe seems to have been altered by someone who does not really like buttermilk.  If you stir the baking soda into the buttermilk you will just neutralize the buttermilk and will not add any leavening to the cake.  I sometimes add a teaspoon of plain white vinegar to a cup of buttermilk to make it stronger before using in a recipe.  I certainly would not want to neutralize it.  Use lemon juice instead of vinegar if it is a recipe that lemon flavor will enhance.  But with this cake I use just one quarter teaspoon of baking soda for leavening, and I add it last, right before putting the batter in the pan, so that it will still be working as leavening as the cake bakes."
593726,105365,2009-08-03,5,"I really liked this!  I used one can of diceds tomatoes and one of crushed tomatoes with basil, I also only used 4 onions.  Thanks for posting this!"
183964,26901,2005-06-23,5,These were very good! I didn't have any cracker crumbs but I was reading another one of your recipes that called for cracker crumbs OR breadcrumbs so I subbed bread crumbs. I served with a mayo/horseradish sauce. Really terrific!
36944,10480,2002-08-12,3,This was easy to make and the flavor was okay.  I think when serving fresh fruit that I would prefer the taste of fresh fruit in the cream cheese and then make as shown.
851258,73166,2011-10-11,0,add 1/2 bar of good choclate and omit the coco .Melt the choclate over a double boiler then add to the mixture .
2236965,338139,2012-04-11,0,"I love this recipe it was so helpful, I thought the way I made it turned out so awesome, Thank  you for the recipe! Soy, orange zest, etc. makes it your own, thanks for the ideas everyone!"
93446,63138,2007-02-20,5,"I made these for dinner for Pancake Tuesday.  They were delicious - light, fluffy and healthy to boot!  Now I just need to get a new non-stick pan as even with a light coating of cooking spray, they were sticking.  My husband is looking forward to having the leftovers for breakfast tomorrow!"
2000431901,504556,2016-08-29,5,"SO delicious! I've made it as written, but also subbed hoisin sauce when out of oyster sauce and, although it changes the flavor, it's still wonderful."
757556,107271,2008-04-12,5,So simple and easy to throw together.... Everyone loved it.  I tweaked it for 2 families and I used fire roasted tomatoes...  YUM!!!!  The only thing that I will make sure is that all of the rice is under the mix. I had some crunchy ones that layed on top.  Thanks for sharing.
452355,171515,2008-11-06,5,"This recipe was really good.  Easy to make, fantastic flavor.  I should have read the other reviewers' comments first, as mine did come out very oily.  You could easily reduce the olive oil to 1/2 cup as evelyn/athens suggested.  We followed all directions and ingredients as posted and topped with fresh parm.  Thanks, Kim!"
173579,92283,2013-04-21,5,This is a very good recipe.  I used it for Claudia&#039;s E-z Strawberry Pizza Pie 92226 recipe.  My family just raved about it.  It was so quick and easy to make.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
894666,19859,2016-03-05,5,"Honestly all I did was dump all the ingredients in the crockpot without any mixing or combining, doesn&#039;t get any easier than this, I wasn&#039;t around for the results but the kids gobbled it. So looks like it&#039;s a keeper for us!"
430471,142067,2007-09-17,3,"This would have gotten a 5 star had I not had trouble with the recipe.  The flavor was great and worthy of 5 stars. But the dough was very sticky and I did have to add some more flour and it hardly rose at all. I will try this again, but I think next time, I might kneed the dough a little befor letting it rest."
540346,25885,2014-10-27,5,AMAZING!  MOIST!  DELICIOUS!  I used coconut oil in place of butter and I added some mini chocolate chips.  Wonderful!
573325,392465,2009-11-27,5,"Mmm, Karen, what a lovely cheesy sauce! I found it had a very nice tangy flavour and a perfect creamy consistency. The mozzarella made it somewhat different from other cheese sauces I have tried. What a yummy alternative!
I didnt have any chervil available and neither parsley or tarragon (the supermarkets were empty) and so I used fresh red basil from my own little plant. It was a really nice addition I thought.
Everything came together quickly and smoothly and was great on our pasta! :)
THANKS SO MUCH for sharing this wonderful recipe with us!
Made and reviewes for Veggie Swap #16 Novembre 09."
249529,136107,2005-10-21,3,This was delicious but was a bit tart. Maybe a bit of sugar in the dressing is needed?
54697,378924,2011-02-03,5,Excellent and easy!
198940,105829,2005-05-30,4,"This was a pretty good recipe. I made to round out the choices at a party we had. We had brisket, and pulled pork, so I made chicken too. It was tasty, but nothing really WOW about it."
199848,301840,2009-04-05,5,"Makes a great brunch dish!   Also, a great way to fancy up hard boiled eggs.  I used nice big sweet onions.  I loved it just as it is, but I may add some horseradish or mustard powder next time to add a little zing.   Thanx for a new use for hb eggs!"
360729,169071,2008-04-24,4,Very yummy! I loved the addition of the vegetables to a traditional sloppy joe sandwich. My husband liked these sandwiches even though he's not a big vegetable person. I will be making these again!
313120,85485,2006-07-04,5,"This was wonderful, doubled the recipe and added a can of cream of chicken soup and topped with Nan's Dumplings #31796.  Husband and son loved this, it is a keeper.  Thanks Marie."
98530,18437,2003-08-10,4,I made this for company and everyone raved about it. It was a hit! Very tasty!
676820,237542,2008-07-01,5,"I love a challenge. Actually, I made this because ofthe reviews :)  I added the buttermilk alternating it with the flour. Was very careful not to overmix it because THAT CAUSES IT TO NOT BAKE IN THE MIDDLE. I heated my oven to 350 and baked for abut 35-40 minutes (only because I personally like a darker crust). It was great! Good recipe wildflower, I'm keeping this one to make again."
1463971,442093,2010-11-20,0,This is a great dessert for chocolate lovers. I've been making this for years. A scoop of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream  to top it off makes it special and your guests will think you spent hours in the kitchen!
1058097,352805,2009-11-01,4,"I'm not sure if this is really easier or not.  You don't have to grind anything, but the pre-ground spices are much harder to remove from the pan than whole ones would be.  The seasoning mix is good, though, with a great Middle Eastern/North African flavor, and smells divine while the spices are toasting.  Made for My-3-Chefs, November 2009."
852529,169476,2009-08-03,3,"Good recipe, but I changed it up quite a bit.  I used some garlic powder and onion flakes because I had no onion.  I used Parmesean instead of Cheddar cheese.  Neither my husband nor I liked the ""stewed tomato"" all that much.  I think I'll leave the tomato out next time.  Thanks!"
396078,59672,2012-07-31,5,"My hubby made this recipe on Sunday night, so we could have an easy go-to dinner during the week.  The only thing was it barely survived one day in the fridge--because we gobbled it all up on Monday evening!  This smelled heavenly roasting in the oven and was just as pleasing to the eye.  The flavor combination of herbs, spices, raisins and parmesan/romano cheese was perfect.  We really enjoyed the texture the pine nuts contributed to the dish; although next time, I would lightly toast them before adding to the rice mixture.  I was worried that the peppers and tomatoes would disintegrate being cooked for so long, but they held together very nicely.  The rice was perfectly cooked and tender, and there was a good amount of ""sauce"" in the bottom of the pan to spoon over the peppers/tomatoes as they were served.  We love Greek food but have never had anything like this.  It was an amazing dish and certain to be a treasured addition to our recipe collection.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
67231,24351,2003-04-21,5,"This is without a doubt the best recipe I have tried from 'zaar to date! I made it exactly as the recipe is written. The spice combination is absolutely fantastic, very traditional Punjab food. I like it quite thin so added more water, served with fresh chapatis. EXCELLENT!!!"
987968,271008,2008-10-15,5,I doubled this for freezing for future use.  I used the one pie pumkin and 3 butternut squash.  I also doubled everything else.  Next time I will add about 1/2 tsp more garlic and 1 more onion. I also added 1/3 cup salt and then pepper to taste. I served it with heavy cream and it was excellent!  (This made a huge batch that I ended up cooking in my big nesco.)
2000194003,132469,2017-01-14,5,made this today and still in the canning process. Did a 6 fold batch as season is about over. We were out of the country until recently so couldn't do it earlier. Substituted 1/4 of the tomatoes with mangoes. We had to make a few other changes due to availability. I lost our previous recipe and found this. Both my wife and I agree this is far better then our previous. We add the mangoes toward the end so they don't break down. Thank you!
1414035,76864,2010-02-20,5,"Very good!  Turned out a little doey, baked at 350 for 14 mintues.  Next time i think i'll bake at 375 for 15 so they are cooked through!  Great recipe!"
538578,360654,2009-06-05,4,Very nice. Fans of this dip were very pleased. I liked the fact it had less oil and was full of flavour.
1951907,225416,2017-04-02,5,"I have my sour dough in its crock pot....if I'm not in the mood to make sour dough bread, and don't want to throw my starter out, which is hard for me to, I make this . I can't tell you how many times I have made it...it is easy and so delicious ?? I am diabetic, so I make this for friends and all I get are raves&quot;......?.easy to make ...if you are a sour doughista, make this. !!!!!"
486725,272737,2012-10-16,4,"Good side dish. I halved the lemon, quartered the chili powder and used just an 1/8 teaspoon of the salt. I think you could probably get away with a quarter of the lemon too."
440324,59898,2010-03-23,5,Excellent! A dressing that's both creamy and healthy...you can't go wrong with that. I used light feta and light buttermilk for a satisfying yet delicious salad meal. Thank you.
47892,31096,2010-05-19,5,"I cooked plain white rice separately. I know that's breaking tradition, but I prefer it that way. Anyway, these tasted very good. I lightly cooked white onion in a little of the bacon fat. Added the bell the last minute of cooking just enough to brighten the color. Then the onion and bell were added to a bowl with the remaining ingredients; garnished with cilantro on top. It went well with the white rice and fried plantains. Thanks, Bergy!"
122600,53499,2009-05-17,5,"Moist and delicious!  I made it with 3 bananas, no extra banana flavorings and I doubled the frosting.  I'll make this again."
1022482,84265,2010-03-06,5,Yummy! This one's a keeper thanks for sharing.
236959,56818,2008-07-18,4,"This was very good.  It made a ton, so next time I'll make only half the recipe, but I'll probably still use a full can of tomatoes because we felt it needed more.  Very quick, easy and healthy, so a keeper for me."
358796,215563,2007-05-13,1,"We felt that the olive oil flavor was overpowering, the appearance was very translucent and not appetizing, and it left an oily taste in the mouth."
22015,62749,2003-11-18,5,Wow!  This is like Chicken Cordon Bleu taken to the next level!  Great combination - very tasty.  I served with rice and steamed broccoli for a very nice meal.
447165,88939,2012-11-06,5,"That was good!  I hesitated to make this the first time I saw it, as the mayo seemed odd...but decided to try it today.  It's really good!  I made just a 1/4 recipe which was plenty for 4 smallish chicken breasts.  Moist & flavorful chicken.  Thanks!"
2001599616,446821,2017-06-25,0,Try adding some sour cream to the mix. It is delicious.
865620,308579,2009-03-21,5,"Love it!  This was easy and delicious!
I used seasoned frozen steak fries, but the result was still great!  I will definitely make this again!  Thank you!"
559886,40923,2007-11-01,4,zesty...tacoey.  Yummy.
2001384437,271482,2017-02-09,5,Great recipe. I used milk and mayo in place of the egg and water. It was much better that way.
37449,339284,2008-12-31,5,I halved the recipe and got about 3 servings. I also made this vegetarian by using meatless crumbles and vegetable broth. Thanks for a hearty soup!
2000413152,475554,2015-08-19,5,"Very good! I made this tonight for my guy and his friends, and they LOVED it. Just a tip...I wouldn&#039;t use double stuffed oreos on the topping. The extra cream made it a little rich for me. I will definitely make this again!"
371838,16311,2009-12-13,5,Excellent recipe-excellent texture made recipe exactly how it was written.  Will be making this again I am sure
456799,157032,2008-02-28,5,Oh my gosh is right! Absolutely loved this chicken. I made this to serve 6. I marinated the chicken all day in balsamic with olive oil and used whole eggs instead of egg whites. The  balsamic flavor was perfect. The only thing I will change next time is to cook the chicken on a rack so that both sides get crunchy. My family loved this and I cant wait to make it again. Thank you so much for posting this!
119466,137725,2005-12-06,5,"These are delicious--you did a fabulous job creating them! I doubled the recipe, using a heaping tablespoon of cocoa, smooth peanut butter, and the optional ground flax seeds. I am so happy I ran across this recipe--thank you for sharing it!"
290298,39522,2009-08-21,5,"Love this recipe,i would maybe add a tiny bit more sugar depending on what i was using it for .Definatly a keeper,Thankyou for posting"
1934436,440694,2014-04-28,5,I make this all the time- all year round with all kinds of fruit combinations! Last night I made it with strawberry rhubarb with a lattice top! Came out amazingly delicious ?
57222,133459,2005-09-17,5,"Ooh tigerduck, this is delicious!! I've always been told citrus goes well with lentils but I never got around to squeezing that lemon juice on top of my lentil soup - and boy have I been missing out! The addition of lime juice and zest is awesome! I didn't feel this needed any additional salt. Also, omitted the sultanas - not a big fan. :-) I can see how a sweet flavour would work with the spices and the zestiness of the lime, however. The yogurt is such a lovely addition as it rounds out the flavours beautifully, but I actually like this even as-is. I've now inhaled one portion of this and thrown three servings to the freezer - I'm looking forward to my lunches next week. Yummy! Thanks for a great recipe!"
2002040121,44278,2018-04-07,5,Really lovely....I added 500ml of cider instead of the water as well as some chopped leek....YUMMY! Although I did have to leave mine in or about 1 hour 20mins....it only read 140 at one hours cooking
2201308,474987,2012-03-04,5,Soo good!
1252036,323269,2009-08-11,5,I love an occasional vegetarian dish all meat is mundane. Use a BBQ sauce you love as it will effect if you like this dish or not. I did not have tomato puree so mixed tomato sauce and tomato paste
1176241,112133,2010-04-17,5,"very very good!  i made it as written, except instead of white beans i used a 15 bean & lentil mix (dried).  all three kids enjoyed it, as well as my husband and i. i think next time i make it i will make a double batch and freeze half (probably without the pasta) for a quick supper!  thank you for posting!"
165528,57369,2006-04-12,5,"We loved this recipe.  Put the spices on about four hours before we cooked it as a rub.  Wonderful combination of flavors!!!  I've never used paprika with allspice before - we'll do it again, though!  Thanks Yooper!! "
101823,187130,2007-07-20,5,"Excellent sandwich.  I used chicken breasts that had been grilled and seasoned with Montreal Steak Seasoning and subbed provolone for the mozzarella cheese.  I also had ciabatta style brat buns on hand and didn't do the panini thing just microwaved to heat through.  Hubby loved this quick, easy and flavorful sandwich."
89831,397572,2010-06-11,5,"Oh yum what a great easy recipe, I can't wait to give this a try, I may stick in a clove of fresh garlic and use spicy ketchup, great job Rose!"
260689,56694,2008-02-01,4,Made this in the crockpot - very easy and quick to make - the sauce is fabulous !!
391817,199160,2006-12-07,0,I can vouch! This is precisely how one of grandmother's fried chicken. I prefer using buttermilk but otherwise keep to the spirit of this recipe. I follow up with Tony Chachere's sprinkle. Shortening will give you considerably more crunch than vegetable oil. Always recycle shortening until truly done with or after frying fish. We like frying french fries after the chicken. Helps neutralize odors in your shortening and they taste great!
1817359,131018,2011-07-17,5,"A true family favorite... we have children 6 to 26 and all love the flavor.  Super easy, just plaed a 6 lb. shoulder roast after wathcing a movie late Saturday night.  I do not shred the meat after cookng for 12 hours but simply strain the meat and onions then remove and throw away the few remaining larger pieces of fat.  Place the big chumks of meat in the crock pot with Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.  Then occasionally stir the mixture and the recipe comes together nicely.  First time making this recipe I shredded the meat as instructed but the mixture was too fine and we appreciate the meatiness of the cooking method without shredding the meat.  The meat melds with the sauce perfectly.  Yum... nice meal tomorrow."
8629,2808,2003-09-27,5,"As good as any gourmet spread I've tasted.  With a food processor to chop the nuts and then mix the butter and honey, this spread can be put together in about 5 minutes or less. I made my spread using unsalted butter."
1833965,354086,2011-03-11,5,"Loved these!  Although what's not to love?  Cheese, potatoes, heaven.  :)"
398275,272427,2012-10-15,5,"I made this recipe to share with two of my fellow teachers for lunch.  One said, ""That lunch was amazing! It was so yummy. The spice level was great and I loved the noodles with it.""  The other said, ""That was fantastic!  Not too spicy and it had great flavor.""  Needless to say, we all enjoyed it!  This recipe is quick and easy to put together.  So flavorful.  Note to future reviewers:  I would highly recommend cooking the ramen noodles LAST.  If you make them first they turn into a congealed mass that is hard to separate, even when adding them to the sauce.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Chai Latte 2 Go!  ***Made for Fall PAC 2012***"
213909,63080,2010-06-18,5,Outstanding recipe! I used reduced sodium soy sauce to cut sodium and added no salt. Did everything else as stated. We were unable to grill so I used my grill pan. About 4 minutes on each side. ( I buy Alaskan wild caught individually wrapped fillets @ Sam's Club) I can;t wait to do it over charcoal. Thanks for sharing. :-0
970098,52206,2009-01-10,5,"I Love this recipe. My version includes 1/4 Splenda brown sugar in place of the white sugar, no butter, but 1 cup of homemade, unsweetened, chunky applesauce, and I use whole-wheat flour instead of white. Yummy!"
269331,63017,2010-05-04,5,"I always make my DadÃ¢â¬â¢s potato salad recipeÃ¢â¬Â¦ do not tell him but I think this may be my new potato salad recipe!  SHHHH!  I always have a problem with dry potato salad after it sits in the refrigerator, this one stayed nice and creamy even after 2 days!!!!   The only thing I changed was to reduce the amount of onion to 1 cup and omitted the sugar.  Do not like sweet potato salad.  Next time I may use horseradish mustard for an added kick.  FANTASTIC!"
209983,135831,2006-07-05,5,"This was really good, I did add a bit more garlic but followed everything else to the ""T"" Thanks for posting!"
123220,102115,2004-10-18,5,This is a winner. The only change I made was to substitute 3 small shallots for the red onion. I think it's best to chill overnight.
308765,360854,2010-08-30,5,"This was fantastic.  I added some chopped eggplant in place of mushroom.  I had to saute in two batches because it was too much for my small pan but was able to cook with the sauce in one batch.  I also had to cook the broccoli a bit longer, next time I'd chop it into small peices.  Next time I might add some garlic and ginger but it will definitely go into the rotation!"
1464858,180171,2009-11-27,5,"What a great recipe! 
I made some adjustments to it, but it still turned out amazing. 
I've used 5 legs only, added the basil leafs and garlic. Instead of adding the lemon slices, I just poured the lemon juice out of the whole lemon, and added about 1/3 glass of white wine. Baked it for 30-40 min on 375. And then 8min on each side on broil (500).  It was soooo goood!!! 
Thank you so much!"
2443409,486261,2012-10-11,5,I now have a new favorite recipe!  This meets all my food needs when I add a salad!  Great!
68894,27221,2003-07-22,5,"I made this for an engagement shower and everyone really liked it.  I added in a touch of balsamic vinagrette (sp?) and chopped green peppers, substituting in genoa salami and smoked gouda for an italian flavor.  Very tasty!!  Thanks for the recipe!"
52448,133888,2005-10-20,5,"We enjoyed this very much. I did sub mussels for the clams because they were too expensive here in Holland. There is nothing else I did different, I made it exactly as written."
65502,213566,2009-09-09,5,I marinated these for about 20 hours and made everything as listed. We have none left and they were delicious! I think I would cut back a bit on the peanut butter because it was pretty thick. Tasty as heck though! My DS used a lot of it on his Recipe #222271 that we had with the ribs. Made for Fall PAC. Thanks! :)
520644,469734,2012-08-25,3,Unfortunately We didn't care for these cookies.  The frosting was good but the actual cookie wasn't very lemony and was pretty bland.  Sorry for a first review to be such a downer! Made for ZWT8
85873,11209,2005-03-09,5,Excellent! Liked the look & taste of the celery seeds. Pureed the entire soup. Thanks Lorraine.
1351373,17149,2009-08-14,5,"I've made bread before but was kinda nervous about making cheesebread, this was delicious amazing and easy! Fantastic :)"
137749,350997,2009-02-27,5,"What a great way to be kind to yourself and lighten up, but not sacrifice on flavor! I used ground turkey but did everything else the same, other than using olive oil spray rather than olive oil to brown the turkey, which I'm sure lightened it up even more. Comfort food, made healthy...thanks!"
88390,38532,2010-02-03,5,"I just made these 2 days ago using garbanzo beans, quick oats, and a garlic herb rice mix I had cooked. These were FANTASTIC!! I just whipped up another batch using great northern beans. My entire family from my 1-1/2 yr old, 10 yr old and DH loved them as much as I did...Thanks so much for posting this!!"
2850874,114907,2013-06-04,5,Turns out perfect every time I make spring form pan. I do have to cook about 35 minutes longer than the recipe calls for. LOVE IT
2197533,474987,2012-02-29,5,Great idea. Best recipe!
53859,119507,2005-10-12,4,"This was very good.  We enjoyed it a lot.  The texture wasn't quite what I like in a fish cake, but the flavor pretty much made up for it.  I served with sour cream instead of gravy, and it tasted good.  We had boiled potatoes and steamed broccoli on the side.  Thank you!"
286566,190713,2012-01-12,5,WOW yes the flavours are intense but then I may have upped that due my :oops: moment I added the the lemon juice and most of the parsley in step 9 and then simmered (oh did not use cilantro/coriander as we don't really care for it) and also added about an extra 1/2 cup of stock to the simmer liquid but the big test was the DM she devoured hers and actually asked for seconds.  Served with recipe 44180.  Made for ZAAR Stars tag game.<br/><br/>Pat
1803334503,324118,2014-11-12,5,Excellent recipe!!! We omitted the chicken (so instead of an enfree salad it became a side salad to our actual entree: pork chops) and used crumbled goats cheese instead (but only because we couldn&#039;t find the cheese in the recipe at our grocery store)
386585,313707,2009-01-20,5,"This was light and lovely.  I used butter instead of margarine.  Unfortunately, I could not find cream of broccoli soup mix anywhere, so I used a can of Cream of Broccoli soup.  The texture was great and the flavor was rich.  I will be making this one again!  Made for PRMR Tag Game."
689332,322948,2009-02-23,5,My new favorite food! This didn't even make it into torillas. We ate it straight with a little cheese on top and it was amazing! Thanks for sharing.
89831,192851,2006-12-10,5,"This pie is a bit of work to put together, unfortunately my apples did not bake out in the specified cooking time, by then the topping was really hard, not a problem, we enjoyed the pie very much! thanks for sharing hon!...Kitten:)"
1041521,326219,2011-09-19,0,"I'm really excited about this recipe. No rating, though, because I did something wrong. They didn't rise for me. I don't have a bread machine, so did them by hand and I think I may have killed the yeast by adding it to the hot beer/honey mixture. I will try again because despite the density of the rolls, the flavor was fantastic!"
30534,38255,2003-06-08,4,"I loved the flavor contrasts - the slight bitterness of the livers, the sweetness of the wine and the spice of the herbs. I followed the recipe as written, using Penzey's Italian Herb Mix, fresh ground black pepper and no cheese. My only suggestion is to add fresh chopped parsley for color before serving.
My 4 star rating = very good, will make this again with no significant changes."
2001536450,499436,2018-10-29,0,It is a fantastic recipe but the flax seed has to be very fine and (i noted) better if one adds an egg. However you could try more flax seed powder
357222,125019,2008-11-12,5,Loved this recipe. Perfect for a hot summers day.  The dressing for the salad is out of this world.  Will definitely make this again and again.
220348,252769,2008-01-22,5,"This was really good, although not as pretty as Puppitypup's photo. But I really loved it. I used margerine instead of shortening, so I don't know if what the difference in taste was, but mine still cam out delicious."
425677,211709,2008-06-16,5,"This was very good.  I didn't quite cheat because I made my own Snitzels, but is was very good.  I had to cook them on top of the stove because I was cooking other things in the oven.  It made a wonderful Italian meal and very good left overs!  Thanks for posting.  Made for ZWT 4."
171790,81047,2007-11-15,5,This is really good lentil soup. I made it with the optional parsley and with balsamic vinegar. I'll be making this again and again. It was wonderful stepping throught the front door to the wonderful aroma of this soup.
481092,192201,2009-11-18,4,This was definitely comfort food.  I think it would be better with Italian sausage (hot variety) and adding peppers and mushrooms with the onions.  I would say serves 6-8 easily.
201581,209875,2007-02-26,5,"All I can say is WOW! I used ""lite"" canned fruit and Splenda brown sugar for the filling, and kept the regular sugar in the pastry dough. The filling was very festive tasting, the pastry was flaky and tender. I can see this on a Thanksgiving or Christmas menu. Made for Review My Recipe Tag. Thank you for a very lovely recipe Sydney Mike!"
2200124,497295,2013-03-15,0,love this recipe!
2289246,177316,2012-06-09,5,You wouldn't be using a Cameron StoveTop Smoker by any chance??  Yep. We make this all the time.  The sauce I usually have to make double. We use the sauce  on plain rice. It's Excellent!
2000360849,264447,2015-07-25,5,Added garlic. Cooked at 400 for 30 minutes. Delicious!
177933,17586,2006-11-15,5,"Couldn't be easier and tasted great!  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I used 8 large corn tortillas, I dipped them into the enchilada sauce to soften them and then filled-em and rolled-em up.  I know I used more than 2 cups of cheese, but I didn't measure.  We topped them with lite sour cream and habanero sauce.  Thanks!"
227607,307562,2008-06-14,5,Made for ZWT4...This was a very easy recipe to make for lunch.  I had some leftover bacon that I had made for breakfast so it was very quick to make.  I used a George Forman grill for it and it worked perfectly.
317017,19952,2009-08-13,5,"I wouldn't call this fudge, but it is divine!  I made a half batch last night (because I didn't want to eat it all myself, lol) and it came out perfect.  I am making another full size batch now to take to a friends house and for a party I am off to on Saturday night.  
I melted the peanut butter and white choc in a saucepan and did the dark choc in the microwave.  So quick and easy, yet it looks a million dollars!  Will be making this at Christmas this year.  Thanks for posting!"
15521,378931,2010-02-18,5,"This is a great, simple dish that packs a lot of flavor.  I made this ahead for my husband to reheat, and he gave it high marks.  I used some kielbasa in place of the chorizo, as that is what I had.  I'd love to try the chorizo as well."
33159,151246,2006-03-15,5,"Very tasty potatoes!  The paprika & pepper gave them a little bit of a kick.  And, I just realized now - I forgot the garlic - duh!  Oh well, now I'll have to make them again properly.  Instead of the oil, I used Becel Topping & Cooking Spray - potatoes still got crispy without the added calories from the oil."
1076383,138062,2010-07-17,5,"Delicious Recipe!  Thanks for sharing!  I have made it the way it is written and also a few times with the twist of changing out the banana pudding for coconut pudding and using coconut milk instead of buttermilk.  Yummy both ways!  Thanks, again!"
176615,210742,2012-11-17,5,Simple and very good. Lots of flavor from the smoked chicken. Made an easy dinner with a green salad. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
1344790,76491,2011-01-27,5,"This is so quick and easy to make, and also delicious!"
692025,102617,2012-01-05,5,Seriously good.  Don't leave out the celery seed!
131126,202541,2009-07-22,3,"This salad has lots of positives.  It is laden with vegetables, brightly colored, and has a very light & fresh taste.  I made a reduced amount to sample the salad & next time would do a few things differently, but they are strictly personal preference.  Others may love the clean taste just as written.  I would substitute some of the vegetables with others, possibly green or red onion and red peppers. I would also reduce the oil.  It would lower the calories & still have enough to coat the salad.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!"
53932,106872,2010-03-18,4,These were quite tasty.  I did bake longer to achieve a crispier effect
113091,156685,2006-02-28,5,"Quick, easy and tasty!  A nice light dish.  I omitted the onions, added black olives and only used half a cup of dressing.  This would be a fantastic for when you need a quick potluck dish!"
165707,35722,2004-10-28,5,"My Mother and Aunt are from a polish family and refer to these rolls as ""Gowumki"".  They learned how to make them from their polish relatives.  They had no recipe to follow.  I had them try these, and they agree, these are excellent.  Microwaving the cabbage makes it very easy.  Thanks Bill for writing it down.  Now I can pass it along to my children."
68460,92145,2011-07-17,5,"Very delicious!  I used one can of low sodium beef broth, plus about a cup of water and a beef boullion cube.  My husband smelled the aroma, came into the kitchen and said ""mmm, Okazu"" (sp?).  He's Japanese, he said his Grandmother made something like this, minus the noodles, they served it over rice.  So, he added shoyu to his portion and loved it, LOL.  I loved it too.  I'm definitely making this again as it's quick, cheap and easy and the husband gets his Okazu!!  Comfort food for me!  Thanks for the recipe Boy of Dee's :)"
135470,344013,2013-01-27,5,"Delicious! My only changes were to use butter ( I can't imaging using margarine) and topped with sugar crystals instead of powdered sugar. I used slightly defrosted cranberries which I cut in half before adding to the dough, I might increase the amount next time because we really enjoyed the flavor and there was room for more. I cut them scone style, and taste and texture wise they are more scone then biscuit. Thanks for a great recipe Sharon. Made for PRMT."
403223,43396,2006-12-10,5,"Made this recipe last night and both DH and I loved it. I am not a big sausage person, but this was really good. We reheated the leftovers for lunch and they came out great."
68960,42902,2006-03-30,5,"This is so easy.  I used my toaster oven and toasted both sides of the bread.  Then rubbed garlic all over, sprinkled with a touch of veggie salt, olive oil and chopped parsley, topped with finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese, put back into the toaster oven to melt cheese.  Amazing and a recipe I will use often. Thanks for posting."
2905841,209385,2013-12-03,2,Don&#039;t like the sugar and cin.  And if you fry the bread on one side first then flip and add the egg yolk it is much better. My dad was Italian and they call it man on a raft.
632249,451525,2013-08-26,5,"I had leftover steak so I gently heated it with a bit of beef broth while I cooked the onions/peppers in another pan.  I must confess to adding cheese to the buns as they were &lt;br/&gt;broiling....we love cheese!  A nice recipe for a hot summer night, thank you!"
130819,382897,2011-04-07,5,Excellent! The ingredients came together to make for great flavour making for one awesome tasting steak.Your dad's marinade is almost identical to one I have been making up for years and years - had always planned on jotting down as I went but that didn't happen ... and now I have it on paper and in my Family Favorites Cookbook. Thank you for sharing your dad's recipe.
429374,38298,2007-02-06,5,"i absolutley enjoyed making this soup, it was great. Just to let you know i went the other day to olive garden and asked what type of green they use and they use koboli and cheyenne pepper!"
2089043,135272,2018-09-20,1,Seemed really slimy using flour and butter. Ended up washing the coating off fish and seasoning with lemon and butter. Keep it simple and broil with simple butter. Would not make again.
1351845,46922,2013-04-03,5,"I was skeptical when I read adding brown sugar and yellow mustard but this ham really is yummy! I made this for company and everyone loved it and the leftovers are just as good. I have never made a ham before and what made it so great was the fact that you leave it out to rest for th last hour. The ham did not get cold like I thought it would and it gave me enough time to put the asparagus, stuffed mushrooms and macaroni and cheese in the oven. Everything was done and hot at the same time! GREAT RECIPE!!!!!!"
8629,103276,2004-12-31,5,Easy to make.  The truffles stay soft even after being refrigerated.  They tasted great.
320994,179000,2007-03-06,4,"Tasty and extremely easy.  The most time consuming part was grilling and cutting up the chicken, but using my George Foreman grill made that part easier than I thought it would be.  One I'll make again for sure!"
321410,48401,2006-10-04,5,Thank you! Was gone by the end of the night. I'd never thought of combining what I grew up calling creme caramel with a rich chocolate cake. What a delightful result! 
111291,24952,2008-02-11,5,"I made this today to use when making www.recipezaar.com/17904 today. Made just as posted, except I didn't have bouillion powder, so I just used boullion cubes and some brown gravy dry mix and then placed all ingredients into the food processor. Perfect! Much better than the ""real"" stuff! Will make this to keep on hand at all times!"
230672,19611,2006-04-04,4,It is a good funnel cake but it needs to be thinned down just a bit.Very simple to make.
1110613,386824,2010-09-26,4,"So, I nearly gave these cookies a bad review because I tried them after they came out of the oven and they just weren't good.  But I decided to try the advice of a couple of other reviewers and try them cold.  They are SO MUCH better after being in the refrigerator overnight.  For some reason, they had a sour taste coming out of the oven.  That seems to go away after they are cooled.  <br/><br/>I topped some of the cookies with drizzled chocolate and I baked a batch of them with blackberry jam dropped in the middle.  The jam ones are, by far, my favorite."
1067479,477371,2013-01-20,3,"I thought this was good, my husband and father in law didn't like the marmalade peel flavor very much.  I used the home made marmalade with half sugar and half Splenda so maybe I didn't get that right. I'd like to try it again, with less marmalade and maybe add some ginger.  We all thought it might be better served over rice or noodles as a lo mein to perhaps enhance the flavors."
91584,128310,2011-01-04,5,Lemon pie perfection! Thanks!
54067,65304,2003-06-22,5,My kids can't get enough of McDonalds parfaits so I was thrilled to find this money saving recipe. The kids say it's as good as McDonalds
957932,93797,2008-12-21,5,"Quick, easy, DELICIOUS.  I served this chilled and topped with whipped cream to a few of my girlfriends at a movie party and they were all asking for seconds.  They've each asked that I email them the recipe.  I will definitely be making this one again.  Two modifications: I used 3/4 cup of sugar and a dash of nutmeg."
10033,56030,2003-08-23,5,"Susan Lee was right--this was worth the extra time. I followed this recipe mostly to a ""T,"" but I did add a little more garlic in the sauce and stuffing. I didn't use any fresh basil or parsley because I forgot to add them! I am serving this with Tish's Garlic Soup as an appetizer and a nice red wine. THANKS for posting--I will make this again and again! "
83400,84324,2005-02-01,5,"This is a tasty aloo gobi. I added 1 teaspoon ground goriander, and use 4 cloves garlic and a 1"" piece of ginger.  Thamks for posting."
500849,97496,2007-08-25,5,"I took these to work and all you could hearwas ""OOOOOOOOO"", ""YUM""- they are such a nice change from chocolate chips!! Very buttery and delicious - a definite 5 star recipe.  I actually got more cookies than the recipe indicated - I made 2 "" balls and got 44 cookies - they were great!!"
240552,95032,2008-03-15,5,"Awesome and easy chicken!!  I didn't have the mushrooms for the bottom.  I also used a defrosted chicken and put it in for about 6 hours on low.  I made this  up with Recipe #282426.  It was so moist and flavorful.  I've got all kinds of ideas for the lefovers, too!  Thanks, MizEmerilLagasse!"
2001795411,42322,2017-11-14,5,"The BEST! I have baked bread for decades. The gluten free thing is fairly new to me I do it for my great-grandson .Most breads have turned out l like paper weights or worse. I made these at 3:30 in the morning so I could destroy the evidence without anyone (my hubby) being any wiser. When they come out of the oven I thought WOW these rolls look great! Not like petrified dinosaur droppings as many do. After building up my courage I tried one. OMGoshness! Fantastic!! A must have for all gluten free bread-lovers. I will try it in a loaf pan next. THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!"
327445,33665,2006-11-29,5,"This is very good! I used chicken instead of beef and didn't use gravy, and it was still excellent! Thanks for the recipe!"
217226,25723,2005-12-26,5,"Everybody loved these! They were very easy to make and got gobbled up just as fast! I doubled the recipe, and my tiny little rolls - I didn't count them - perfectly filled my 8-inch round cake pan. As other reviewers suggested, I brushed some melted butter on before sprinkling the sugar and cinnamon, and next time I'll bake a little longer becuse these were still kind of doughy after 12 minutes. They tasted very good though!"
1345872,91827,2009-08-08,5,"It has been a long time since I have been so enthousiast about a recipe, and with a reason. This is one of the bestest pizza crust and pizza sauce I ever tasted. As many suggest: use less fat in the pan (a smal layer was good enough for making it goldbrown). I and my family enjoyed this so much. (I used the pizza hut deep pan barbecue topping)  Thanks a lot!"
35635,377777,2009-09-10,5,"This is a really interesting combo of flavours. I really liked it served with multigrain tortilla chips, my husband not so much so. Since this made a lot, I tried baking some chicken topped with the salsa and a light coating of jack cheese - it turned out really nice, we both enjoyed it very much. Added a lot of flavour, visual interest and not so many calories. Made for PAC Fall 2009."
119466,66412,2005-04-05,5,"I made this recipe out of Cooking Light & it really is just fabulous! The sauce is incredible. I was considering posting it and when I did a search, I found you had already done the work---thanks for posting!"
330545,60510,2007-06-22,5,"Made a double batch up for a backyard bash.  A favorite with the older GKs...22-24 years of age...  Thanks Rita, another winner.  ZWT3"
242729,71273,2010-09-06,5,"Another satisfied customer! I made the full amount and put portions in  the freezer, the taste is subtle and FULL of flavour. I made mine with fresh tomatoes and I will be making more soon - a wonderful recipe that will be my standard Italian sauce from now on! Merci Darllnk! ;-)"
96358,38641,2008-06-23,4,I used the mini loaf pans and froze them!
619939,289104,2009-09-29,0,Over all.......Great! Deliciousness!
65197,173268,2006-06-25,5,"Ok, this stuff is good!
Do we have to wait 2 weeks??  This is going to be fantastic in my bbq beans this year!!
Thanks Cheryl!"
379836,94528,2008-02-06,5,I made this as loaf. I also added wheatgerm since I wasn't going to add any nuts (school lunch). I absolutely loved it! Even picky eater ate it. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing. I didn't add cinnamon too but I think it would still have been fantastic without it. Very easy to make too.
118023,38631,2004-09-15,4,"Yummy! I did a marinade of honey and soy sauce with the chicken before cooking.  Next time I will remove the skins as it was too greasy.  Also, I will add some salt to the chicken before browning next time, needed a little more flavor.  I may also add some diced, partially-cooked carrotts to step 5, I think they'll absorb the flavors nicely. Very yummy, will be on my list to make again!"
2000230628,116597,2015-05-27,1,Bleh. Most bland and dry brownies ever.   Next batch I&#039;ll try with oil and water like a regular brownie mix.  And add choc chips.  Hopefully they&#039;ll have some sort of flavor.  So sad.
678298,24525,2016-02-03,5,Excellent easy had all ingredients on hand. Great in my taco salad.
232886,264533,2008-01-09,3,"These muffins are very good, but the title is misleading. They really should be called Mushroom and bacon breakfast muffins, because the mushrooms are predominant.

That said, the recipe was easy, the muffins rose and cooked well, and they taste good. I didn't have any chives, and I really think they would add something to the recipe. Or I may add a little dill next time I make these.

I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup plain flour. Also, there's a lot of juice left after cooking the mushrooms, so I just drained that off."
50969,116269,2008-07-22,4,"I was looking for a recipe that  was low in carbs and I came across this one. I made this on 7/21/08 for mine and my SO's dinner. And I have to tell you this recipe got a "" good solid four"" from both myself and my SO.However we both thought that this recipe could have used some salt.Other than that, this will be made again.Thank you for posting and, ""Keep Smiling :)"""
699079,244193,2010-10-10,5,"This was one of the best cheesecakes I've ever tasted!  It was light and fluffy, not too sweet, and just melted in your mouth.  Made it for a dinner party and it got rave reviews.  In fact, my husband thought I bought it and didn't believe me when I said I made it!  I used powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar (because I ran out), but other than that, I followed the recipe perfectly.  Great recipe!!!"
327281,176586,2007-10-06,5,"I loved this salad.  Very good combination of herb flavours, and just the right amount of dressing to flavour the rice without drowning it or making it soggy.  I would call it ""herby"" rather than ""spicy"", though.  This salad would be fabulous with crumbled feta cheese.  Reviewed for Pick A Chef, Fall 2007."
457661,108375,2009-02-17,5,YUMMY!! I never bake/fry my meatballs first and I was looking for a recipe that would give me moist meatballs as mine were never perfect...this is it! The secret must be in the white bread because that's the only thing different from my method. I used fresh garlic and a little fresh basil I had frozen/chopped and some dried to make up the difference. I used my own sauce. This is my new go-to recipe for meatballs. Thanks so much for posting!
251917,407299,2010-01-13,5,Christmas Recipe Tag 2009: Kate - this is so delicious! What a nice & tasty variation on stuffed potatoes!
80353,94562,2004-11-14,4,Great sandwich!  Used regular mayo - loved the honey-mustard-mayo combo and will be using it for many other sandwich combos.
73836,221430,2007-08-26,5,"I made this lovely bread yesterday and I have to say it was really close in taste and texture to the bread my ex husband used to make.  I had no problems with it at all.  It was realy in less than two hours and it really was lovely.  I never had the problem of it being excessively huge like the other reviewer either.  It was just a lovely loaf of bread, plain and simple. I will be making this often.  Thanks!"
201581,8109,2011-02-15,5,"Made this with sourdough rye bread from the bakery, very heavy. It made a substantial meatloaf that didn't fall apart on me. No caraway seeds but I always have celery seed, and used beef broth instead of beer. Very unique flavor and leftovers will be great in sandwiches. Thanks for sharing Julesong. Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag."
292507,17586,2007-07-26,5,"This was very good and very easy, I only baked it for 25 minutes because the sauce and the cheese were starting to burn. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef because it is lower in fat but taste just the same. Will make again!!"
208158,69630,2010-06-09,5,"I made this cake today w/a few changes: used a french vanilla box cake, omitted the almond extract (can't stand it) & substituted vanilla.  Cut it down by half, too.  It was a trial run for my girls' BD cake and came out wonderful.  It tasted divine, is moist but also dense enough to hold its form.  I used a Wilton Elmo cake pan and it was just a bit more than full when done.  I will make it for their upcoming birthday for sure!  Thank you for a wonfderful recipe :0)"
766347,153953,2008-02-17,5,What a great and easy recipe.  We go to a local oriental cafe every week and this is just as good if not better.  Easy to prepare
68727,50684,2003-02-09,5,Wonderful buttery cookies with a flakey texture that were not too sweet (just like PetitFour described them).  The flavor of these cookies reminds me of those Danish butter cookies that come in a round tin and are sold mostly during the holidays.  My kids loved these cookies.
752082,168763,2011-12-25,5,Had this chili for Christmas dinner.  It was SO good!  A bit on the sweet side so if you like chili with a kick this isn't for you.
496803,272831,2009-08-16,4,"Easy and very good!  This made a nice dinner for one, with enough leftovers to be a side dish for one the next day.  I couldn't find eggplant at my local grocery, so I substituted mushrooms instead.  The only other change I made was to add some chopped garlic.  The goat cheese really added a nice tang to this dish, without making it overly cheesy, and the pasta sauce added just enough moisture to keep the other ingredients from drying out in the oven.  This is a definite make again, although I will add some herbs and seasonings next time."
152402,25415,2005-06-26,5,"Easy recipe to make, but I had to change the recipe slightly too because I can't eat spicey food.  So instead of the hot sauce, I just added a few dashes of tabasco sauce.  I'm sure my husband would have perfered the original recipe.  My version was ok, but what was really good, was the chicken breast that I also marinated in the sauce, it was a great chicken marinade the way I made it.  I am sure we will be making it again next time we bbq."
1171764,286777,2011-11-21,0,Great salad that was different from others.  I left out the jalapenos as my grandchildren would be eating it and they loved it.  Definitely a keeper.
306542,275496,2008-03-06,5,Mmmm very tasty.  I was looking for an egg nog recipe without eggs and this was a great find.  Even people who swore they would never even taste soy milk really liked it. I love it when a recipe even appeals to the pickiest palates in my family.  I will definately pass this on to my sister in law who can't have dairy.  Thank you for the recipe.
103809,47384,2005-08-18,5,"While I personally didn't get to try this one, it was definitely a popular offering at my daughter's wedding reception, with lots of requests for the recipe."
394077,172700,2010-01-02,5,This is so good.  Very delicious.  I reduced the sugar to 2 tablespoons but kept the rest of the recipe as written.  EXCELLENT drink.
296809,57339,2006-10-25,5,"DH & I are in Dallas visiting SusieQusie, we had a dinner party last nite for 14 & SQ made this for our dessert. This may well be the best dessert I've ever tasted & it got universal sighs of bliss from our guests - a true taste sensation! She made it in a springform pan at my suggestion & serving it was challenging, but I'll leave that for her review. All I can think about is how utterly divine it tasted & how deserving it is of 10*! Our thx to you & SQ for sharing this yummy dessert w/us."
330545,41303,2007-12-04,5,Very good!
126104,186757,2006-10-29,3,"This came out fairly bland.  I added quite a bit of salt (and some pepper), and it was better.  The directions didn't say whether to add chicken to the sauce; add sauce to the chicken; serve sauce over chicken.  

Sorry I couldn't rate this better.  

"
1217784,97573,2010-05-03,4,"While I thought this was quite good, it was not as tasty as the butter chicken I have enjoyed at Indian restaurants.

I made slight modifications to the recipe in order to sharpen the flavor of the sauce.  I added more spices including far more turmeric than the recipe called for and added sugar to sweeten the sauce.  I also put the raw chicken in the sauce and allowed it to simmer for a few hours on the stove top, instead of following the original instructions. I did not add cornstarch or water and used ghee instead of peanut oil."

  I also though this would be a good crockpot recipe,so I used my crockpot and it was delicious.And I too just bought my first Adobo Seasoning, I wasn't sure I would know what to use it on so I looked up recipes on zaar and yours was one I decided to use. Thanks for a wonderful sunday dinner.

881977,4292,2009-06-27,5,"For me, this was perfect!  Not too much zing but plenty of flavor.  My husband, who prefers zippy things, complimented me on it and the kids all had extra helpings.  Definitely will keep this one on hand!"
2189840,83950,2012-02-21,0,"This is an incredible recipe. The flavors are so complex and it's such a hearty and tasty sauce. This is my now go to Bolognese recipe. The only change I made was instead of adding the salt, I added the rind of some left over Parmigiano-Reggiano and let it simmer with the sauce, then removed before serving. (I got this idea from Rachel Ray, and it adds a wonderful flavor to any pasta sauce). Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe. My family and I thank you."
2737371,497021,2013-03-15,5,Loved this recipe!
222970,71205,2010-12-11,0,Very delicious and a good way to transport six quarts of mashed potatoes to a party!
380162,76930,2009-10-20,4,"This was really tasty, we enjoyed it! :) We followed the recipe exactly except I cut up the chicken into 1 inch pieces before cooking in the pan instead of leaving as whole breasts. I then cut them up even thinner when I served them. Yum yum!"
143721,245136,2010-06-19,5,"Just like the sandwiches I use to get when I lived in England.  Bread, butter and home made strawberry jam, how much better can it get?  I used potato bread and recently made jam.  Made for ZWT6 Voracious Vagabonds."
740619,98724,2008-02-18,0,I have  loved these for years using Louisiana Creole tomatos with mayonaise. Recently tried with pickled okra and it really brought out the mater taste. Up a notch when I thought that it could not get any better.
1800519126,253022,2013-12-07,5,"I made this for a birthday party and it was a hit! I tried to cut calories a bit and used egg substitute and sugar free pudding. I used my mixer a bit to combine the cake mix, pudding and wet ingredients. The mix was thick due to the pudding. I used a spoon to mix in the nuts and chips. The batter needs to be spread out in the pan. I cooked it for 45 mins and it was great. A sure keeper recipe."
165304,62916,2004-10-21,5,"These potatoes are wonderful.  I made a HUGE bowlful to serve  family-style with beef stew...they should be called Cecile's VANISHING Creamy Mashed Potatoes...because that's what happened to them!  And I had hoped for some leftovers to make potato patties for this morning's breakfast...maybe I'll make some more, just for me!... Grammy Bummy"
94675,98910,2005-03-13,5,"Excellent! very moist. Will make this again.
Thanks"
1072593,366665,2011-10-08,5,Burrito Bowls...another reason for me to move to Mexico and set up camp in Mamacita's kitchen.  Subbed Mexican rice and made for PAC Fall 2011.
179133,116269,2009-10-03,5,Very tasty! Followed the recipe exactly (using ketjap manis) and generous amounts of the pepper & nutmeg.  My bacon tried to come off while these were browning but I didn't worry about it too much. Served with recipe #83825 tonight but will be trying one of the leftover ones on a bun with ketchup & mustard. Thanks for the recipe!
237123,101585,2006-09-07,5,"Love it!  This is one of the best things to have come out of my crockpot in a long time! It is so easy to make, too.  I was able to put it all together quickly when I stopped home at lunch time and it was perfect for a fast dinner when I had less than a half hour in between work and school a few hours later.  It tastes great, and the squash and wild rice were cooked just right.  The flavors were right on and it did not turn out mushy, which seems to happen with quite a bit of veggies from the crockpot. Thanks, Sharon123 for posting this and for suggesting it to me!  This is a keeper for sure."
56599,13863,2002-10-02,4,"These were good & well-received at a church function. I'd suggest dissolving the yeast in a tiny bit of water with 1 tsp. sugar, since it didn't dissolve completely into the dough.
Also, the stiff egg whites made the nut mixture quite runny (did the Ellis Island immigrants have mixers?)Next time I would add  unbeaten egg whites slowly until the mixture is a good spreading consistency. These were similar to nut horns my aunts made many years  ago in Cleveland using Hungarian recipes."
652564,177242,2011-07-27,5,I love this recipe! It is so easy to make and absolutely delicious! Thanks for posting it!
442988,86653,2007-08-10,5,"I really want to give this 4.5 stars, but I'll round up ... I'm very grateful to you for sharing a recipe that uses both spinach and mushrooms, but doesn't involve 3 pounds of cheese!  I wanted something light, and this was it.  I used cremini mushrooms, and I switched to a half cup of reduced-fat Jarlsburg and a half cup of first-rate Parmesan-Reggiano.  My reservation is that there was so much mushroom liquid in the pan when I pulled it out of the oven, and that was a little unpleasant ... but I didn't poach my mushroom caps before baking, so that might have been the problem.  (I wanted them to have plenty of body when they came out of the oven.)  Next time I'll make it exactly as written and see if that reduces the liquid.  Thanks for posting this!"
497288,10125,2011-07-24,5,"Fantastic cookies. Years ago I had cookies similar to this and when I asked for the recipe I remember they had pudding mix in them.  Well I lost the recipe and found this one. I am so happy I filtered through many chocolate cookie recipes to get it. I only used 1/2 cup chocolate chips due to personal preference,  These cookies come out soft not crunchy.  I have also used instant pistachio pudding mix and it also comes out great."
98919,56103,2014-03-11,5,I can&#039;t believe I forgot to rate these! Add another 5 stars from my family. A keeper for sure!
542159,313885,2009-06-10,5,Very yummy! Was delight with the fresh taste the basil brought and tickled that the tomato made it moist enough that no mayo was needed. Great lunch thanks so much for the post.
482376,488748,2018-08-19,5,"This was such a yummy salad. I'd never thought to pair oranges with avocados in a salad before. It's a great combination! This salad recipe was a snap to prepare, too. A win-win! Made for Susie's World Tour 2018 - Austrailia"
743738,390096,2009-11-20,5,Perfect for a healthy muffin.  I added extra spices of allspice and ginger.  Also used butter and dark brown sugar.  Mini-muffins cooked in oven for about 15 min (maybe less).  The texture is great - lightyly crisp on outside and soft and moist on inside.  I'm also trying this as a loaf - I'll let you know how it cooks...  Thanks!  My 2 & 3 year olds love them.
37449,325601,2009-01-08,5,I made this leaving out the alcohol and really enjoyed it! Thanks!
55655,34664,2003-11-15,4,"Very easy and quite tasty. I added a few onions as well. Cooking times are right on - vegetables remained nicely crisp-tender. I did marinate the tofu a little longer (25 min), so it would pick up more of the flavour."
91392,438091,2011-04-03,4,A quick dinner and a change from the usual.  Very rich.  I might be more likely to use it as an appetizer.  Esy and inexpensive to do.
21752,54699,2005-05-12,5,"An absolutely fantastic sweet dough!  I used soymilk to make it non-dairy, but that was the only change I made.  This made enough dough to roll out for three sets of spiral rolls, which I made by just spreading some apple and cinnamon jam on the rolled-out dough.  Rolled up the dough, cut the rolls into spirals and baked in a 350 degree F oven for about 45 minutes.  They were a huge hit.  I can't wait to try out the dough for other yummy things (I'm thinking Skor bits....)."
166642,184192,2009-03-19,5,These are so good! I made just as stated and my very picky son raved about them. He went back for seconds and that's saying something for him. I will definitely keep this on my tried and true recipes to make over and over again. Thanks for sharing!
305743,59895,2010-04-08,0,"These were good, but evidently I did NOT cool the chocolate mixture down enough as the chips melted.. More like a chocolate candy type brownie.. I will try again, only making half of the recipe as this pan is more for feeding a potluck or bake sale group.."
258050,103971,2006-09-29,5,"This is an AMAZING chili recipe!!! Actually I haven't tried the recipe exactly as written, but the version I came up with based on it I think is amazing! Like most people I used kidney beans and not pink beans. I used a green pepper and a red pepper. After step 1 I added a few tsp of white wine and let cook a bit longer. After step 6 I added about 1/4 of a cup of my favorite BBQ sauce which I think adds a lot to the chili, thikening it up a bit and giving it some extra flavor. After adding the beans, I mashed about half of them to make the overall texture of the chili more thick. I also can't stress enough how much cooking for a long time adds to the recipe, I usually let it cook for like 3 hours if possible. I still add the zucchini after 90 minutes, because I think I like the texture better when it softens more."
194886,116223,2007-04-01,5,"This is a wonderful, simple dish that's so simple to put together!! I'll serve it again, even my picky dd that hates eggplant ate it and ate seconds! I didn't specify the flavor of cruton to my dh when he went shopping and he brought home garlic ones. So then I added a couple of minced garlic cloves to it as well. I crushed the larger crutons and sprinkled parmesan cheese on the top. It was really delicious and I'll definatly  make this one again, perhaps for a family shindig because I have vegetarians on either side of the family! Thank you so much for a great recipe Parsley!

*Update* I still love this recipe, I've added new things for a bit of a change of pace, I've added in addition to the regular cheese some Parmesan cheese. I've used thyme or Italian seasoning as well. This is still a wonderful recipe and now a favorite in my household."
13796,43057,2010-07-11,5,Oh we loved it... I would add some cornstarch to the sour cream/ chicken broth mixture to try to thicken it up just a little bit...    MMmm....   this was / is a KEEPER!!
1351560,415812,2013-05-28,0,So glad you posted this recipe ~ we checked out this book about a year ago and forgot to record this recipe~  who knew how good almond extract and sunflower seeds compliment blueberry muffins!
1825340,187317,2012-01-24,5,"This orange chicken was great.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I added a little bit of soy sauce and used a few splashes of sesame oil with the vegetable oil.  My 3 kids and husband loved the chicken too.  I'm happy to have a new go to recipe that pleases everyone, using ingredients that I pretty much have on hand.  Thanks!"
2910864,37017,2013-12-24,1,This recipe calls for way too much salt. It didn&#039;t clog my injector at all. I used regular salt.
225114,154635,2006-05-26,4,"This was really good idea, and it tasted really good, but I think it needed a little less water with a little more oats.  It was a little runny.  We loved it though, and will try it again soon with the slightly different measurements."
452355,229709,2017-11-07,3,"This was easy and fast on a weeknight where we had most ingredients on hand. Subbed shredded purple cabbage for Napa cabbage and I think this worked just fine. We didn't love it enough to make again, but it wasn't bad."
1064617,46739,2011-10-13,5,"WOW!  This is PHENOMENAL!  I LOVE it.  It makes a lot, so I'm sure you could cut in half and have extra.  Seriously.  Make this.  You will not regret it!  (For the salmon I broiled with a little salt, pepper, & garlic powder for about 13 minutes and it was perfect)."
406741,148138,2010-10-03,3,This was okay. I love mayo so I was surprised I didn't care for it. I added dill before serving and that made it a bit more interesting.
31688,18523,2002-02-21,4,This was very easy to make and tastes delicious!
55578,8595,2006-03-26,5,Excellent!  
1662835,85504,2010-08-08,5,"These THIN buttermilk pancakes are probably the best I've ever had.  I see all the substitutions with additional flour - if you are looking for traditional fluffy pancakes look for a different recipe, these are meant to be thin and there are outstanding 'fluffy' buttermilk recipes on this site.  These are difficult to cook because the batter is thin so be sure to use a little less than you would normally on the griddle.. also don't overload the fruit or chips you add or the pancakes break when you attempt to flip them."
37449,314364,2008-08-04,5,"I loved this lemonade! I did make one change, I used pineapple chunks in juice, blending them in the blender and adding to the lemonade. So good on a hot 94 degree day! Thanks Annacia!"
498271,177327,2009-01-25,5,"This chicken is OUTSTANDING! Extremely flavorful, tender and delicious, and so easy! I used the full 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes which gave this just the right amount of kick without overpowering all of the other wonderful flavors. Cooked it outdoors over charcoal and it was perfect. Can't say enough about this delicious chicken - thanks for posting this winner!"
1436969,267272,2010-06-01,4,"thought this was pretty good, but next time i will make it with peach pie filling instead of the apple. i'm not a huge apple pie fan, so i think i will really like the peach. also, i didn't want to go to the trouble of cutting this cake into individual pieces to top with the caramel sauce, so i simply sliced the cake in the cake pan and poured the sauce all over the cake. it soaked down into the pieces because of the cuts and was super gooey and yummy on top! we also ate ours with a caramel swirl ice cream for even more sweetness & it was awesome!"
99785,101459,2007-10-22,5,These were so good.  I let the syrupy stuff cool before handling & had no problem.  I liked them right after they were made.  My husband & kids liked them after they sat out over night & got hard & crunchy.  We will be making these every year at Halloween.
37449,188461,2008-06-25,5,Very nice! I got canned smoked salmon from Sam's club. I quartered the recipe. My DH and I enjoyed it on crackers. Thanks Kiwi!
576273,87420,2012-03-16,5,YUMMY! the boyfriend whipped this up and added onions to it and seasoned things a little bit with Oklahoma Joe's Rib Rub #118966. absolutely fork tender and served over plain ol white rice. and everything we had on hand. Thanks for a wonderful recipe Nimz!
359874,95222,2007-09-24,4,"I read most of the feedback (yes, all 269 ratings) and doubled the sauce, marinated the chops, and cooked it on the stovetop.  The flavor was great, would go well with Asian food, but the sauce leftover was all wasted. It didn't taste good on rice and didn't thicken up at all.  I will probably make again but use a different sauce for the side dish."
285039,283501,2009-11-18,0,"This was a quick and tasty meal.  I made them with grilled steak, mushroom, green pepper and onion.  Topped with provolone on my panini maker.  Delish!"
227978,284347,2013-10-08,5,"Very tasty JackieOhNo!, and it&#039;s such an easy way to prepare an omelet without having to watch over a skillet the entire time.  I halved the recipe and I used fresh onion, but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written, and it was a great way to start off our day.  Made for Football Pool 2013."
1644408,271367,2010-07-01,0,"Awesome recipe !!! I've tried it several times, varying ingredients each time and it's always a hit at my house. Thanks so much for sharing."
362184,361040,2009-08-26,5,This is very tasty and easy to make.  Great way to get in some oats! Served along side the TGIFriday's Black Bean Soup recipe found on this site and will have leftovers toasted in the morning.  Thanks so much for sharing this!
146552,244313,2008-07-29,4,"This was a tastey way of using up zucchini.  I did do some subs but feel that these subs did not alter the taste, but then again maybe they did.  I did not have any ricotta and subbed in some cottage cheese and left out the speghetti sauce, none to be had.  I also fixed them slightly different and had great success.  I did not precook the zuchs, i just cut them in half and using a small spoon scraped and twisted out the seeds and middle to make a ""boat"".  I then added the scraped out middle to the recipe after i chopped it roughly.  Since the recipe did not call for the scrape out in the ingredients i added some additional cracker crumbs to absorb the moisture.  I filled the ""boats"" and put them in a sprayed pan and poured in a tab of water to help cook my raw squash.  I added the parmesean to the filling, covered and baked about 30 mins. Then uncovered and spread with cheddar cheese and finished baking until golden.  YUMMY.  I will fix this again and I will also fix it again using the speghetti sauce when i have it.  Thank you chef CookingSandefer for posting a recipe that is very usable for the weed known as zucchini.  Shirl"
60144,71109,2004-07-01,5,"This has got to be the most best cobbler I have ever tasted, the recipe was so easy and the end results were superb, everyone just raved about the great taste and flavor.
Am off to make another one.
Thank you so much."
53959,254684,2007-09-25,5,This was easy to make and a made a very tasty lunch. The only thing different I did was to use the small pizza crusts as I can only eat 1 piece before I get full. The other 3 pieces I wrapped up and will eat as snacks. Yummm!
789586,22782,2010-08-19,5,Excellent.  Used 1 cup of water and 2 lbs. italian sausage and it turned out great.  We ended up freezing some for a night that we need a quick dinner.  Thanks for posting.
28177,468464,2011-12-03,4,"With a consistency more like a stew than soup, this recipe was pure comfort food.  My mom is in town for a family funeral, and we enjoyed testing a few contest recipes together. The fresh thyme and basil were a great addition, and it gave us a chance to try out the new herb chopper my mom brought down for me.  :)  Chock full of veggies and meat, this hearty stew was a nice ending to a cold winter day.  Made and enjoyed for the Fall 2011 Category Craze-E Contest."
582239,41264,2010-01-30,4,We really loved these!!! Great dough to work with! Added maple extract to icing and it was fabulous!!! I baked half & fryed half and we deffietley liked the fryed bars better! Thanks for posting!
542159,458205,2011-07-11,5,Wonderful flavored spread! The jalapeno honey combo with a hint of lime was very nice on our fresh sweet corn. Made as written but think next time will add just a little bite more lime. Thanks for the post.
50969,319853,2011-12-20,5,"Before getting on with my review I want to say, "" I'm very pleased to be the first one to rate this recipe. :) I needed a pie crust to go with Recipe#197638 and decided to try this one.And I'm so glad I did. All the other pie crusts that I've ever tried has never worked for me,but this one is a winner.I still need to get the hang of rolling the dough out to an even thickness. And as for being able to get the rolled out dough into the pie plate without it falling apart was a breeze, I just folded in half then just placed it in the plate and pressed into the pan. As for crimping the edges,well that's going to take some practice. I have more thing to say, "" If I can make a pie crust with this recipe anyone can. "" Keep Smiling :) """
51510,18834,2003-06-25,3,My husband made this one! The onions & potatoes were excellent! For some reason the meat did not seem tender enough.
37317,9004,2002-04-07,5,"My family really enjoyed this fish.  It was easy to make, made it exactly as the recipe calls.  My family wants me to make it again real soon.  It was great.   Thanks.  Gloria   (gigi)"
384041,29922,2007-02-01,5,"Absolutely delicious!

I had to make some adaptations according to what I had on hand -- having chuck stew beef rather than round, being out of worchestershire and paprika, and leaving out the cornstarch because the adults are low-carbers -- but the essential Rosemary/Tomato/Beef flavor remains.

I would never had thought of putting tomatoes, rosemary, beef,a and soy sauce together but I'll be doing it again because there are no leftovers and the kids are hunting up bread to sop up the juice."
27395,4400,2002-04-16,5,"This is a wonderful appetizer!! I served with ""Wheat Thins"" crackers, and everyone loved it! I used a store brand of cocktail sauce, and used just enough to make a thin layer over the cream cheese (about 3/4 of the bottle). DEFINITE keeper! Thanks:)
~Manda"
201581,97590,2005-10-10,5,"This is the best chicken dumpling soup I've ever made. Since we prefer white meat I used 1 lb chicken breasts and 2 lbs wings. The wings did not go back in the soup, but in the oven to brown and snack on later. I don't like mushrooms, so I used 2 cans cream of chicken. The dumplings were light and fluffy and there were plenty to go around. The leftovers were reheated and tasted even better the next day. If I could give 10 stars I would."
1294167,34797,2009-09-05,5,"Ok, 5 for taste....3 for appearance! These look pretty weird...not very beautiful...but taste is all that matters with me. When I first read the directions I thought you meant ""stir in the eggs"". Come on it was a weekday after all honors classes. I had to throw the flour/egg mixture away sadly enough. I couldn't tell when they were done so I left them in a little longer, which was a bad idea. I only tried that for a few of them though. 25 minutes is perfect time. My family wouldn't stop eating them (which was annoying since I wanted to take them for my lunches)"
674022,14701,2011-12-25,5,"Very nice potato dish. I needed a stove top recipe because my oven was in use and doing double duty already. This was good. I would probably add more cheese next time. The saltiness was balanced with one teaspoon. While some used this for camping, I used it a more formal event and it was well received. Thanks for posting Derf! Enjoy! ChefDLH"
2665960,285936,2013-01-29,3,"I made this with instant brown rice, and it was way too soupy. Didn't know if brown rice absorbs less moisture than white rice. Chicken was also a little bland."
560491,414425,2012-01-27,4,Great tilapia!!  I made the fish as written and didn't make the sauce.  It was light and fresh tasting and the coconut crust made it taste like something you would get at a restaurant.  Made for Best of 2011 Cookbook Tag.
1021845,32204,2009-07-03,5,"Absolutely delicious! For some reason, I don't really like the taste of baking cocoa. I will try this recipe again, altering it to melted bittersweet/unsweetened chocolate instead of the baking cocoa. I'll let you know how that goes! ;) Also, I found that 1 1/2 cups for a double batch was PLENTY enough mix-ins, although this would be to taste. These still deserve a five-star rating without doubt!---------------------------------------
I made these again (and again and again and again), and I think that using the best baking cocoa you can find really makes a difference. I use Ghirardelli, instead of using Hershey, Nestle, or generic cocoa, although more expensive, it's definitely worth it. Also, I halved the vanilla amount and they still taste wonderful."
58104,233175,2008-09-09,5,I steeped 3 ounces of hibiscus in hot water with Recipe #101039. Then added 1/2 to a pitcher filled with ice adding additional cold water. Sorry just getting to the review long overdue. Thanks!!!
657980,119855,2008-08-08,5,This was awesome. great taste and texture. this really helped when I was craving scalloped potatoes! Thank you for a great recipe!
226863,466717,2012-07-14,5,"This pizza tastes amazing and is so little work.  Practically no prep time.....just mincing up the garlic.  I wanted a crispy crust so I baked it without using a pan.  If you do that, I recommend reducing the cook time a bit.  Followed the recipe exactly except I used pecans instead of walnuts.  Enjoyed this one very much!  Thanks for sharing."
47510,106120,2005-07-07,5,This made a lovely dish served along with grilled pork and the flavor was outstanding.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use rum extract.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!
157102,216744,2007-03-14,5,"Yes! This is wonderful stuff, and it is so much better than the over-processed, sugar-laden granola bars or ""fruit"" snacks which line the grocery shelves these days. Raisins and apricots are so sweet that you don't need any added sugar."
194611,23495,2009-02-15,5,Amazing.....i could not find a red zinfandel so i used the red wine we were also drinking along side of the lamb.  My guests said it was  the best lamb they have ever eaten!  A Keeper!  Thanks!
75748,77397,2006-07-13,5,"WOW!!!  Used half all-purpose flour and half best for bread flour and it turned out GREAT!!  Took it to work to rave reviews and a very quickly empty pan!!  Added icing as per suggested, was enough to ice completely.   Was ""better than cinnamon buns, softer and moister,and icing is out of this world!"" was comment from co-workers.  Thanks Kittencal for both wonderful recipes!"

Thanks for a great keeper recipe!
Splenda for the sugar - and left the marinated flank steak in the fridge to rest for 24hours - then cooked it on a hot grill - oh yum!"
455641,291896,2008-07-06,5,I used chicken tenders too and it came out great. This is so simple to throw together and has wonderful flavor. Thanks so much for a yummy recipe! Made this for ZWT4 for the Chic Chefs.
52282,56927,2004-02-17,5,"we really enjoyed this. great cheesecake taste with less cooking time and no need to use a springform pan. i chilled this overnight and it sliced up perfectly. definite keeper, thanks bev."
67026,303131,2011-07-04,4,"These beans were super dooper tasty! I'm not sure about the recommended cook time, however.  In my crockpot, the beans were beginning to burn at 10 hours (on low) - I can't imagine cooking them for the full 24 hours.  I'd like to try these in the solar oven next time!"
74652,152926,2007-08-18,5,MY family makes these for every Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner.  These had better be on the table or all would be dissapointed.  As my family has grown we no have to make 2 dishes of this to accomodate everyone.  the ONLY thing we do different is add a couple of dashes of hot sauce. A true Southern sidedish!  Thanks for sharing!
114522,32614,2004-02-14,3,These were very easy to make but the flavor was disappointing.  They taste vegetable oil. Maybe if we could use butter or margarine instead it would be better.
457907,51161,2008-05-06,5,It was so easy and fast.  We love how the top is a little crispy.  I baked it the full 50 minutes and it turned out really moist.  This was great.  Thanks!
189616,111360,2005-05-03,1,"Jeez, I hate giving bad ratings, with 2 DS's, my DH and myself none of us liked it, many different reasons, my reason--very greasy,lacked spices(perhaps needed chili powder and cumin) and disliked when eating it the batter popped of like in a honeycomb fashion. My DH and DS's simply disliked it due to the grease,lacking flavor and the corn kernels popped upon cooking, and yet I didn't think 325' was hot enough enough to brown only to absorb oil, I ended up raising temp. to 350' with better results, but the end product was very dissapointing to us. But than we all have different tastes, thank anyway Kaceys Momma.........."
573325,459470,2011-11-10,5,"This recipe truly is excellent! It comes together quite quickly and is sooo tasty! The cheesy sauce is creamy and delish and the crunchy topping adds a super nice touch. I dont usually like breadcrumb toppings, but this one really was great! <br/>I used tortellini filled with ricotta and tomato as that's all I could get and since I like my sauce a tad spicier I added in some chilli powder, cayenne pepper, rosemary and black pepper. The nutmeg worked really well with those.<br/>After 15 minutes I had to cover my casserole dish to prevent overbrowning, but that might well have been due to my oven being on the hotter side. <br/>What you see in the pic is half the recipe which served my sis and me perfectly.<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for the post, hon, Ill make this again for sure!<br/>Made and reviewed for PRMR Tag November 2011."
465056,410837,2011-07-28,5,Hubby loved it.  Kids didnt.  I used chunky peanut butter because I was out of creamy.  Yumm!
2001919597,464343,2018-01-08,4,I would have given this 5 stars hands down but when I flipped the pan the whole cake fell apart. It was DELICIOUS. Just don't get an A for presentation. Could you share what pan you used? Is it better to use a spring form pan? What size pan do you use? I also used regular flour vs. cake flour. Really appreciate this recipe. Had a ton of Carambola fruit and it was efficient way to use them!!
330545,12181,2009-04-12,4,I learned to make this in home ec too back in 1958 only then we served on toast.  The English Muffins were different but a very good alternative.  Made for the Easter Egg Hunt 2009.
58104,178494,2006-08-10,5,Very good! In placve of the red and green pepper I used a yellow pepper. I skipped the salt just because I try to keep my salt intake low and with can beans It`s getting up there. I used 1/2 tablespoon cumin and long grain brown rice. This makes great wraps if you have leftovers for a nice lunch which I added salsa and don`t forget the cheese whch helps keep it all together.
169430,508778,2014-04-16,5,This was a real treat. I used it with flat bread crackers and enjoyed every bite. Had to skip the pomegranate bits as that just aren&#039;t available where I live. I think that it would be great as part of a sandwich as well.
81161,42847,2003-04-07,5,"I've always love to eat Vietnamese Yogurt and I am picky about the taste of certain Yogurt.  I am very satified of how this recipe came out. 

This recipe is not difficult to make. You can also freeze the yogurt and eat it.  "
35701,38365,2003-07-22,5,"Wow, are these delicious!  Very easy to prepare, but it seems like you spent much more time on them.  The crust is divine.  Golden on the bottom, flaky, tasting of shortbread.  The topping is light, and really lets the berries stand on their own.  MAKE SURE you add the almond or vanilla extract in step #4, it's left out of the instructions.  Mine took exactly 45 minutes.  When they're cooled slightly, the crust is very flaky, and tends to crumble, separating from the top.  Still delicious, but a bit messy.  Mine came out of the oven around 5:00.  It's now 9:30..I just had one and it held together perfectly.  So just be sure to give them extra time to set up.  But I bet you'll be eating them anyway.  Great recipe!"
305531,56682,2006-07-15,5,This is so good!  It is especially good with Thai food.
71324,58801,2004-11-08,5,These were good! Nice combination of flavours. I put all ingredients in a bag and shook it until the potatoes were evenly coated. That way there was no cleaning up! I also cut the oil down to only 1 tbsp and placed them on baking paper to stop them from sticking. It worked great!
665370,277800,2008-04-28,3,I'm a true lover of vinaigrettes.  I do love the tanginess of them.  But this one is just a tad bit sour even with the honey. Also needs to be thicker to adhere to lettuce leaves.  Maybe a bit more honey and a little more tomato would make the difference.  I'll try it again but will definately be tweaking it.  Made for PAC Spring 2008.
2001384922,138760,2017-02-09,0,"After visiting England, Scotland and Ireland (due to my job) many, many times for over 40 years and having the most wonderful Cream Teas, I couldn't bear to eat what we in America call a scone. Hardly a resemblance!! Thanks for this recipe. I made these scones today and thoroughly enjoyed them with my clotted cream and jam. It was almost like being back in Devon on the Cornish Coast. Will definitely make this recipe again!"
1802899759,69173,2014-07-07,5,"I made this a couple of times before by popping these in the oven. My husband loved them and rated them 10/10. I thought they were good (I&#039;m not a meatball and spaghetti kind of girl) and my 5 year old son wouldn&#039;t touch them after tasting (he is super picky). Tonight for the first time I did the simmer method and can I just say, my mind = BLOWN! They tasted incredible. Husband rated it 20/10 (a ten was not adequate), I rate it a 20/10 (a ten really is not adequate as it is too good) and my picky 5 year old? Well he scarfed them up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few notes/tips: I used grass-fed ground beef, Rao&#039;s marinara sauce and heavy cream in the place of milk for the meatball mixture. The recipe was followed verbatim other than the cream-for-milk substitute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tl;dr Please do the simmer method instead of the oven moethod. Oven tastes great but simmering them = out of this world! Did I mention I&#039;m not a meatball fan but I LOVED these?"
60928,37598,2003-07-09,5,"I made this last week-end for the 4th. We thought it was wonderful. Summer vegetables  were crisp-tender and delicious. The dressing had a  fresh, tangy, dynamic flavor. Just a good all-around salad. Thanks Nurse Di."
2000149918,371459,2015-04-18,5,These are fantastic! We add leftover ham to them and once it finishes cooking we add cheese on top. It is SO good!
410987,10794,2009-09-14,5,this recipe was amazing!! this is the first time i personally made these and they turned out perfect!! i used crunchy pb for the extra peanuty taste...all i have to say is yummy!!!
306469,107312,2011-08-18,3,"Pretty good, almost tastes like a teriyaki sauce. I didn't like that the fish sauce was very strong and there was a slight aftertaste. I found that there was too much liquid too, and I removed the chicken and reduced the sauce and added cornstarch to thicken it.  I think I should have let the sauce reduce all the way down to a glaze and it would have tasted better."
324390,174219,2006-11-12,5,This tastes like a tropical smoothie!You really taste the coconut! I used frozen strawberries and banana slices which helped to make it extra thick! I'll be making this one again!
439066,83789,2009-06-22,5,Delicious! I used more of a 1-to-1 ration of rhubarb to strawberries (just what I had enough of). Also used a little less butter because we ran out! And added ~1/4 cup of dry oatmeal to the topping. Came out great!
231056,18840,2005-07-24,0,This is the best salad dressing I ever made following a recipe.  I highly recomended.  It easy!
2002124220,88276,2018-08-10,5,Loved it! And so easy!!!
294953,42712,2006-12-21,5,"Made this last night with Alaskan Pollock.  It tasted better than I thought.  DW and I compared it to Long John's fish batter.  It was messy but well worth it.  I am keeping this one for when we go camping this summer in case anyone catches anything.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.  Oh yea, tried it with onions... ooo that was good to, DW made sure there were none of those left."
632026,36752,2007-12-27,3,"These smelled wonderfull when I was prepping them I couldn't wait. I like all of the ingredients but when I tried one I had to force myself to finish it. DH said it was ok so maybe it's just not my taste. I will still serve these on Christmas, I am making them ahead and freezin them. 

I wanted to edit my review to add that I served these on Christmas and 9/12 people loved them."
199848,369784,2009-06-12,5,"Light yet filling and easy to make!  I used white onion instead of red and cut the oil in half, but made no other changes.  This is a nice side dish or just by itself.  Thanx for sharing!"
2001995638,105202,2018-02-17,5,"Turned out pretty good! Added some purple onion, a little garlic. Hate I didn't have any celery, green bell peppers or eggs. I know next time ;-)"
56919,114142,2005-03-27,5,"I've already reviewed this sauce as part of another recipe so I'm gonna be lazy and copy and paste:  OMG this sauce. I swear it tastes of guacamole without any avocado in it -- it is amazing that way. I found myself using the leftover sauce in various ways and it worked every single time and I've simply become a slave to the perfection that is this sauce. For example, I would tie my grandma's shoelaces together when she wasn't looking if it would help me get to the sauce before her -- I'm evil that way ;). "
515964,114298,2007-06-24,5,These were great cookies soft and moist. I thought the glaze was better with 1 extra cup of powdered sugar like the original recipe calls for.
126440,21033,2009-10-24,5,Great dip.  Was well received at Bunko last night.   Served with apples and elephant ears.
1441239,366422,2011-12-24,5,"Wow! This is so good! I found this searching for a non-dairy whipped cream option for a flourless chocolate cake I made.  I recently discovered major gluten and dairy allergies and have been trying out desert options for the holidays. I was making it early so though I used the psyllium husks I just refrigerated it overnight since I had the time.  I also used 2 Tbsp Coconut creamer because I only had a cup of coconut milk.  But YUM! Can't believe how good this tastes! Not sure the texture is exactly like a whipped cream~ more of an icing at this point, though it's still chilled in the fridge.  But that serves my purposes just fine and I can't wait to share it with the family for Christmas.  Thanks for the recipe!"
58619,15411,2002-12-01,4,"These were really quick & easy...not to mention yummy!!  
I used creamy peanut butter...next time I will try chunky for a little more peanutty taste."
189616,16287,2005-05-09,5,"Yum-Yum.--though Oops I forgot to add the mustard, distracted because my dishwasher broke down! After it was all cooked I did add the 1 Tbsp mustard  to the juices-(of course I removed the food)and cooked the broth on high-did add flour to make more of a gravy. This was so good!!
Thanks alot Mirj!!!!!!!"
199848,152107,2006-04-04,5,"Giddyup!  These are great mashed tators!  The jalapeno really doesn't make it too hot....my kids could handle it just fine.  I added a little milk to moisten them a bit more.  The whole family enjoyed the ""orange mashed potatoes with corn"".  Thanx for sharing this one; I'll make it again."
529278,109140,2012-05-27,3,"It's been years since I've had Amish Friendship bread, but I used to love it.  This isn't quite the same, so I was a bit disappointed.  However, I really liked how it didn't use a starter.  Leaving the bag of milk on the counter for days really grosses me out!  The kids all really liked this and thought the name was fun.  It was also nice to have a muffin without anything in it, making it better for my little one.  I only had a small box of pudding, but I bought a big box already to try it one more time with the full pudding amount."
1059677,118258,2011-01-02,5,"Perfect. I used 4 1/2 lbs. of chicken thighs and legs, bone and skin on. I ended up with about 7 quarts of broth. I'll never buy canned again."
257154,67256,2010-05-11,5,"Delicious cake and a hit with all! The first time I made it, I forgot about the freezer part, but it turned out great! For comparison, I did the freezer step the second time and I didn't really notice a significant difference (except that it takes longer until it can be enjoyed!). I'll probably skip that step in the future - I like the cake on the warm side anyway. Oh, and time - mine took about an hour and 20 minutes."
222055,178877,2006-08-19,5,"Absolutely the best stuff in the world! I have had it now for two mornings. I had it without the nutmeg because I was out of it. It was still great. This morning I was rushed and couldn't get to the store for nutmeg, so I had it with apple pie spice. It was great! I will definetly be using this recipe FOREVER and will definetly have it with nutmeg soon! I LOVE IT! I love It! I LOVE IT!!!"
21694,4096,2001-10-22,5,I loved these.
2859463,248423,2013-06-11,2,"I should have listened to the other one star review. This doesn&#039;t really taste like the real thing. You know how cottage cheese has this sour taste to it? That&#039;s what this cake tasted like so I would strongly suggest to make it sweeter by adding more sugar (1/2 cup) or fruits to the cake. If you don&#039;t do this it tastes like you&#039;re eating sour cottage cheese that has hardened. The only thing that saved my unsweetened cake was my crust (1.5 graham crackers, 1/3 butter, 1/4 sugar) everything subbed with low fat/cal options. Don&#039;t get me wrong the cake came out well and is a great start but for me it was baked sour cheese that could use some room for improvement."
305916,74301,2006-10-10,5,My whole family LOVED these and that is saying A LOT!!!! I used ground turkey as I usually do in recipes. I also didn't have a mini muffin tin so I used a regular one with great results. Thanks so much for the recipe! It is a keeper FOR SURE!
844554,412357,2012-10-11,5,This is a very good seasoning. I cut it way down for 1 big pork chop and used the brown sugar and the garlic powder and black pepper. Delicious! Made for Think Pink Game 2012.
199020,228111,2011-12-05,5,"Very good fudge. I liked the soft, creamy texture, which is why I picked a Mackinac Island recipe. I made peanut butter this time because it's my husband's favorite, but I look forward to trying the chocolate next time! It couldn't eat more than a small piece, but peanut butter isn't my thing. He ate the entire pan in 2 days, so I figure that's indicative of a 5-star rating! Thanks!"
2123645,14927,2014-09-15,4,Great recipe! I used my own homemade cream of chicken soup and replaced the chicken broth with dry sherry (yum!). I saved half of the sauce to pour over the pork chops. The chops came out so tender!
72570,284,2003-05-21,5,"I loved this! I do something similar with my bananas. I fry them in butter as you do here, and then I eat them with nutella... pure bliss!"
369715,14259,2011-01-29,4,"Good and easy to make. I followed the recipe other then I used canned diced potatoes, and a can of carrots, green beans and two cans of corn. I also used beef broth instead of water. We all enjoyed this."
297232,84035,2006-03-27,5,"Not too difficult to make and the most amazing lemony flavour - I loved this... Oh, to have been a child in Australia! I made it for a family gathering (of my other half's family - talk about a baptism of fire!) and it went down a treat. Thank you!"
2001541241,129926,2018-08-21,4,Everyone really liked it.
2001572356,140839,2017-06-06,5,"The quickest, easiest recipe, has become my go-to recipe for meatballs. Have even used it for meatball subs instead of with spaghetti!"
50509,203039,2009-06-28,4,"Nice way to use up leftover rice and chicken. I made this pretty much in the middle of the night as I had missed dinner, and I think next time I would add some chopped fresh herbs and perhaps use a red bell pepper instead of the chili pepper."
85873,73240,2004-02-11,5,I really liked this & will be making it again. Loved the rub & I marinated 12hr. Size of roast 2 3/4 lb. cooked 450 degrees 20 min. then turned down to 300 degrees for 30 min. a pound. Family likes beef medium rare. Thanks Heather
197023,312834,2009-04-11,5,"Loved everything about this cake: the richness of the chocolate flavour (and yes, I did use 70% cocoa solid chocolate: what else?), the moistness of the cake, the orange flavour and the yummy fudge coating to die for. A veritable Easter treat! :)  And great to have on hand at a time when friends and neighbours were dropping in with Easter eggs!  Everyone who's tried some has loved this cake and been sent home with a slice in a doggy bag! And the promise of a copy of the recipe! :) Thank you, Noo, for sharing yet another scrumptious recipe, and for providing such wonderfully clear instructions! Made for PRMR."
492730,118409,2009-05-30,5,This was Delicious!! My mom maade it for me after lunch.
11009,19177,2003-03-19,5,This is a tasty recipe. The coconut milk and curry take the ho hum out of crock pot chicken recipes. This one is in my save file.
97950,146022,2009-12-27,5,"doubled the recipe cause we had friends over....not sure if they got to taste it as my 17 year old daughter made this her main dish and about  cleaned out the crockpot!  Easy and was not too expensive to  make as everything was on sale (kielbasa and store brand preserves).  We will be making this again, thanks for sharing your recipe!"
169430,55564,2007-12-24,5,I made Recipe #261233 using this for the biscuit layer. I made this as directed but omitted the sugar (I can always add it if I want a sweet biscuit). It baked up wonderfully light and fluffy on the pot pie mixture. I made it up using skim milk and egg white. Thanks for a healthy recipe that works beautifully.
2000441969,393765,2015-08-30,5,I agree this needs anchovy paste that is the only change I made
326787,156275,2011-07-29,5,"I love chicken salad of any kind, unsweet or sweet, I love it. And this summer is so extremely hot I wanted something that sounded cooler than a hot meal. This chicken salad has been in my want to try file for a couple of years...... finally made it and it is very, very good. No dill, so not sure how that would change it. I do wish I had made it early enough to chill it because I think it should be served chilled. I served as sandwiches."
1403386,325679,2009-10-04,5,Huge hit with the whole family!!
247241,48946,2006-12-05,4,"Finally, A decent peanut butter cookie...thank you!!"
839492,295380,2014-09-28,5,"These were so easy. I reduced  the sugar in the filling &amp; just shook a generous amount of cinnamon without measuring. I used less than a third of a cup of powered sugar &amp; a few drops of 1/2 &amp; 1/2, vanilla extract &amp; a little dash of cinnamon in the glaze, perfect , otherwise it would&#039;ve been too sweet. Thanks for sharing!"
33588,11914,2005-02-16,5,"Tasted great,we loved them!Will make often.Thanks Linda"
71565,26428,2003-05-13,5,This taste yummy!  I browned the chopped turkey sausage with one of the tablespoons of olive oil and I added mustard pepper seasoning.  I had only the red kidney beans not the white and it was still delicious.  I added 1 pkg. of splenda in the dressing and it is wonderful!  I may have gone a little heavy on the parsley to suit my taste.  I will make this many times this summer and it will be a GREAT camping dish!
280271,414028,2012-03-19,5,This is so easy to whip up and I had all the spices handy...I know it's for ribs...but I rubbed it on my chicken tenderloin and threw it on my George Foreman grill and whoola...I had a spicy tasty lunch...I love the smoking taste of the paprika...perfect amount of all the spices...the only thing I changed was to replace the sugar with splenda...Thanks for posting it...made for Spring 2012 PAC
1141691,354237,2009-02-17,5,"Finally got to make these today after a long anticipation and they are wonderful- soft,sweet and delicious.I didn't have fast rising yeast on hand,so I used regular active dry yeast and I increased the amount by 1/2 a teaspoon.I let it proof in warm water for a few minutes and then proceeded with the rest of the steps.These are just perfect and it's definitely a recipe that I will treasure.I would really recommend it to anyone and thank you for posting Donna65 :)"
86318,56155,2014-01-12,5,"This turned out utterly delicious the second time around. Part of the trouble was that though I&#039;m used to baking bread, I tend to approach it from the point of using a fixed amount of liquid to a variable amount of flour. Here the flour is all mixed up first, then the liquid is added. I was afraid to add too much more liquid, so I got overly dense bread that didn&#039;t rise (only one loaf, I froze the rest of the dough for reworking later). I suppose if I had increased the liquid considerably, it would have worked, but I didn&#039;t want to stray too far from the recipe. This time, I rearranged the recipe to be easy for me, with liquid, yeast, sugar, other ingredients, then part of the flour. I think my cornmeal and brown rice were dry, and needed more water. This time, because I added the liquid first, I ended up using only 5 1/3 cups of white flour. I didn&#039;t glaze the loaves or bother with seeds. I got 2 loaves of 700 grams each and one small loaf of 315 grams. But what beautiful bread this is - soft and tender. I&#039;m very happy with it and will use this recipe again. I also increased the salt by 1 teaspoon, though with the reduced flour, I don&#039;t think it was necessary. Oh, and used oat, rather than wheat, bran. Thank you for posting this recipe."
904480,135040,2008-07-29,5,"This jam is so excellent. I had some Coco Lopez in the fridge, so when I saw this recipe I thought, ""Oh that sounds good and I have most of the ingredients."" Well, I am so happy with this! I like that it is different, and it really does taste exactly like a Pina Colada. I will make it again soon so I can give it as gifts and have enough for myself."
350938,12650,2010-08-24,5,"This is amazingly close to the store bought A1 sauce, so close I can't tell the difference. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
648514,65119,2008-07-09,5,"I'd give you more stars if I could!  Our 2 year old (and one year old) can't have any milk products.  I was hard pressed to find a dairy free ranch in stores because lots of moms use ranch to ""bribe"" kids into eating raw veggies.  Well, I have a ranch fan on my hands now!  And a carrot fan, bell pepper fan, etc.  Thank you so much for this easy and YUMMY recipe!"
2671889,341708,2013-02-02,0,I made this cake and it was AMAZING!! I used this icing for mine!!  Tasted amazing!!<br/><br/>http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chocolate-Icing/Detail.aspx
305531,250232,2013-09-15,5,"Yummers! I love everything Cajun-style.  I made these as directed as a side to a sandwich. So simple and so good. Thanks, Paula for sharing. Made for Zaar Stars Tag."
2904249,385818,2013-07-18,5,"This recipe was great! Had to leave the celery out because I am allergic to the stuff. I recommend using corn oil for the vegetable oil ( I am allergic to soy as well so soybean oil is contraband in my household). Corn oil seems to add flavor, to me anyways."
133174,282927,2008-02-22,2,"This intrigued me and sounded like something we would enjoy. It was easy to put together; however, seemed to be lacking in flavor. It was served on a bed of rice and suggested and a salsa was added for extra heat and flavor. Good luck in the RSC #11."
86318,92350,2006-10-24,5,"This sweet bread is fantastic! It went too quickly to get a picture this time around, but there will be other times. I divided the recipe in half because I have a small oven. The dough of half of the recipe came to 1130 grams. I halved that again, rolled each half into a 16 x 9-inch rectangle, spread them with the filling, rolled them up and placed them in 9-inch round cake pans, curving from the middle. The bread rose beautifully and was so soft. Oh, I have to admit - I used all ingredients, but I substituted dried cherries for the raisins or dates, and also used only about 2 tablespoons melted butter in the filling for the halved recipe. I'm looking forward to trying this again with the raisins called for, as well as trying other nuts and dried fruit combinations. Thank you so much for posting this recipe. It's a jewel. "
527607,187793,2015-09-04,5,"These were delicious,nice heat and enjoyed by all"
58319,34688,2002-10-21,5,"Great!  I used less potatoes(don't like to peel) and also used 1 cup chicken broth instead of water.  I didn't add the cheese because my husband comes home late, so instead I spooned out the portions into bowls and added cheese then threw them in the microwave for 30 seconds when we were ready to eat. I even liked this recipe and I'm not a big fan of kielbasa."
58439,378880,2009-07-14,5,"Who would think could improve on simple BLT?
Well, this is a TERRIFIC recipe!
Subtle, not overpowering is Blue Cheese!
Would definately recommend for its simplicity and it did please!
THANKS!"
743211,38552,2008-02-20,5,This was so good. Not at all weird like I feard it would be. A coworker gave me a bunch of lemons so we had to do something with them. We made this and brought it to a family dinner. Even the food snobs were impressed. It does fall a lot so a spatula/knife should be ran around the edge of your pan once you take it out of the oven. Thanks.
1058097,196585,2011-08-04,4,"These are pretty good, but I thought the mustard tended to overcome the curry flavor.  The filling was also a little dry with the listed amount of mayo.  The combination of flavors is good, though, and I would make these again with a little adjustment in the seasoning.  Thanks for posting!"
1269948,318668,2011-02-03,5,"Very, very good!  I have made lots of different Queso dips and I really liked this one a lot.  I roasted the poblano peppers in the oven and then skinned them.  Throw those and the tomatoes in a food processor.  I do not ever use American cheese, so I just doubled the colby/monterey jack.  Great!"
531799,36102,2008-02-10,4,I was looking for a recipe that used buttermilk when I came across this.  My husband wasn't too happy when I told him I was fixing french toast but he immediately changed his mind when he ate it.  We both enjoyed it and the flavor is so much better than the plain kind.  So we have a new addition to our breakfast favorites with thanks to you.
128473,244242,2007-10-17,5,"Wow, wow, wow...this was so good. No one could tell it was from a box...the flavour, the texture, the taste and it looks so pretty.
We really enjoyed this dessert. The sour cream and cool whip add a new dimension to this lovey chocolatey cherry treat. I will be making this again and again, thanks so much for sharing."
242779,151328,2006-03-19,4,"I tweaked this recipe just a bit and used 1/2 whole and 1/2 skim milk and added mashed bananas and dried blueberries.  The consistency was more of a ""griddle"" cake for me, than a ""pancake"", but this recipe was excellent otherwise!  Thanks for sharing!"
558429,55110,2013-06-28,5,"These came out great. I used whole wheat flour, added 1/4 cup ground flaxseed and chia seed, used 4 bananas, decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup and added 1 tsp. ground ginger and cinnamon. I was able to fill 6 of my Texas-sized muffin cups. The muffins were moist and delicious and this recipe will be added to my permanent collection. Thanks for posting, Dancer!"
782050,60949,2008-08-27,2,"It's not that I hate this recipe; I think it's terrific with some serious adjustments...a LOT more scallion, a LOT less cayenne, a LOT more lemon, and skip the crab in favor of chunk white tuna (just because crab is too expensive to hide in this creamy rich sauce.) I would also use a different pasta; I don't think the shells are a good fit."
155804,29108,2004-11-19,0,"I was going to post this recipe, but then I checked to see if anyone else already did.  I got this recipe from my mother.  About 10 years ago, the paper  did catch fire and I stupidly opened up the oven and turned on my ceiling fan and had little bits of flying fire all over.  It's funny now.  Since then I use the oven bags and it comes out just as good.  According to my family it is the best apple pie there is!"
1377407,158548,2013-01-03,5,Bland is certainly not a word I would use to describe this soup. SO good!
80998,289730,2008-11-06,4,"Simple, cheap , and tasty...just the way I like it.  Everyone enjoyed this greatly.  This is a recipe that is great as is, but could be played with.  A vegetable might be a good addition for a one dish meal.  I added some shredded cheddar on top.  Thanks.  Made for my 3 chefs fall 2008."
2488743,26849,2012-11-08,0,"By far the best choc. Chip cookies I've ever had! Every one in my family would agree on that! Made for the first time Sunday, and fixing to make batch #2 now!"
1324122,80435,2010-01-20,0,I'm not going to rate this since I didn't try your recipe but wanted to pass on a hint to those who use the no boil noodles.  The noodle are a great invention but I suggest using more sauce than you usually would in your traditional recipies and consider cooking your lasagna covered for at least half of your cooking time.  The extra moisture will reduce the chewiness that can result by using the no boil noodles.  Definitly a lot quicker than making the traditional way.
197023,142575,2006-01-07,5,"An easy to make, flavoursome and moist stuffing.  I made this and Ritaâs Chestnut and Cranberry Stuffing Recipe #145340 in casserole dishes.  Both are equally delicious warm or at room temperature.  We initially ate them warm, and there was considerable debate â among eight of us â as to which was the preferred stuffing.  Most ended up sitting on the fence and saying that they loved both equally, so it looks as if Iâll be making both whenever I make one of them!  I made this stuffing exactly to the recipe, except for adding four cloves of minced garlic, and marjoram instead of parsley which Iâd run out of.  For the stock, I used a chicken stock variation of my Vegetable Stock Recipe #135453, which I shall be posting shortly.  Thanks, Rita, for another fabulous recipe which I shall be making again."
55927,15454,2002-10-12,3,"Just got done making and eating this with my three and six year olds. They say 'this is really good mommy'. It was easy, easy to make, and I had everything on hand (that is important to me). I added some fried potatoes that I had in the fridge. I did make one mistake though - I buttered the dish instead of greasing (big mistake - it stuck to the bottom) next time I will use the grease from the sausage to line the dish, and add some chopped onion and bell peppers. It was just right for the kids with ketchup, and I added some Cholula (like Tabasco only better) and ketchup. Good easy dish!"
226863,345508,2012-07-09,5,"These are even better the next day eaten cold!  I know that sounds strange, but its true.  Made these last night to go along with some wonderful steaks, and they tasted okay, but not great.  But today at lunch pulled them out and tossed them onto a salad as a garnish....fantastic! Thanks for sharing!"
55380,28289,2005-09-09,4,"This was a nice enchilada casserole. It was very simple to make (we used a pizza cutter to slice the tortillas) and had a good blend of flavors. We used green enchilada sauce over the top. It did turn out a bit 'runny,' even though we followed the recipe both in ingredient proportions and letting it rest about 15 min...we just scooped it up with tortilla chips, though, no problem. ;o) I think perhaps next time we might try corn tortillas, too, for texture. But overall it was a very nice casserole; thanks for posting!"
470351,162379,2009-12-30,5,Holy cow this was good!!!  I followed this one to the letter and served it with sriracha sauce on top for DH and I (so the kids didn't have to deal with our spice kick!) and we LOVED it!!!!  Will definitely make again!
2832447,113983,2013-06-03,5,"My take, 2cups long grain white, 1 14oz. can fat free chicken broth, saffron, 1T. butter, minced onion and garlic, small can mushroom stems and chunks drained, salt to taste. All in rice cooker and push the button.  Wonderful side, first tried with grilled lamb chops. Lite and fluffy rice the way it&#039;s meant to be. Yum."
2001599081,418319,2018-09-19,5,Excellent. Yummy. How can it get any easier than this.
946146,204468,2009-06-14,5,I loved this!  What a perfect summer treat!  Made with Raspberry Jello and peaches.  Made for ZWT5 Groovy GastroGnomes.
383346,436358,2010-09-13,5,That's a wonderful recipe.  So tasty even though there is no cheese.  We didn't miss the cheese at all.  I used store-bought pesto (olivieri).  I used dried parsley.  Thanks Pink :)  made for Newest Zaar tag
335469,9155,2008-01-15,5,"Great. I am sending these to my husband for his birthday. If cookies were wine I would say this cookie had alot of ""body"". I too used regular egg and found 10 - 12 min does the trick. Thanks for posting."
4470,110241,2005-10-01,5,"Reduced the recipe to one chop - It had a nice tang from the lime juice, remained moist and tender. Cutting back to one chop you need to only cut the lime juice and water in half.  It does reduce nicely giving you a bit of sauce to pour over the chop. Thanks Dug you are right this is an easy and really good recipe"
683666,246594,2010-06-30,5,"I loved this!! I decided to make this about an hour before dinner so I drained/pressed the tofu well but didn't have time to marinate.  So I just threw the tofu on the grill and then used a brush to spread the marinade on every time I flipped the slices.  I used the leftover marinate as a sort of dip when eating. As delicious as it was, I know it'll be even better when it has time to marinate!  Can't wait to make it again!!"
839452,130943,2009-01-17,2,"This was ok for dipping french fries in, but for seafood I would add in some sweet relish."
322326,26888,2007-06-26,4,This was a very simple recipe. we enjoyed this very much. i used just salmon and followed the instructions to a T. this was my first time making sushi and i will definitly use this reciep again but with variations. thanks for posting. MIss PIxie xx x :D
269521,248977,2007-09-05,3,"We had comfort food for dinner last night.   I substitued smoked sausage for the italian sausage and also added raw spinach.   Since there is only two of us I cut the recipe in half.  

It made a creamy sauce, however we felt that the flavor could have used a little more 'edge' to it -- a bit bland.  Next time think I'll cut back on the gouda and add some parmesan or swiss cheese.  Instead of adding  more cheese to the top I sprinkled with italian bread crumbs which helped soak up some of the cheese.  It's a great basic recipe and will definitely make again with a few adjustments."
714956,72653,2011-03-21,5,Made this at Christmas and it got RAVE reviews! Wouldnt change a thing. :)
129201,100777,2005-10-17,5,"Easy, quick and quite low-fat!!!  Served with Hummous #126463 and Baba Ghanoush #67570. Loved the sesame flavour!!"
539686,146014,2012-11-19,5,"This is a really great take on the turkey sandwich. I actually made a loaf of honey wheat bread, Recipe #90151 to serve it on and it was perfect. I am not a sprouts fan so I used baby lettuces and cranberry chutney."
2001708014,2886,2017-09-10,3,"Tasted great. But even though it was on the middle rack, the top started burning, while the inside was still raw. Next time ill make sure to move it, but maybe an extra note on this would be useful."
249867,113143,2008-06-22,5,"This is one of our top 10 favorite pies!
I got this exact recipe from someone else, and I'm glad to see it here so I don't lose it.  
My friends and I find it especially useful for using wild berries we've picked, as it makes them go further.  (It's sad to see hours of picking all go into one pie)
And any kind of berry works with this: blackberries, mulberries, strawberries...
You do have to be careful with the vanilla custard part.  If you try to rush things, you will get lumps."
226867,22958,2009-08-16,5,"This is a great recipe! I did use fresh rosemary and subbed pine nuts for the almonds b/c one of my guests is very allergic to tree nuts. Didn't bother with the sail - didn't have any red peppers!  Will add sail when my granddaughter visits!
Thanks, Uncle Bill!"
2000825300,44278,2016-01-18,1,"I have to say I&#039;m joining the ranks of those who didn&#039;t like this recipe.  I too didn&#039;t believe a roast could cook to tender in an hour.   Sure thing it was not done   I don&#039;t see why this recipe got so many good reviews. Sorry, but this one&#039;s not a keeper"
705251,268273,2009-01-09,5,"Oh boy oh boy what a treat!! I made these for a mid-week breakfast for the kids and it came out perfect! Nice and moist rolls with a great topping. Do want to mention I used a ""vanilla"" pudding instead of butterscotch as a personal preference. We all loved it because it is NOT overly sweet at all! The one little thing I'd mention is to place a small baking tray ""under"" the tube pan as my sauce kinda cooked over and spilled on the bottom of the oven. Not a biggie and may depend on the brand of frozen dinner rolls and how high they raise (mine were over the pan) but just a tip in case yours does the same. Wish I could give you 10 stars for a recipe we'll use often through the year as a breakfast treat! Tagged in 123 Hits.  (*Edited to add - this warms up well the next day in the microwave - we were able to enjoy it a 2nd morning by warming it up for 25 secs - still nice and moist! )"
831580,313578,2010-01-05,4,"This was a decent dish, but nothing spectacular, in my opinion. This marked the first time I'd ever cooked with hominy (I used a can of ""Golden Hominy"" - is there any other type, I wonder?)  I skipped the optional butter (and 1 teaspoon is an unusual amount of butter, too), but otherwise made the recipe exactly as written. I used a medium yellow onion, and cooked everything on medium heat (I think maybe it should've been a little higher, as I didn't quite get the Spam cubes to brown a little). The recipe has no added spices, but the Spam already adds enough. I split the 4 servings across three meals (dinner, lunch and a late breakfast). The taste is pretty good, and the whole recipe is pretty quick and easy, so I'll bump my rating up to 4 stars for that."
2001275073,135095,2017-03-04,3,I make my version of this often it's my go to quick comfort meal that I serve on top of mashed potatoes or white rice. Imagine you're real tired but real hungry and you're looking for something quick and easy but not fast food.
363055,403422,2014-01-27,5,I love these sauces.   I especially enjoy the raspberry chipotle sauce on grilled skinless boneless chicken thighs.
35526,4393,2005-12-29,5,I make this recipe for every party my best friend will be at.  She says mine tastes better than other people's.  I think it's because I use about 5 green onions tather then 3.  We serve with little bread sticks.
582098,9494,2009-01-19,5,My DD and I just made these and they are delicious!! I cant get the kids to stop eating them. Thanks for the great recipe!
2159900,135350,2012-01-24,5,"This recipe was my first attempt at making homemade mac n cheese. I was blown away at not only how easy it was, but how it turned out! Fantastic recipe!"
2177678,222519,2012-02-09,0,"WONDERFUL recipe!  I especially appreciate the fact that you can control spiciness and sodium.  The flavor is delcious.  For more of a creamy casserole effect, I melted 4 oz. of cream cheese into the sauce.  I also agree with other reviews to double the recipe for a 9x13 pan.  I mixed part of this sauce with my shredded chicken to stuff the tortillas and poured the rest over top.  Sprinkle a little cheese on top and you'll have the best homemade enchiladas north of the border!:)"
254805,83506,2006-05-03,5,I loved this! I used about 2lbs of leftover pork loin that I shredded with a fork and baked in the oven at 300* for 2 hours. I decreased the vineger to 2 tbs and used 1/3 cup plus one tbs brown sugar. We like it a little sweet. :-) Thanks for posting!
1801253004,344836,2014-02-13,0,"OMG!!  NEVER NEVER add a warm marinade to cold meat and then refrigerate.  Do you want to die from food poisoning?  ALWAYS use a COOLED marinade on cold chicken.  I'm having trouble believing someone would actually post such directions.  Sorta sorry to be so blunt, but CHEEZ..."
2284691,211314,2013-07-23,5,I reduced the numbers and made a 2 serve. Worked out really well. Also we only had sour cream so used that instead. Lovely. Thankyou.
780172,331445,2013-08-18,4,"These are a nice twist on a tuna patties. Only problem I had was they were mushy when I started cooking them, but did brown up nicely. Made for ZWT9."

601528,378218,2009-11-17,5,Can't really go wrong with these two ingredients :)  Made a nice after work treat.
457113,33919,2008-04-22,5,Very good!  added the rotel & tomatoes & black olives--delicious!  thanks for sharing
547750,77585,2008-03-20,4,"Great soup.  I loved the addition of the spinach.  It made for a nice presentation as well as being ""good for you"". :D I used this recipe in a night class I taught last year and I've only just realised I didn't review it."
160974,137629,2006-04-07,4,"These were a fun addition to the dinner table. Next time I will add a bit of sugar to the dough. Mine were not browning too much, but when I turned the oven up to 375, they started to color. I made your pizza sauce, too, which is easy to whip up. 

Roxygirl"
112864,237519,2011-03-11,5,Very nice.  Omitted the water chestnuts as we had a lot of snow peas.  And added a couple dashes of sriracha sauce to perk it up.  Thanks for sharing.
43846,40224,2003-06-15,5,"A very good marinade.  I used a very small onion, bottled minced garlic, splenda instead of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp of tabasco, and 1 bottle of michelob ultra (the lower cal/low carb beer)!  I grilled mine after about 8 hours marinating.  My husband was upset that I didn't make a bigger batch!  Thank you for this recipe."
68715,21418,2003-04-19,5,"This has such flavour! The lemon extract is a nice addition. However, I had a slight curdling, which may have been my fault, I don't know. To make sure THAT didn't happen again, I first combined the sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Then I stirred in the egg yolks. Next, the juice, extract, and 1/3 cup water. Then 1 cup hot water. Cooked everything and it was beautiful! Will definitely make this again and again!"
369715,396008,2013-09-28,4,My husband made this. He followed the recipe as written and we all enjoyed this. It tasted good heated up too.
696623,181511,2007-12-20,5,"Took this to a breakfast potluck and everyone was so impressed! Not only is it easy to prepare, but it tastes so good and is very visually appealing. I didn't have any whole berries left so I garnished the platter with blackberries. It was an awesome change from standard breakfast fare and was one of the first things to disappear, even though I made a double batch! I think I will also try it with blackberries and blackberry jam over the weekend!"
356515,129059,2008-10-08,5,"Amazing! the flavors are wonderful, we cook this regularly"
383853,132052,2009-03-21,5,"Fantastic way to do omelets!!  My husband loved them.  Perfectly cooked.  I put some chopped mushrooms, bacon, breakfast sausgae, and taco/mexican flavored cheese in ours.  This is definitely the way I will be making omelets from now on."
1290504,203987,2012-12-11,5,I am a huge fan of quick & easy casserole meals on a busy weeknight and this definitely fit all the requirements!  I had all the ingredients on hand (except for the corn) and it turned out great!  Dear BF loved it and said it was very good :)  Definitely will be in my rotation for dinner.  Thank you so very much for posting this delicious recipe!
252727,191797,2010-06-08,5,what's not to like?
52543,146085,2006-03-04,5,"Great dinner rolls - even if its not a special occasion or a holiday! I scaled the recipe in half, included the sour cream & mixed in my Kitchen Aid. We enjoyed then, warm from the oven, with our Baked Spaghetti. Thanx Gerry!"
486888,28025,2009-04-22,4,Made it with a little oatmeal which was already suggested and the patties held up pretty well.  Hubby and I both thought they were super dry and he suggested adding mayo to the batch before making into patties.  The salmon patty recipe we like uses it successfully so we may try it next time on this one.  Thanks!
430455,53914,2009-07-24,5,"This is an excellent recipe! I made the mistake of salting the fish before putting it in the oven: the saltiness of the parmesan in the sauce makes it entirely unnecessary. Still, delicious! My whole family loved it, even the picky eaters."
133174,460305,2011-12-14,5,Your lovely photo got my attention and having just purchased some fresh blackberries I had to make this.  The recipe was reduced to 2 servings and baked in individual ramekins.   I used gluten free ingredients and left out the amaretto.  These were served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.
52543,86698,2010-03-29,5,"Move over McDonalds, there's a new ""special sauce"" in town, slightly sweet, a little bit tangy & quite delish! I'll use Gerry's method when I use pre-made burgers for a large group but I prefer recipe #92021 when its just the 2 of us, topped with the usual condiments & Gerry's sauce. Thanx for sharing!"
110210,110078,2006-09-11,5,"A simple and tasty meal. I added a bit of garlic salt, just for taste and omitted a bit of the water based on other reviews. Next time I might add a bit more chili powder, just for extra kick. Served w/ mashed potatoes per your recommendation. Thanks so much for posting, it was great!!! "
327938,93688,2010-12-30,5,Fantastic! I made these yesterday and my boyfriend just loved them - even asked me to make them again soon. I didn't have any eggs so had to do without (had a hard time getting the flour/coconut mixture to stick) and unfortunately didn't have the ingredients to make the sauce but I can't wait to try that next time. They reminded me of the coconut shrimp we had on our first date. Thanks for sharing this recipe!
79877,335581,2009-03-26,0,"Delicious sauce.  I adjusted the taste a bit using my stove top smoker.  I smoked my peppers, onions and garlic recipe#293602 first.  It gave the sauce even more layers.  This sauce would be great on more than steak.  Will definitely make again.  Tried to adopt for PAC Spring 2009, but still very glad I tried it."
626447,243431,2009-07-17,5,We love salmon and this was exactly what I was looking for!  Deelicioussss~
227765,3488,2005-07-08,4,"Great recipe! I don't think I let the potatoes boil long enough, they were a bit ""al dente"". "
49304,182629,2009-12-06,0,"I have been making your recipe for years, kept forgetting to review it. We love how juicy the chicken is & doesn't cook in the fat. Thank you for sharing the recipe."
780028,114397,2009-04-30,4,"If I could give this 4.5 stars I would!  I threw everything into the pot at the same time, like one of the other reviews did.  And since we use regular rice (vs. instant), I added 1.5 cups of uncooked rice into the pot to simmer along with the chicken.  I used PACE salsa and topped with cheddar cheese and shredded lettuce (no lettuce when wrapping to freeze though). The only thing I would do different next time would be to cube the chicken vs. shredding it, I think you would be able to taste it a bit more/better.  Served this inside homemade tortillas, can't wait to freeze them and see how they heat up! **update:wrapped these individually in foil for the freezer and they were perfect!  Just microwave them for about 2.5 minutes, yummy!"
4439,67733,2007-02-22,5,"i can't believe i haven't reviewed this recipe. i have made it exactly as posted and also have doubled it and used a yellow cake mix and a 13 x 9 pan. both ways are luscious, especially since i can now always get plant city strawberries."
1802849661,131076,2015-11-16,5,"Yummy! We had this for Sunday lunch and it went down a storm! It smelt so amazing when cooking, I could not wait to dig in! I threw in some parsnips as well as all the other veg because we love them and all those veggies were just amazing. Soft and sweet. The juices made a killer sauce too!"
236262,277392,2015-03-17,5,"This bread is delicious. I do not have a gluten-free setting on my bread machine, so I used the 2# french bread setting for a dark crust. The time for that was 2&#039;35&quot;. The loaf is beautiful, with a crunchy crust and a light, tender crumb. I loved it.

The only change I made, due to ingredients on hand, was to use 1/4 cup of garfava flour instead of 2T garfava and 2T quinoa. Worked out just fine.

Thank you for sharing. This is a new favorite of mine."
134011,37413,2005-11-26,5,Total comfort food!Served with mashed potato & veg.  My 9 year old gave me no trouble with eating his dinner.  Very simple and very tasty.  Thanks for sharing :)
286566,475304,2013-01-18,5,"Delicious, delicious, deliciou wings such sticky goodness, I scaled back for 2 serves and my six wings without tips weighed in just under 12 ounces and we were wishing there were more.  When I marinated them I thought there was not going to be any sauce left over and I was right but it gave the wings a wonderfull sticky glaze that was finger licking goods but I just knew that sauce would taste so goods so I doubled the sauce ingredients and heated up in the microwave and it was so good over the rice and the wings.  Thank you Nancy's Pantry for a really GREAT recipe, made for Everyday A Holiday."
1058097,116814,2010-05-18,5,"This is an excellent and very easy tuna recipe.  I halved the amount of relish and used Cajun Sunshine pepper sauce.  I definitely recommend using the mustard and hot sauce; they're not assertive in the flavor, but add just that little special something.  Thanks, Kit!  Tagged for Zaar Cookbook Tag."
303414,81902,2009-09-29,5,Absolutely fabulous!!  Will for sure make again for family gatherings!!
269480,291819,2009-03-21,5,"Mmmm so good and so green! Tastes like caramel popcorn- sweet but only green. I agree with the other poster, salted peanuts would also be great with it. Thanks sydsmama! Made for TOTM's Tag It Green."
93446,161530,2006-04-21,5,Great recipe for Friday nights or any night when time is at a premium.  I used whole wheat English muffins for the base but kept the rest of the recipe the same.  We really enjoyed these!
239758,106334,2010-03-15,5,"Ten stars in my book! This produced an absolutely perfect roast chicken for company. My only changes were to use 2 cloves of garlic and 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh basil in place of the dried. Also rubbed some of the seasoning mixture on the outside of the bird as well as putting it under the skin. The chicken was moist and tender, and a big bonus was that the juices made the best gravy I've had in ages. Thank you so very much for posting."
1802652479,514966,2014-04-08,5,"I was looking for a breakfast casserole recipe, and I am glad I chose this one. The proportions of eggs, potatoes, and bacon were just right."
163112,169865,2008-02-11,5,"Perfect.  Excellent flavors, cooked just right, very quick & easy.  And it's all gone.  :)  Made for the Tagine Treasure Hunt.  Thank you!"
599450,168133,2009-06-14,5,"Very rich! Loved it! Made it with boneless skinless breasts because I mis-read the ingredients - my bad! Glad I did, as I don't like to cook with skin on the chicken. This makes an abundant sauce which went quite well on a bed of cooked linguine. Thanks, ~Leslie~! Made for ZWT5, Kitchen Witches."
866747,312945,2009-06-10,0,I was very disappointed. I really had in mind something smooth and cookie doughie but this was nowhere closse to that. The batter had the texture of a very thick cake batter or very thin bread dough. The taste was not good at all. I wasted all of the ingredients. Im sorry: I hate giving bad reviews but it was the truth. :(
75847,28943,2003-11-30,5,"I have always had a problem making pie crust. Not anymore! My DH said this was the best I ever made. Now I won't be so scared of making pies. DH is truly grateful!! He is always saying Pie? What's Pie? LOL
Thanks Karen!"

Thank you, Dana.  Your cookies would be a great addition to Christmas platters!

407338,352567,2009-10-16,5,Wonderful flavor and the honey did the trick!  I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a little less cream than stated.  Easy to prepare and very tasty.  Prepared as a participant in the 8th Edition of Make My Recipe Event October 2009.
2002034771,76230,2018-03-06,5,I use frozen Raspberries instead of Cranberries...it's so good! :)
128473,240242,2017-09-06,5,"Amazing Guacamole Stacy. We enjoyed this tasty treat very much. I've never had it this way before, it was awesome. Deep, dark and delicious. We've only had it made with tomatoes or mayo before, this is a lovely addition to the rotation. Thank you for sharing a recipe, I will make again. Made for CQ4- Central America."
2000276332,406047,2015-07-06,5,Let me say OMG!! These are amazing!  Who would&#039;ve thunk it?  Corn starch to make biscuits???!  Southern girl here and going gluten free was hard but this recipe is going to change my gf life!  No longer will I have to want for a good biscuit!  Thanks for sharing. Btw I used low carb milk with white vinegar and used extra corn starch to lay them out to pat and cut just like I would have for regular biscuits!  My daughters and hubby are very happy!  If you keep folding them and make them kind of thick you will have the usual layers that you would&#039;ve for a regular biscuit!! Thanks again for sharing!
294705,144439,2006-06-09,5,"This was a hit at mt house, easy to put together too!!"
328099,312842,2009-11-14,5,"Tried this as written--WOW!!  Really was authentic, however, I am going to try using Guiness beer in place of the beef broth next time.  We had this several times while in Ireland and it was always made with Guiness.  Thanks for posting."

4470,207533,2010-07-15,5,"This is a really tasty recipe. I used Japanese Eggplant grilled it on my Griddler for apprx. 6 minutes, then painted the top with the great sauce, closed the griddler and let it infuse the flavor.  I made the sauce in the morning and let it meld the flvors together.  Adefinite do again recipe"
163538,82641,2007-09-09,3,This recipe was just ok. I found it a little bland.
131021,28556,2010-03-20,5,"I loved this. I think the dressing was great. I used 2/3 of an English cucumber and didn't have any fresh parsley but I look forward to making it again using some. I have some leftovers that I will have for lunch today, I think I will add some feta cheese like Kelly's Kravings suggested."
284180,367414,2009-10-14,5,Delicious and so easy!  The hardest part was trying not to burn my tongue on the hot caramel as I tried to get a taste while transferring from the bowl to the dish.  Yum!  I used an 11x7 glass dish which worked well.  Then an hour in the fridge and they were done!
142038,27520,2007-12-17,4,"This is a great recipe to have on hand. Easy, quick and of course inexpensive. I have made this a few times and try to keep the ingredients on hand at all times. 
Since it doesn't take a lot of time to make it's great on those busy nights."
319732,45889,2009-03-09,5,"When I made this recipe I was low on limes, so I used 1/2 lime juice and 1/2 lemon juice.  I also added a few pinches of crushed red pepper.  Served it over ziti.  This recipe was very, very delicious, something I'd expect to get at a high-end Italian restaurant, and something I'd be delighted to serve guests because most of the prep work can be done in advance and the actual cooking time is very brief.  Five stars for sure!"
54678,25438,2004-04-06,5,"Well my chili powder must have been extremely hot or I used tbsp instead of tsp because we found the sauce to be very very hot but the guys sure enjoyed it. I doubled the recipe and used larger tortillas so had five of each. One batch made exact to recipe and the 2nd pan had no olives, some sour cream with the cottage cheese cuz I ran short on that ingredient and used a can of green enchilada sauce instead of the red sauce.Would definitely make again."
2837821,85918,2013-05-24,5,I have used this recipe before.  This time I used a 3 lb bag of red skinned potatoes and tripled everything else.  Once for a church potluck I used a 5 lb bag if red skinned potatoes and then&lt;br/&gt;I multiplied the rest of the ingredients by 5.  Everyone loved it and asked for my recipe.  I slice the potatoes very thin and then it does not take near as long to cook about 5 hours on low.
157425,130868,2008-01-27,5,"My dad used to buy us the tv dinners with beans and franks, applesauce, and corn bread when we were younger. It was our favorite Saturday lunch and this brought back great memories. The beans were sweet yet had a bit of tang that was perfect. I used Ball Park franks and turkey bacon, added two cloves of garlic and simmered slowly in my electric frying pan. This will be a family favorite for us, thank you shapeweaver!"
1189919,316304,2009-03-02,0,"Perfect!  So moist -- better than any cornbread I have made with eggs. And, so easy. Thanks!!"
293410,282167,2008-02-22,5,"This was a delicious, simple and really quick oatmeal! Instead of canned oranges, I used a chopped orange (that was for half the recipe) and it was still great!"
200655,141195,2006-01-08,5,I made this one too n it was yummy. I used taco seasoning when I browned my burger.  also added black olives n a plop of sour cream on mine.  the catalina dressing is what does it!!Thanx for posting lvs2cook!!
115758,97445,2005-10-18,5,"Mmmm!! What a lovely spring/summer pasta dish.
Use good quality fresh ingredients and you'll get great results. I added a splash of balsamic to my plate...Yum!!"
2324285,82023,2012-12-28,5,"I actually couldn't bring myself to eat this because the meat was so rare and fatty...  but everyone else said it was a perfect roast.  So I'm passing on their five-star reviews to you!  I will say, however, that the au jus was awesome and tasted great with the Yorkshire puddings I made :)"
2668181,494429,2013-01-30,5,Yummy!
497288,68724,2007-05-23,4,This was really yummy. I too used the chipotle chiles in adobo sauce.  I found it was really easy to make too. It makes ALOT of sauce. Good thing I served it over egg noodles. Thanks Mexi-Rosie
1072593,356064,2010-10-16,0,"Armed with frying pan and spatula, low and big behind, it then became child's play.  Ya gots to try this.  Made for Cook-A-Thon for Sharon123."
296809,503502,2013-08-04,5,"Made for the Goddesses of ZWT-9, this is also a much-favored traditional side-dish for the Christmas Eve dinner in Iceland. We eat it w/roast duck on that occasion, but also enjoy it w/lamb for the Easter meal. I halved the recipe for just 2 of us &amp; otherwise made it as written. Your recipe is delicious, classic for the dish &amp; a very easy-fix. Thx for sharing the recipe w/us."
49360,18992,2002-10-26,5,I made these for when my family gets the munchies. They turned out so well. Very easy. The pretzels had the best honey mustard flavor. Baked very crisp. The entire family agreed--5 stars. Thanks Donna M.

124190,33665,2011-07-18,4,"We liked these. I used brown gravy packets to substitute for the jar. I also substituted turkey for the ground beef. These were tasty. I think we prefer regular enchiladas, but it was a nice change. They were better the second day. Thanks for sharing!"
4470,24728,2002-04-23,5,"Simple easy and very attractive - I served this recipe with Turkey Kabobs, Cranberry Maple carrots and roasted potatoes. Started off with a shrimp cocktail .  Thanks again Dorothy for another keeper"
398275,380767,2012-09-02,5,"This pizza is fantastic!  I made a few substitutions but kept all ingredients in the same ""family"" as those posted.  I used artichoke bottoms, regular mayo, increased the crab and garlic and replaced the red bell pepper with sun-dried tomato.  I also used an olive tapenade instead of the sliced kalamata olives.  Thanks for sharing, duonyte!  ***Made for PRMR***"
58104,414980,2011-04-02,5,I Love cilantro but DH doesn't. So I used basil. And this was delish!Served over brown basmati rice. Thanks for the delish eats!

818980,283543,2008-07-14,5,"This marinade was phenomenal!  I was really sad that i couldn't eat it all (i had made A LOT of food!), because it was incredibly tasty"
284180,171223,2007-04-30,5,"We loved this.  I used lucid's recommended tomato sauce recipe for it, but used a different crust recipe.  Even my son who hates spinach wolfed down this pizza.  Very fresh-tasting with lots of garlic flavor."
337120,306195,2008-06-15,5,"Lovely and light flavors for summer!  I usually slave over the stove when I make risotto, but was amazed that this less intensive method worked so well.  My family said it was the best risotto I have ever made!  Thanks for sharing!"
365613,16991,2006-10-18,5,"This was great!  I got 3 thumbs up. I did double it, use a bag of chopped broccoli, and a pound of macaroni.  I also put italian seasoned bread crumbs on top since we were out of cornflaks.  Thanks for the recipe."
1330783,90502,2009-07-30,0,"Delicious! Made this yesterday, followed recipe exactly except upped cinnamon to 2 tsps. Very soft loaf. Made french toast with it this morning, my husband loved it! Great recipe. A keeper!"
89831,193305,2006-11-06,5,"Great recipe but I would have preferred the cookies to be just a little sweeter, these cookies are very fragile when baked, so cool well before removing from the pan otherwise they will break apart, thanks Kaarin, these will make a great addition to my holiday cookie platter!...Kitten:)"
41917036,324197,2014-05-06,0,"I did grilled fresh tuna w/ garlic and parmesean marinade , then cooked the penne added some saut&eacute; onions and topped with a regular spaghetti sauce dried basil parsley r great on top"

12657,25625,2002-04-29,5,"I have the almost exact same recipe too (#23836) and I positively LOVE this! Instead of spreading the peanut butter on hot toast, I spread it on the bread first, then lay the tomato slices (and lettuce/wilted spinach sometimes), and grill the bread in the oven. That way the tomato juices seep into the bread a tad, and the peanut butter gets a fresh toasty flavour as well! But your method works great too :)"
1803671035,58981,2015-01-17,4,"I thought it taste very much like a Mochalatta Chill.  Go buy the $5 Starbucks Iced coffee, the slightly sweetened one (will make 12 copycats).  WAY easier, and you know the coffee will be good, with no waiting for it to cool down!  And maybe back off on the chocolate syrup a little."
21752,173186,2011-07-05,5,"I had cooked up a batch of homemade halvah the other day and had so much that I purposely sought out a recipe for halvah parfait.  While I wouldn't say this is the ONLY dish from Israel gain international acclaim, it certainly deserves it.  This is definitely a high maintenance recipe, a lot of futzing around with pots and bowls, but the end result was delicious.  I lined the loaf tin with plastic wrap and right before serving it plopped out beautifully on the platter.  I served this up as dessert for a festive Friday night dinner.  There were 15 of us around the table and not a bit was left for seconds.  Excellent dish, worth the faff!"
176615,49431,2013-08-19,5,"Very tasty! Tender meatballs in a thick, creamy mustard sauce. My family really enjoyed the dish, but if you&#039;re not a mustard fan, I&#039;d suggest cutting the prepared mustard to 1T. Used a Circulon skillet and it did stick. Served with noodles, but rice or a wild rice mix would be very good. Quick and simple to prepare. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
1366254,395629,2009-10-22,0,Loved it!
448204,113023,2008-01-11,5,"I really liked this. I did use the low fat cottage cheese, but not the low fat yogurt-I used regular yogurt.  Foods like this are appriciated most by those who were brought up on meals similer to  this."
346576,105080,2009-01-13,5,"Yum!  I expected the kids to ""ewwww"" at it, but suprisingly they all three loved it!  I guess the cheese helped!  I halved the recipe for our family easily."
145448,100244,2004-09-29,5,This is a wonderful recipe!  I added 1/2 cup finely diced carrots and used 1 cup grated cheddar cheese instead of the velveeta.  I will certainly use this recipe again.
101113,26258,2003-11-03,4,My husband made this bread for a campfire.  It was so moist and delicious!
319881,348524,2014-01-16,5,made this last night.  so yummy and so easy!
39835,35195,2003-06-02,5,"We loved this! I used a graham cracker crust and added the chocolate chips in step 4 with the banana. I made it ahead of time so we could have it cold with cool whip. I think there is a mistake in the numbe of servings however, I cut the pie into 8 pieces but even though it is very rich I imagine it will be totally finished by morning. Will definitely be making this again."
424680,55094,2007-05-12,5,"Made this drink as directed, & it's another of Bev's winners! Originally I was going to sub a lemon-lime drink for the ginger ale, but didn't & it was happily received by all! Still, I'm curious about the lemon-lime, so another time.....! Thanks for sharing!"
83093,30071,2007-04-24,4,"What an easy, quick bread recipe! I made exactly as written, using a Miller Lite beer and without adding any herbs to the batter. The bake time was right on - 35 minutes for my oven. I threw together a compound butter with roasted garlic, fresh oregano and chives that we slathered on the warm bread. It was a great addition to our dinner. Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
1699816,106715,2011-01-14,5,A new family favorite!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.
580032,99314,2009-09-05,4,"I'm not a casserole girls, but even I have to admit this is a pretty good one.  It's easy and freezes well.  I've substituted chicken but didn't enjoy it as much.  Our kids will eat it too, so that's always a bonus!!  I didn't give it 5 stars because its not OUSTANDING, but it's definitely made it onto our recipe rotation for supper."
2867645,99992,2013-06-17,5,"Very easy marinade! I used it on shrimp, chicken, mushrooms,"
707985,114412,2007-12-30,5,"This was WONDERFUL! I used only a little more than 1 liter of water -This gave it more tang and zest - and I left out the 1/4 cup lime juice. Used real California lemons, brought in about a week ago. Incredibly good-tasting, low-cal lemonade - plenty Vitamin C - and no sugar!"
40133038,74753,2013-08-29,2,These were not very good. My husband and kids (who are used to regular pasta) thought the egg roll wraps tasted weird. I agreed they were a little weird and mushy. Not like canneloni from an Italian restaurant. I also think you could use half the spinach and throw in some mushrooms for a better flavor. I would not do these again.
937635,398844,2009-12-23,5,"Fabulous Flavors! The store had 8 oz containers of cranberries, so I used 1 bunch of cilantro (minus a handful for quesadillas I was making), one bunch of scallions (minus 2), 1 jalapeno, 3/4 cup sugar, 1 lemon (squeezed) and one block of cream cheese. It is so good! I served some on the side with the quesadillas I made for dinner and will have plenty to bring to Christmas Eve dinner tomorrow. Thanks, Alligirl, I'll definitely be making this one again!"
49861,19486,2004-06-01,5,"My goodness, how right you are, I don't want to stop eating it LOL I made some for Memorial Day, and everyone loved it. Thank you for the post. Definitly saving this one!"
1402748,2032,2009-12-06,5,I've been looking for this taste for years. It is fantastic! I used apple cider vinegar and homemade chicken stock instead of water. I also left the skin on and floured & browned the chicken before baking. Served with mashed potatoes and sliced carrots. Mmm mmm good :)
27643,29911,2003-10-17,5,"This is one of those recipes that make you ask.....how did I miss this one?? Of all meats, we make chicken the most. Both of us really love finding new ways to make it. And this is a wonderful, easy, moist, and very yummy chicken dish! The creol flavor with the orange juice is excellent. This one went into my ""keeper"" file. "
240154,270537,2008-03-16,1,"I'm sorry, either I made this complely wrong, or it is practically inedible.  There was waay too much nutmeg, the slices of veggies just sort of floated in the milk and then burned."
499479,169427,2007-05-29,3,"I loved the flavourings in the rice, but didn't like the chorizo's in this dish. Next time I will just make the rice as a yummy side dish."
46357,94382,2008-09-12,3,"This was okay, but too salty. And I used low sodium soy sauce. If the salt could be toned down, I would give this 5 stars - the other marinade flavors were really good.

I used shrimp and scallops and otherwise they both turned out fine."
384041,183500,2007-10-09,4,"I made this for the kids one night when DH and I were out and they loved it. The only negative is that the servings are very optimistic. I sliced up a full lb of carrots (the amount of glaze in the recipe stretched just fine), and my 3 kids complained that there hadn't been enough."
140132,13307,2013-04-02,5,"I made these to take on our vacation with us.  These were a big hit with all the kids.  I made them into big cookies, but they were cooked perfectly.  I loved them, as did all who tried them.  Thank you for sharing with us.  Delicious."
2533172,114267,2012-11-29,5,"I was so excited when I came across this recipe.  My grandmother (now deceased) also had this recipe, but it was lost a few years ago.  I made it for thanksgiving and it brought back so many good memories!  The recipe is delicious just as it is."
254950,147033,2006-02-26,4,Very moist cookie and good texture for not having butter or eggs.  I baked them at 375 for ten minutes and they came out great.  
329753,9272,2007-03-06,4,"I made this last night and it is delicious!!  I used Kosher salt,a s I had no canning salt, and cut back on the jalapenos a bit.  Perfect!!"
461283,201073,2007-04-18,4,"I made this last night but I skipped step #2, doesn't need it. I tossed the sprouts with Olive oil and Kosher salt then placed in the oven. I also used 4 fresh minced garlic cloves and added that for the last 5 minutes and turned down the heat to 350 until the sprouts were nicely browned and a bit softer than al dente. The outside leaves get nice and brown, mixed with the garlic it is really good. So much better than boiled!!!"
195589,387194,2009-09-21,5,"Great grilled cheese! Especially when the tomatoes and peppers are garden fresh. The only thing I did different is use unsalted butter instead of the margarine. I believe margarine is 1 molecule short of being plastic. : (  Next time, I will try sour dough bread. Thanks for posting."
329592,51692,2007-03-09,5,"This is the best beef stew I have ever made or had.  I did make minor changes.  I added an extra teaspoon of worcestershire sauce and about another cup of potatoes.  I also added celery.  In addition, I wasn't sure if my crockpot would be big enough for the amount that I made (8 servings), so I cooked mine in a dutch oven on low heat for approx. 7 hours."
198998,79324,2007-02-02,5,"We really enjoyed this!  It reminded me of bread pudding (or maybe it was just the way I made it), I prefer this to traditional cornbread.  Thanks!"
176167,63150,2015-10-14,5,"OMG!!! I modified it a little bit because I wasn&#039;t getting soft peaks, instead it seemed to be separating. I wasn&#039;t using Nutella - it was some generic hazelnut spread. So in an attempt to save it, I added  a pkg of sugar free fat free vanilla pudding and 1 cup of milk. Once it set, I topped with whipped cream. This desert has so much depth, so much flavor! The texture ended up being creamy and delightful. This will be served at my next elegant dinner party!"
2001665492,431467,2018-06-04,0,LOL What!!? I like the flaxseed peanut butter!
235982,325674,2009-10-03,4,This is actually pretty good.  If you are looking for a cute little dessert for two make this in a mug and split it between 2 small serving dishes.  Three minutes is plenty.  I also added peanut butter chips.  YUM!
631970,100075,2008-12-23,5,I enjoyed the crust of this recipe.  I used a spicy V8 juice and you would not even know it was used.  I also sprayed the pan with pam and dusted it in cornmeal to make a crunchy bottom :)  I did overstuff mine (figures lol) so it was a lil moist on the edges when sealing it but it turned out good.  I used different ingredients to suit what we had on hand but this is a good recipe :)  Thank you so much.  I hope to try the meat version next time.
682882,321803,2009-08-04,3,"The batter was very dry, as noted by the most recent reviewer, and it didn't come to the top while cooking, so that all I had was bubbling fruit with the flour/sugar/butter mixture on the bottom. I've made other cobblers in which the topping rose to the surface while cooking, but in this case there was nothing to bake golden brown! I'm not sure what I did wrong."

633023,309788,2011-08-07,5,"We have lots of fresh zucchini from our garden and I was looking for a good recipe.  This is truly a great recipe that's quick and very tasty!

51011,70173,2006-10-14,5,"Really easy to throw together, and tasty too.  I had to cook mine for a bit longer than an hour, but I think that was due to me cooking something else at the same time.  Only change I made was to add some sauted mushrooms.  Thanks so much for sharing!  Will have to have this again soon. "
101034,54435,2005-03-29,5,"This was very, very good. We loved the flavor of the sauce. I used penne rigate and hot italian sausage, which gave the sauce a nice bite. It was very simple to prepare and we are looking forward to having those great leftovers. Thanks Tish, I'll be making this often."
2098712,454978,2011-12-25,5,Wonderful!
20677,12490,2001-10-16,5,"One of the best crockpot recipes yet!! Fast, easy and delicious."
60231,31638,2003-04-17,5,"Thsi had a great taste and it was lighter than I expected it to be with all the cheese. I had one problem - I might have put too much cheese in the crust because the liquid overflowed somewhat, but my family liked it a lot,k and my husband told me to be sure to save it. (and it was very easy to prepare) "
251917,234175,2008-10-09,5,Aussie Swap #21: Excellent and easy dinner!! I served it alongside Recipe#318211 - perfect combo!
62562,200078,2007-06-23,5,I made this a little thin and then drizzled it over recipe #170022. Delicious! I love the subtle cinnamon flavor. Mmmmmmm!
329618,108248,2006-09-07,2,I had the same problem as Amykins.  I have no idea what I did wrong.  I used a 13 X 9.  I had these years ago and loved them but when I made them it was just bland.
432982,295291,2010-10-19,0,I really enjoyed these!  I did not have soymilk so I did substitute organic 2% milk with good results.   (I am not vegan but was looking for something healthy and using wheat germ).   Passed the real taste test around here- my husband and 2 kids both liked them too!   Oh yes- I added 1/2 cup of raisins just to give them a little something extra.
1017242,403973,2010-12-09,5,"I got a bumper crop of winter squash from my garden this year, and have been searching for ways to use it. This lasagna turned out great. I did use some shortcuts: I used pre-made tomato sauce and I only used ricotta and mozarella cheese. The squash from my garden had such a hard shell that I couldn't peel it and cube it up before cooking it, so I had to roast large chunks of it first, then scrape it out of the shell and add it to the onions and sage. If I had a more tender squash like a butternut or acorn, it would have worked the way you wrote it. I also added spicy Italian sausage to the pumpkin filling, but it would be fine without. Thanks for a good main-dish pumpkin recipe for me to use."
1701315,125437,2011-08-18,5,"Oh for Pete's sake!  This cake is completely addictive.  Tender, moist and definitely buttery.  Love the freshness of the berries combined with the warmth of the clove in the brown sugar streusel.  Amazing recipe as usual Kitten!"
333186,8509,2008-05-10,5,This was a great new and easy way to fix chops. the Chops were very moist and tender.  Followed recipe except used Jane's Crazy Mixed-up Salt instead of Accent.
91453,80613,2004-02-12,5,"i just bought the book, and i had to try these, because of all the great reviews. i used active dry yeast, which i proofed with the 1 cup of water, slightly warmed. then i just proceed on from there. i did have to use more flour than specified (humid singapore weather); i weighed it -about 14 1/2 ounce. try not to omit the onion powder (1 tsp), it gives a wonderful taste to these. i made them into 10 mini pig-in-blankets, and 6 cheddar rolls (rolled small pcs of dough around cubed cheese & topped with bits of cheese) and 1 mini cinnamon raisin loaf. totally yummy. the dough is quite sticky to work with."
178742,84022,2006-10-15,4,"Thanks for sharing your recipe. I thought it was really good! I took the suggestion of one reviewer and added extra olive oil, about addtional tablespoon, but I added mine before I put it in the oven. This recipe was nice for a change of flavors. I think I prefer the fresh Edamame boiled then salted... But like I said this is nice for a change in flavors.. Thanks for sharing!"
369715,486479,2012-10-30,4,These were good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written. I used onions and green peppers in the filling. I also added pepper to the eggs. My family enjoyed these. Made for Fall PAC 2012
146047,117281,2005-05-07,5,"Kittencal, these buns ARE fabulous. Yum. My 8-year-old and I shaped these into hot dog buns and the family scarfed down all but one for dinner. They have great flavor and lovely color. Worked fine with no-trans-fat shortening and skim milk. I replaced some of the bread flour with soy flour, and opted out of the sesame seeds, instead brushing with egg white to make them shiny and then following up with some butter to make them soft. Delicious. Thanks, KC!"
2310,76816,2004-06-07,5,"Lemon rubbed on roast chicken? YES!
While the chicken didn't really taste ""lemony"", the juice gave it a nice clean and fresh flavor.  I also loved the garlic which made for some delicious tasting pan juices to serve over everything on our plate.  I added some quartered red potatoes to the pan and they were perfectly done at the same time as the chicken, and were delicious mashed up with those garlicky juices. I also added some dried rosemary inside the chicken and sprinkled on the top as well as on the potatoes.  My DH and I smiled and toasted to you Marie; thanks for a wonderful meal!"
284897,504956,2013-08-12,5,"I used decaf espresso, and I also made 2, and DH didn&#039;t get his! Wonderful coffee, creamy, smooth and ohh so yummy!Thanks evelyn, wonderful recipe."
2000368870,192083,2015-08-10,3,"I wanted to try this out because I had risotto at a Italian restaurant. I would say this was good, but I don&#039;t think I like it enough to make it again. It&#039;s not restaurant-quality but then I just recently started to cook lol, so I don&#039;t know. I am glad I skipped the cream cause this dish is already very creamy as it is. This dish kinda tasted like alfredo pasta because of the parmesan."
1699307,518069,2014-08-22,0,"I am not a soup lover, but I love this!!!!!! YUMMY!!!!!!!!!  Awesome, with all the flavors in this!"
39479,14178,2002-05-02,5,"Delicious!  I was worried because I had never made a punch b4.  Everyone just luved it!  I even received compliments from the bride to be and her mother thanking me for making this punch for the shower.  Only thing I would change is maybe half the amount of ginger ale.  Otherwise, EXELLENT!! :-)"
226863,309187,2011-06-18,5,"I also left the whole berries in the tea....didn't see that we should remove them or blend them in the recipe.  My DD loved it.  She is home for Father's Day!  It was a bit sweet for me, but I am a wine or water drinker.  My review is based on DD's review....had to make it again for her, which is good since I bought a carton of raspberries and needed to use them.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for my teammate during ZWT7."
280271,225219,2008-06-09,5,Wow! This has lots of flavor. The only thing missing was some salt. I made as posted. Came out delicious. Served it with a side of corn bread and dinner was ready. This is quick and easy to prepare.What more can you ask for. Thanks for posting.
881152,359458,2009-04-01,4,"This dish was really very good.  I needed to use up some pork sausage I'd gotten on sale so I thought I'd give it a try.

I used ""lite"" sour cream and whole wheat egg noodles.  My boys gobbled it right up and asked for seconds.  We'll definitely make this again.  Thanks!"
297076,138331,2006-08-09,5,Yum! Yum! Yum! Yum! We were out of bread crumbs so we used finely crushed Pringles Ranch light chips... YUM YUM YUM. My kids went nuts for these! They were fantasic! Thanks for sharing!
672534,6583,2017-11-20,4,"I'm re-writing my review based on hubby's reaction to this served the second time. I had fresh cardamom, and I think that altered the taste enough for him to dislike it. I followed the recipe except I left out the lemon juice because I remembered not caring for it the first go-round. I also altered the order of cooking things. I added the spices after browning the meat, because last time they really burned in the pan. This way, they still got &quot;bloomed&quot; but not burned. My recommendation is to reduce the amount of cardamom if you have fresh (it loses its' potency rather quickly.) I should have cut it at least in half. The first time I cooked it in the crock pot, this time on the stove. Either way is fine, but you MUST brown the meat to get the best flavor."
141012,39589,2006-07-29,5,I made this ages ago and it was superb! The whole family loved it. I never could locate the recipe again as I couldn't remember the name of the dish. It really needs a name that is not so generic. I recognised the recipe today when I read the ingredients. Thanks for sharing.
381571,159851,2007-01-22,4,"Whoops, instead of ""rubbing"" the chicken with the spices, we rolled the chicken in the spices! The result was so spicy it nearly burned our tongues off-- but the plain chicken pieces we cooked in the same pan were milder and more manageable. Very tasty! This is definitely one to make again."
442070,254495,2009-04-25,5,"Lovely, Lovely Lovely!  And I do not even like curry... Well I didn't...
We went on a holiday for a week and I brought back 40 plus new spices as my gift to myself... to be honest I don't know what half of them are, I like a challenge, so looked up kaffir leaves on my beloved Recipezaar and voila! a new recipe to try out!  
This was so tasty, I had to use chicken breast as that is what I had defrosted and it was so succulent, it did cook a bit quicker than thighs would have so next time I will thicken the sauce a bit with corn starch.  
I served it with a Moroccan  bean dish I made and it's mildness paired well with the curry.  I love Gordon Ramsay's recipes and will use this again.  Thank you for posting it."
254128,163788,2006-05-31,3,Fast and easy. Went great over noodles with some sort of weird beef cut I managed to find in the freezer lol.
486725,423974,2010-10-07,3,I also added vinegar. We liked this combination - it was very different.
2809486,151660,2013-05-01,5,this is a great and simple recipe. its one of the best tasting frosting I have ever tasted. don&#039;t let that pic fool you. its fluffy and easy to spread. the picture makes it look thin like it would slide right off the cake. its the best. im shocked more people haven&#039;t tried it! do yourself a favor and whip some up today! you wont be sorry
174096,476026,2012-06-03,5,These are so fun!!  And the different colored peppers make them very festive.  Very quick and easy to prepare.  Thanks for sharing!
805586,135350,2012-03-20,5,"Came out great, wife was very impressed and I didnt have cream so I used more milk and butter with a little bit of alfredo sauce that I had from a previous pasta night. The recipe was great and this will become a regular dish that I make. I will never ever make Kraft again!!!"
454068,131628,2009-04-29,5,"I've always made beef enchiladas with red sauce. And yes my son too wanted me to make the white sauce enchiladas. My family and I loved this recipe, it was very delicious. My only regret is that I wish I could make it sooner. This will definitely stay in my cookbook. Thank you vivmom"
58038,257588,2007-11-11,5,Really enjoyed these in my chicken noodle soup!  It reminds me of challah that we usually put in our soup but this has some cheese flavor.  It is a nice twist.
323107,14302,2007-08-28,4,"I also used a different filling, but the dumpling dough was right on!"
119445,72596,2005-02-12,4,Very nice and light! Love that it is so  quick and esy to to make. Thinking it would be good with shrimp also. Thanks for posting. 
540142,177783,2009-06-03,5,Simple and delicious. 1/8 c mayo was plenty. I used 1 packet splenda instaed of sugar.
226294,25094,2008-09-01,5,"My 10 yr. old son has rated this his number-one-all-time-favorite meal!  This recipe is so easy that we don't wait for special occasions to make it, although we make it for special occasions, too.  I have altered the recipe only slightly...I pound the chicken breasts lightly and used sliced mozzarella instead of the shredded.  My son and I both heartily thank you, Heather."
293410,277342,2008-03-16,5,"I've been enjoying this all week! Granola is such a great quick breakfast and yours is fabulous. I too was generous with the cinnamon (of course:-) I used agave nectar for the honey, and all of the suggested nuts plus walnuts and pumpkin seeds. I especially like the chopped apples in this. I love it best with vanilla soy or rice milk and lots of chopped banana, but it's also lovely over my homemade tofu vanilla-almond pudding. Anyway, thanks for a GREAT granola!"
345731,164519,2009-08-31,4,This was really good. I marinated pork loin chops overnight and grilled on the BBQ - SO good. Thanks for the recipe!
1195537,244871,2009-05-19,5,Delicious salad! The buttery avocado with the sweet papaya was very nice! I added some green onions and sprinkled Cilantro over. Excellent with blackened fish.
291235,56645,2006-11-19,5,"These cookies are ridiculous. They are SO good. Rich, just like you said, and... agh.. thanks for sharing this. A million times over lol. :D"
684761,181373,2010-02-21,5,YUM! this recipe made 36 regular sized muffins (when filling the cups 1/2 to 3/4 full).  i covered my blueberries with flour and mixed in while they were still frozen and they came out perfectly.  on the first batch i rotated after 10 mins of baking and the middles of some of the muffins caved in.  on the second batch i rotated after 15 mins and i didn't have that problem.  i really like the nutty flavor that the olive oil gives to this muffin. it tastes both yummy and healthy.
215057,68883,2007-01-09,4,"This was excellent as a side dish to the Roast Pork (char shu)Chinese
Recipe #811543 that I fixed with it.  A good compliment of flavors between the two.
The red wine vinegar really made a difference in bringing out the flavors of the carrots, coconut and raisins- very good.  A keeper!"
675287,286069,2008-12-29,5,"Just delicious!  I have made this quiche several times now and we always look forward to having it again!  Sometimes I switch it up and add black olives, onions and feta cheese in place of the Asiago and parmesan, for a Greek flair.  Great either way!"
286566,311140,2009-11-22,5,"Made this for the DM and she thoroughly.  Idid omit the coconut as I didn't have any and used a sugar free strawberry jam and the DM gave it the big thumbs up with I'll have that any time thanks.  Thank you mikekey, made for Every Day a Holiday Tag."
2000648239,345502,2015-11-07,5,Thank you so much for posting this! We don&#039;t have jiffy corn muffin mix where i live. Now i can make the recipe i was planning for my dinner party tomorrow night!
625696,277833,2010-01-20,3,"Surprisingly, this had very little flavor for us.  I used Taco Bell Taco Sauce (#60254) and we topped with sour cream.  The chicken was dry and although the fragrance was good, the flavor was lacking.  Maybe adding some onion and bell pepper rings to the packets would help??"
317923,27208,2009-10-15,5,"This is a great recipe simply because of how easy it is to prepare versus the great meal that you get in return.  My only recommendation is to definitely cut back on the dressing as my roast was WAY too salty.  I threw in some baby red potatoes, baby carrots and a sliced sweet onion to cook with the meat and it turned out well."
1179225,402762,2018-05-21,5,This did taste like that old classic. Thanks for sharing the recipe. It was a nice change from usual my usual burger.
1802592882,77087,2014-03-17,5,This was delicious and super easy to make! I added an avocado to it and it gave it a great creamier taste.
135566,59427,2008-03-03,4,"The topping was too sticky to ""spread"" over the fruit, so I dropped it by spoonfuls and then poured over the melted butter.  The end result was wonderful!  Crunchy, golden brown crust that puffed up while baking and came out beautifully.  My total bake time was 35 minutes.  I also used  Smart Balance in place of the butter, Wildnerness Lite Cherry Pie Filling, and Bisquick Heart Smart to lower fat/calories.  I will make this often, but will probably stir some of the melted butter into the topping to make it easier for me to spread.  Thank you for a wonderful dessert!"
273071,92265,2006-05-19,5,"I love this recipe.  Very good and differnt from most rhubarb dessert recipes.  I may try to add less sugar to the sauce next time but over all great recipe.  I made the batter the night before and was going to put it in the refrige for the morning but, when I saw how light and fluffy the batter was figured I should make them right away.  We heated up the waffles in the toaster oven and warmed up the sauce.  Great way to have a quick filling breakfast."
362983,5297,2006-11-11,5,"I loved this chicken. It was quick, easy, healthy and delicious - it wins on all counts! I used regular orange juice, 3 cloves of garlic and added a touch of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce just a tad. I also cooked the chicken on a lower heat so it didn't come out dry at all. Gotta make this again!"
361931,340457,2009-02-02,4,"This was very good in flavor -- especially the second day!!  Not as creamy as I would have hoped, but that might have been my fault (had to use part evaporated milk and part regular milk).  Will try again using all evaporated milk.  The only other thing was that a lot of the butter actually ended up pooling at the top, so might cut down on the butter next time."
1248806,69850,2009-07-07,5,"I had an abundance of blueberries to use up, so I decided to make these for DH and I for breakfast.  The sauce is awesome dripped over the top of some piping hot pancakes.  We loved each and every bite!"
146742,371704,2015-09-01,5,"This was delicious and so easy.  I used half romano and half  parmesan cheese and grilled them on a stove-top grill pan.  I left out the salt, also. I will be making this recipe often in the future."
33588,32579,2006-06-24,5,"Wonderful and tasty,followed recipe exactly the chops were perfect!Will make often,thanks Linda."
246145,16531,2007-11-16,3,"I didn't really like it much. It was to sickly sweet for me. My kids inhaled it though, which is why I gave it 3 stars. I probably won't make this again."
192581,110362,2005-05-11,5,"Made this last night for dinner and thought it tasted great. However, I did use less butter, substituted low-fat yogurt for the sour cream and served it with extra hot sauce on the side. This would be a terrific dish to serve for brunch too. Thanks!"
162826,136578,2006-04-30,5,"CAMZMOM, delicious and so very different for all the other B-Cheese Casseroles. The broccoli stays... like broccoli. I loved that! Made for PAC06-Spring. Thx Caroline"
53932,50150,2006-02-04,5,"I love homemade potato chips and this is the way I always make them.
They take more than a few minutes to fry as I like mine on the brown side.  I add hot salt or greek seasoning for variety."
126104,17600,2011-05-31,0,"These are pretty good, but pretty much *just* regular cukes and onions.  Not horrible, but probably not one I'd call a ""favorite"".  Sorry."
24485,47492,2006-12-19,4,I love Hershey's specialty kisses for Christmas baking. These are a change from the blossom recipes. The only problem I consistently have with the recipe (and many others of this type) is having the powdered sugar turn gummy when removed from the oven. Any ideas?
124115,73012,2004-01-30,0,Turned out very well but an amateur cook would have been lost.  I used filets instead of T-Bones and they worked fine--reduced cooking time to 5 minutes in oven.  Step 5--cannot reduce stock that much in 20 minutes.  No temperature for oven--I used 400.  Step7--add steaks to what?  I put them in the sauce for about 45 seconds each then seared them in iron skillet for 1 minute then put them on 400 oven for 5 minutes--perfect!  Used sauce for dipping as opposed to drizzling.  Good recipe--would give it an 8.  Thanks.
330636,49337,2007-05-13,5,"I got rave reviews from everyone who ate it. I will definitely make it again. The recipe was easy to follow.  After the 75 minutes, I left it in the oven with the door ajar for 40 minutes."
89831,95019,2004-07-04,5,"Oh yummy! I actually made this sauce yesterday to serve with my gigantic grilled hotdogs, what a big hit this sauce was, everyone just loved it! I think I added more than 3 cloves of garlic, more like 2 Tbsps! and left out the cloves. This is a nice change from the regular ketchup, it has a fantastic flavour.. it was so delicious! thanks for sharing Andypandy, I will be making this again, I am wondering how it would be on hambergers?...Kitten:)"
305531,32295,2006-07-12,5,This was really good.  The saffron really adds a nice color and flavor.  We served this with grilled salmon and it was a great match.
539686,37655,2008-06-29,4,"This makes a very tasty blueberry pie. It is easy and fast to put together, which is what I was looking for. It is still not quite as good as a traditional two crust pie, but if you are short on time, this is great. Made for ZWT 4's trip to Canada."
2002305435,114729,2018-10-19,5,I have made this for years and not only at Christmas but throughout the year. It's good with romaine letter you can dip it easily. I also use Italian and sourdough bread. .
2001414718,157958,2017-07-29,5,I used gingernuts biscuits instead because that was what i got in the cupboard instead of graham crackers. I also add sliced almonds....and we all love it.
598015,37780,2008-03-24,5,"This was so easy and a great success for the big family Easter dinner I had at my home last night.  This recipe filled in for another one that went bad, so it was a great back up and I will make it again. P.S.  Didn't use breadcrumbs and didn't miss it at all. Thanks for sharing."
2001803003,442904,2017-11-21,5,"I've never fried sage leaves before, but now that I have, I'm totally addicted to them!! I always use dried sage for flavoring, but when I have the time, I'm going to fry them. The recipe I created for my blog was a butternut squash pasta dish featuring roasted butternut squash, porcini mushrooms, white wine, roasted garlic, pine nuts, and fried sage. I crumbled some of the sage into the pasta pot and used the rest for garnish. OMG, it was insanely delicious!! The fried sage really added to an already sensational dish! Thanks for posting these instructions!"
333840,14756,2010-12-30,4,"Not the best Butter Tarts I've had, but very good! There is a huge difference in the taste of these tarts a day later. Fresh I really didn't like them at all and actually ended up making another huge double batch of tarts using the filling I usually use for Butter Tart Squares, because I liked them so little I didn't want to put them out for Christmas. My usual recipe for the squares made a great tart, but I tasted one of these tarts again the next day and while I still think my usual recipe is better, these tasted totally different than the night before when they were fresh. The one plus to these tarts is that they are not nearly as sweet as my usual recipe and others I've had, which if you're having multiple other sweets can be a good thing. <br/><br/>I might make this recipe again, I will just make sure I make them at least a day before I need them. Not sure why it makes a difference but it really did make a huge difference."
461255,57751,2007-03-06,3,"Since I'm vegetarian, I made this with Quorn ""chicken"" tenders.  I reduced the recipe to 4 servings - since that is the amount in one bad of quorn - but the quantity of dressing was WAY too much.  It seems like Ina Garten likes plenty of sauce.  I would definitely reduce the dressing by 1/2 next time.  Otherwise, the flavors were fantastic."
137428,384091,2010-03-09,5,"I made this for my son's Eagle Court of Honor. I wanted to honor the Boy Scout s'mores tradition, but I needed something simple, that would easily serve a large crowd, could be made ahead, and that was somewhat more elegant than regular s'mores. This was perfect!  It seemed a little heavy on the chocolate to me, and I wanted more marshmallow, so I used more than the 1/2 cup of marshmallow creme, just randomly blopping spoonfuls of it over the chocolate. I served it more as a spread, with a knife, rather than a dip, in my 10"" quiche dish. (I'm not sure they are making graham cracker sticks anymore. I certainly couldn't find any.) It lent itself to a beautiful presentation with graham cracker squares on a silver tray next to it, and absolutely everyone raved about it. I warmed it for a minute in the microwave right before serving. Next time I think I will stick it under the broiler instead, to toast the marshmallow fluff and warm it through, for more of a s'moresy effect. Thanks so much Rollin!"

Thanks so much MaeEast"

I used sub rolls for our rolls and shaped the burgers oblong to fit the bun.  Worked great!  This is a winner, right here.  Come and get one!"
424680,280765,2008-07-22,5,"Was going to make just half a recipe of this chowder, but then decided to go for the whole thing & share with some neighbors! Used Vadalia onions for this as well as adding almost 2 cans of cream corn! Because of additional nutrition, I left the potatoes unpeeled! The result was an extremely tasty chowder! Another time I might include shredded chicken instead of the pork, just for a change! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Tagged, made & reviewed in Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup cooking game]"
116687,42603,2008-12-17,5,"Easy and good!  Used seasoned panko crumbs, fresh grated parmesan and added garlic powder to crumb mixture.  Dipped in flour first, then ranch, then breadcrumbs.  Baked on a rack so it was crispy on all sides."
2001390859,47515,2017-02-13,0,"cooking shrimp for 10 minutes...lol. Even funnier, the recipe is followed by a &quot;next up video&quot;: how not to overcook shrimp. Best results will be with gulf shrimp. I get them fresh here in NOLA. Sauteeing the shells first in olive oil with garlic and chilis will yield a more flavorful dish. Once the shells have turned pink and crisp, scoop them into a strainer and let the excess oil drain back into the pan. Proceed with the recipe."
895132,401555,2010-01-06,4,"Very good!! Used all rice milk and no water because rice milk is quite watery. Letting it simmer for some minutes does the trick to get a rich cocoa. I let 1/4 vanilla bean simmer in the mixture and added a tiny piece of 90% chocolate to have it a little silkier and less watery. That was really good, I think it will be my standard recipe for rice milk cocoa!

1399147,309457,2009-10-21,4,"This is a great cake, but I used about 3/4 bottle of rum to plump the fruit on the stove.  

My ex's Jamaican Mom used to keep her fruit in a crock under her kitchen sink, full of gallons of rum to which she would add dried fruit occasionally.  WHen she made her cakes she used a slotted ladel to take out the ingredients- but they were fully (FULLY) saturated with the rum. 

Her cakes were definately RUM cakes, not rum flavored cakes.  

Thanks for the recipe!  It's great."
142435,10096,2006-12-28,5,Delicious cookies. I did not make the glaze since I felt the rasberry jam was sweet enough. Thanks for posting.
169430,388420,2009-09-07,5,I skipped the bacon (personal choice) and used a green onion instead of dry onion. The soup has a wonderful flavor and is a pleasure to eat. As a plus it simply could not be any quicker or easier. I love garbanzo beans and this is another way to enjoy them. Made for Photo Tag.
312322,186256,2009-04-17,5,"I made this on the gas ring based on a fellow reviewer's experience. Used olive oil not butter, fresh parsley and fresh rosmary.
A guest who never eats chicken was tempted enough to taste it.
Simple, healthy, easy, delicious, what more can you ask for in a recipe?"
496803,334528,2012-08-25,5,"Very nice!  As written, it has a bit of zip, but isn't crazy-spicy.  I'll add more horseradish and Tabasco next time for a bit more heat.  Went great with the fresh Dungeness crab I had for lunch.  Made for ZWT8"
1480997,1406,2009-12-12,5,"AWESOME recipe.  Simple and authentic tasting.

To the other reviewer who gave the unnecessary 1-star rating - you stated the meat came out dry.  Try baking in an oven (convection if you have it) and place the meat on a cookie sheet.  Add water to the bottom of the pan below the cookie sheet (or in a separate pan if you are putting it on a baking pan) to keep moisture in the oven. 

Cooking only takes 30-45 minutes if you slice it thin enough.  

AWESOME recipe!  Thanks for sharing."
482376,95603,2011-02-09,5,"I really enjoyed the flavor combinations in this simple wrap. I used leftover rotisserie chicken, dried tarragon and a gluten-free wrap. I enjoyed the added crunch and flavor of the sugar snap peas. This made for a yummy, quick dinner. Made for the Aussie/NZ Swap"
186855,212925,2009-12-16,5,"I can't believe these have never been review. They are fantastic. Didn't take hardly any time at all to cook either.

246507,393637,2010-06-21,5,Delicious!  I've made these a couple of times now and taken them to 2 pot lucks.  People rave about them.  I keep forgetting to take a picture of them before they're all gone!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.  I did not use the mini muffin tins.  I just placed the phyllo cups on a cookie sheet.
871928,22782,2012-07-14,5,"This is now my ""go to"" spaghetti sauce and lasagna base. I don't measure the herbs but chop up  fresh herbs and throw them in, including oregano and marjoram.

1802600676,373619,2014-03-20,5,This recipe was awesome and very easy! Full of flavor! I used turkey smoked sausage and brown rice. My family just loved it!!!!
357358,129392,2008-08-29,4,"Good flavor and loved the crunch added by the nuts. The bleu cheese was a nice addition and not overwhelming. It would have helped to have a cup measurement for the potatoes since ""large"" is relative. Made this on Wednesday night, but there was a lot of liquid in the bowl on Friday so I recommend making only what you will use. Thanks."
461834,411900,2013-09-30,5,"Just loved this flank steak!!!  I made this as written, making my own &quot;Red Wine Vinaigrette&quot; (which I combined 2 different recipes to my liking) and then followed as written with the dry rub ingredients.  I agree with TeresaS, don&#039;t use just red wine vinegar, that would be way to strong a flavor on it&#039;s own (as it appears another reviewer may have done).  We had my DS and his girlfriend over for dinner and she stated that this was her favorite of all the marinated flank steaks I have made since their 3-4 year relationship together and having dinners over here!!!  We cooked it to about medium and then served it with twice baked potatoes, green beans and  garlic bread, yummy!!!  Thank so much for sharing the recipe, I am sure we will make this often!!  Congrats again on your football pool win!!"
1802492620,308781,2014-02-15,1,"These cookies are like cake batter. The dough was perfect until I added the water and soda, then it  was just like a ginger cake. Not a chance they could be rolled"
34146,30461,2002-06-06,5,"LOL, I've been making Boca burgers like that for years! I think the roasted peppers are what makes the dish. They're really yummy prepared that way. I also like them with onions and baby bella mushrooms sauteed in wine."
113928,279279,2008-05-03,5,"Ok, first, not to be pedantic, but this is technically a Cottage Pie because it uses beef (Shepherd's uses lamb), but when it tastes this good, who cares?  Really loved it, and will follow this recipe from now on.  Very easy to put together, wouldn't change anything direction or ingredient-wise.  Thanks psyko4cats!"
681667,101438,2008-12-25,5,"I added a little onion powder and garlic powder and I used seasoned salt for half of the salt. I also use a variety of nuts--peanuts, mixed nuts, and cashews. Delicious!"
1353266,468051,2013-03-21,1,Try another recipe.  This one was very oily and greasy.  It also stuck to my greased pan.  I had to pry the cake out of the pan.  Which was surprising because the cake was so greasy.  The taste was ok.  You may want to try something else instead.
1006032,51546,2011-01-18,0,"This is a GREAT recipe!!!!I followed exactly the process, then divided into balls and froze them i thaw in refridgerator over night then put in a very small bread pan, and bake.  Yummy Bread !!!"
454849,257229,2007-11-10,5,I made these cupcakes for my daughters first birthday party and everyone loved them. In fact that they are still talking about them. They were delicious and not too sweet. Thanks for the great recipe.
1798629,104662,2016-10-11,4,"I've been making this forever! Personally, I don't like vanilla so I leave that out but almond extract is a nice substitute. A twist of fresh orange peel tastes better than zest. I also prefer a cinnamon stick so you don't end up with cinnamon sludge at the bottom. This works well with espresso and pinon coffee. Also delicious as iced coffee! Thanks!"

573325,343295,2009-02-07,4,"Kittycatmom, these taste absolutely gorgeous! The sour cream really gives them the little extra something. It's just their texture I wasn't very happy with: They were very soft and fell apart when trying to serve them. Perhaps it's because I used frozen berries that started to thaw during the making?!
In summer I'll try again with fresh ones.
Thanks for posting this.

457661,213546,2010-05-07,5,Delicious! I doubled this recipe. I didn't have lemon pepper so I did a little lemon juice and some black pepper. I also used margarine because I needed it to be dairy free.
1789175,429328,2011-01-08,5,Deborah made this for us when she was visiting and it is FANTASTIC!
2001443553,14979,2017-03-18,1,"You wanna tell us if this goes in the oven? We're not psychic. All I got out of this recipe was a gooey, runny, syrupy mess. An oven would have helped. And 3/4 cup of sugar? Are you crazy? Like bananas aren't sweet enough. If you use this recipe make sure the custard base is as thick as caulk, hot as hades, and you've got overripe banana and cut the sugar to 1/3 cup. You might stand a chance."
44420,18072,2003-11-02,4,This is a great dessert when you want something that is fast and tasty.  It's a nice blend of sweet and tart if you use Granny Smiths or other tart varieties.  
2001939229,139664,2018-01-18,5,Our family loved it. Best venison recipe Iâve ever made. Thank you!

2001612678,42169,2017-08-11,0,"Tail on is visually more appealing than &quot;tail off&quot;, makes the shrimp &quot;look&quot; larger (tricking both your brain and your stomach,) and may help in not over cooking that end of the shrimp."
208818,31020,2005-05-29,5,This is the first time I'd ever tried a vinegar based sauce. I really liked it - so did most of my guests.
541554,15242,2008-10-27,5,We loved it!!  I'd recommend cutting the recipe in half though if you are cooking for less than five people.  It makes quite a bit!
2595810,14596,2012-12-28,0,"This is a great, quick and easy recipe. My guests loved it (one asked to take leftovers home). I used the HVR dip, rather than the dressing, mix and reduced the amount by about a tsp as recommended by another reviewer and it was perfect. I'll definitely make this one again."
37305,130476,2005-12-08,5,This was great asparagus!  I halved the recipe and used frozen petite asparagus spears.  Only 2 in our family normally like asparagus but 5 of us ate and loved this!  Thanks for posting...no leftovers here!
163872,16416,2005-02-13,5,"I liked this one!  Very simple, vegetable ingredients can be tweaked to anyone's liking (cauliflower will be an addition next time I make this and asparagus come spring).  I like my veggies ultra crisp, so I cut the time waay back, putting the pan in the oven at the tail end of cooking time for a chicken I had roasting.  Great dish for 'multi-tasking', can't wait for summer veggies to try in this.  Thanks Bergy!"
202655,108651,2005-09-08,5,I made this last night and we all loved it! It was very delicious. My husband is not a chicken fan so it was nice to hear he liked it! I did put a little shredded cheese on after the soup but before the Ritz crackers. Thank you for a new dinner!
54678,190812,2007-09-24,5,I also added in some spinach. Will repeat this recipe.
236532,104475,2007-05-21,5,"I made this for a family reunion and it was a big hit!  Being pressed for time, I used canned lentils and jarred roasted peppers and that worked beautifully.  I also used soy feta to satisfy the vegans in the crowd.  It was fully enjoyed by all :)"
595840,117321,2008-11-06,5,I took these to our annual chili cook-off at work.  They were a big hit.  I used 2% milk and they were delicious.  I liked the lighter texture.
166294,139555,2007-05-09,5,"We loved these, Marg!  It reminded me so much of a hoagie sandwich my elementary school used to serve that I LOVED.  :)  This definitely makes the regular meal rotation.  Thanks for sharing the recipe."

2753255,126997,2013-03-25,5,This was one of the easiest recipes that I have ever made.  I can&#039;t believe how well it turned out.  We even took some of the dough and made hot pockets for my children.  It tasted lovely.
328931,133908,2006-09-30,5,"This bread is truly wonderful and as syrinx said I too can think of many occasions to make this. It can be very versatile. It's like a complete sandwich without the hassle of actually making one. We had this bread for breakfast I halved this recipe as it is only DH, baby and I. I made one change in place of bacon I used a paprika salami. DH bit into this and said mmmmhhh this is really nice. Thats quite a compliment coming from the strong silent type ;-). Thanks chef Zee for a great recipe"
699555,389950,2009-09-22,5,"This was a big hit when I served it.  Mine turned out a bit too garlicy for my taste, but perhaps my clove was larger.  I added some softened cream cheese to balance the garlic and it was delightful!  Served with fresh vegetables and pita chips."
1212261,272015,2009-04-16,5,"Mangia! My Italian Family makes a variation of this for Christmas Eve. Soak dried fish in cold H2O at least 24 hours, changing water 3 or 4 times. Omit flour dredging as this makes the fish stickier than you would believe. Add fresh garlic cloves from at least 3 whole bulbs to the fryng oil. Leave the garlic in for a couple of batches of fish and it becomes ""golden brown and delicious"" to serve w/ the fish. Mmmmmmm!"

482238,110749,2008-04-08,5,"I thought this was outstanding as written, and capable of improvisation. For instance, frozen strawberry Daquiri mix makes a very nice ice cream too. I can't wait to try banana Daquiri mix! And you can mix in smaller pieces of candy (like mini M&Ms) for an added kick."
261194,23687,2005-12-01,1,"Brining is the culinary snake-oil of the early 21st century.  Its proponents claim that even a half-hour sojourn in a salt solution makes a revolutionary difference in the moistness of a chicken breast, when the realities are that (1) the salt solution can't even begin to penetrate to the center of the meat in that time, (2) the concentrated salinity near the surface makes ruinously salty pan drippings, and (3) you can easily cook an unbrined chicken breast so that it's perfectly juicy every time â just follow the recipe in Mastering the Art of French Cooking, for example.  Granted, roasting a turkey is a lot harder, but here too the traditional methods â frequent basting, covering the breast with cheesecloth â produce a turkey with pink, moist, pliable, and rich-tasting breast meat.  Probably the single most important thing in roasting turkey is the simplest: don't overcook it!  When the turkey rests for half an hour after roasting (another important step), the juices that exude from it are going to be somewhat pink, but that's as it should be; the reddish color comes from the pigment in the bones, not from ""rare"" meat.  While brining may arguably increase the moisture content in cooked meat, that is not the whole story.  The salt in the brine denatures the meat protein, just as cooking a custard denatures the egg protein; and like a cooked custard, brined meat may hold a great deal of moisture, but it does not really taste moist.  Cook's Illustrated magazine, a leading advocate of brining, compares brined meat to frankfurters, also prepared with a lot of salt, and that is exactly the effect of brining â it transforms the fresh juiciness of unbrined meat into the firm rubberiness of a hot dog.  And while some people report moister turkeys after brining, I suspect this is an artifact; my guess is that they either use an updated recipe with shorter cooking times, or simply pay closer attention to how the turkey is coming along.  Anyway, most panaceas are suspect, and this one should be no exception."
2200652,475446,2012-03-13,5,5 stars I love this recipe
246482,166030,2007-06-20,5,Very nice. I made tacos tonight and used the  recipe.I didnt tell hubby that it wasnt a package and he said he really enjoyed the meal. So it passed the test. I made a bottle of it and will use this more often in other meals.
795588,42564,2008-07-22,4,"I made this recipe exactly as written with two deviations; I reduced the oil to 2 tbsp of olive oil and used russet potatoes. The flavor of these potatoes is wonderful. Before reading this recipe, I never thought of using ranch mix in this manner. I used 2 large russet baking potatoes peeled and cut into chunks. They were fluffy and creamy on the inside and crispy crunchy on the outside. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again. Thank you!"

937635,160813,2011-01-21,5,"Excellent easy recipe! I made it for a special dinner with a good friend of mine and she loved it! I cut back a lot on the sesame oil because I only had the dark oil and I'm not very fond of the taste of it. So I used just a tiny bit in the saute with olive oil, and then a shy tablespoon in the sauce. I also just mixed the sauce in a bowl by hand with the soy sauce, sugar, little bit of sesame, and 1tbs of jarred chopped garlic in olive oil.  I really liked this recipe and am so glad to have it in hand, thanks spatchcock!"

59064,218536,2008-06-02,5,This was a good recipe to make with my 7 year old. I helped by providing extra muscle as the dough must be creamed properly. Well worth the effort.
114238,54257,2013-03-08,5,"Sorry if this posts twice, my internet connection was acting funky when I tried to post it the first time.<br/><br/>I made this recipe for the first time last night and it came out perfect!  (Usually it takes a few tries...) My entire family enjoyed it, even my two 10-year-olds who usually won't eat anything except mac & cheese.  <br/><br/>After putting the sauce on the meatloaf to cook, I made another double batch for the table.  My husband loved it!  <br/><br/>The only thing I did differently was that I crushed half a sleeve of Ritz crackers instead of using the bread.  Based on someone's review saying the half & half was too much, I didn't measure the half & half, just poured in a little at a time until I got a soft, but not too soft consistency for the chopped meat.  I think I ended up using about half a cup anyway.  <br/><br/>I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus.  <br/><br/>I think this would work great making it in muffin tins or mini loaf pans to serve at a potluck. I would also use this recipe to make cocktail meatballs served with toothpicks to dip in the sauce. <br/><br/>It was so easy but came out so delicious!  This is going to be my meatloaf recipe from now on.  Thank you so much Nita!!"
62005,122147,2007-07-03,4,"Very tasty, but pretty mild - I added 4 Tbsp jalapenos and it just got there (will add more next time).
Thanks for posting."
323186,281771,2008-10-07,5,"Very very nice!  like the other reviewers I didn't chill before baking. I forgot the recipe called for it, I'm sure it would intensify the flavours, but it's really good anyway.
So easy and quick to put together, 
the simple sauce is rich and creamy and the chicken, so tender that it melts in the mouth!
I served this with rice, and  Recipe #239114 by Chef #354675,  giving us an excellent supper!  Thank you, LifeIsGood!"
461834,448538,2011-06-15,5,Great waffles!!  I made 1/2 of the recipe and did opt to add the baking powder in order to lessen the time.  I sprinkled them with some powdered sugar and served them with some strawberries.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 7.
95743,124351,2005-08-24,5,"I thought this was a marvelous way to prepare cod.  It was tender, buttery and luscious.  And simple to prepare."
357358,296587,2010-05-26,0,"Five spice powder is a Chinese spice and seems odd in an Italian recipe. With only 4 tablespoons of sugar in 7+ cups of liquid (not 5) I am concerned as to how sweet it can be. While this recipe looks interesting, I am concerned about the other ingredients such as the Dijon mustard. I will check back and see if you actually make this, since you stated in the forums that you created this in your head. I hope the quantities are adjusted to what looks more like a workable recipe."
505972,243367,2007-08-24,4,"I loved the lemony dressing, which was both sweet and tangy, although I would prefer to use less of the dressing for this amount of salad.  This was a satisfying and relatively low-fat treat; perfect for a summer's day.  I especially enjoyed the the use of two of my favorite flavors, lemon and basil, in such a simple recipe."
36128,44001,2008-02-20,5,"This recipe is sooo good!  I had to use 2 cream of mushroom soups, but it was just fine!  I used the cheddar cheese french fried onions on the top, the full 3 cups cheddar cheese, and this was well recieved by everyone, including those who HATE broccoli!  LOL  I will be making this again!  Thanks so much!"
552613,365990,2010-03-30,5,"I rather enjoy a good Greek salad and this one was indeed good. I especially liked that it was a recipe for one which allowed me to enjoy it on my own for lunch without thinking half a recipe was going to go to waste. A really easy, healthy and taste lunch. Made for Veg*n swap."
136997,4682,2013-07-04,5,"So good! Since lemons are very pricy in my neck of the woods, I added the zest to the marinade. I chose to bake the fish instead of grilling. Definitely a repeat recipe. :)"
75497,202774,2007-03-30,1,"This did not work at all for me.  We tasted the chicken and wound up throwing most of it away.  After 8 hours, the sour cream sauce was  watery and grainy looking, and even with all those fresh mushrooms, the sauce had no flavor.   The only change I made was to also add in some sliced onion.  I'm sorry to leave a poor review, but we won't be trying this one again.  Thanks anyway."
80079,58827,2003-08-21,5,"Very good!  I love cranberries...but they're hard to find in August! Had to settle ofr frozen, but this was delish!  Thanks, Derf!"
232204,179081,2006-07-30,5,"Fabulous! Recipe turned out just peachy!  I had tiny little peaches so I ended up with 7 cups of sliced fruit.  I made this in a deep dish and  ran low on top crust so I did the latice. I had another peach pie recipe that called for grenadine syrup (better homes gardens) so I thought I'd add some to this pie, 3 TBL spns.  very nice.   I almost forgot about the lemon, cinnamon and nutmeg for the top, but once I mixed it up it seemed like TOO much spice for the top, so just a dash of cinn, nutmeg and sugar. Turned out great!"
307214,53182,2008-03-05,4,These were good and did free up the oven but I still prefer them baked.
29410,47121,2005-10-20,5,"I tried this, also added parm to the bread crumbs, love the twist instead of just the same old chicken breast fried or put in soup.
next time I will use my george forman grilll"
108616,392121,2010-01-13,5,I made this bread last week-end after seeing the picture in the Southern Living magazine. It was delicious. My hubby and I ate a piece before it was cooled and ate some after cooling. I doubled the recipe and gave one loaf to my parents. My dad likes to heat a slice up for about 15 seconds in the microwave. I will definitely be making it again.
158086,185151,2011-11-09,5,Wonderful!  And so easy...I did add a little hoisen sauce as others did....great fast weeknight recipe...
253965,49534,2009-12-20,5,Super good snickerdoodles...just like my Nana makes!
158446,37926,2008-03-23,3,"This recipe sounded good when I read  it, but I was disappointed with the results.  It really lacked flavor, won't make this again."
114681,208595,2007-07-19,3,"These were good but I guess I wanted or expected more of a banana flavor.  I only used half the amount of chocolate chips, looked like a lot then, but they really overpowered everything.  I wasn't sure how to get in more banana without messing it all up so if I do this one again I may have to play with it.  Thanks NurseDi!"
2457569,548,2012-10-19,5,"Loved this!  I'm not a fish/seafood lover, but hubby is and I still loved it.  I cooked it on a cedar plank and it was terrific.  The only change I made was to take the marinade, add cornstarch, and cook in a small skillet to thicken.  Served this to pour over salmon at the table.  MMMM!"
449726,22868,2008-05-08,5,"I LOVE chicken cooked like this!!! When I make it, I don't think of the yogurt as just a marinade; I cook the chicken IN the yogurt ""sauce"" and serve it over rice. The ""sauce"" will separate during cooking and doesn't look pretty, but can be whisked before serving to make a smoother, more presentable sauce. I also like to add a can of sliced black olives and about a tablespoon of capers when I fix this. Served over or with rice or cous cous, with a great tossed green salad, it makes a wonderfully tasty and healthy meal. I also have found that non-fat plain yogurt actually works better than regular, which makes it healthier still."
1206650,222188,2011-05-31,5,"This recipe really is to die for. I was a little hesitant about the amount of sugar (even though I love my sweets) so I cut the amount down. The first time I think it was cut down too much because I could taste a lot of butter flavour so now when I make it, I taste test along the way so I don't add too much sugar. Have made this recipe multiple times and just forgot to review."
59064,42836,2003-01-11,4,"I enjoyed being able to use lemongrass and my Asian condiments.
Very nice recipe which gets to stay in my cookbook."
353394,158087,2009-07-01,3,the flavor is good but i don't like the texture w/ regular oatmeal.  will try using quick cooking or leftover instant next time.
89831,75772,2003-12-31,5,"Hi Myrna...tryed your cheddar Parmesan potatoes, they were a great sucess, everyone loved them, especially my DH, he loves potatoes in and shape size or form, and could probably eat them for a main dish ... the only thing I changed was, I added lots of minced fresh garlic in with the melted butter, we are big garlic lovers here, and put garlic on just about everything ...my DH even eats them raw,  also I added a bit more cheddar than the 4 ounces it called for, and doubled the recipe, as I was serving 8 people for dinner...This dish is simalar to scalloped potatoes, but mabey even better. Thanx for a great recipe...I will be making this again, soon :-)"
139381,203376,2007-07-24,0,"pattikay....I haven't made these as buscuits yet, but will do in the near future.  I grew up eating basically the same thing, but it was cooked as one large pan bread thing...not as bisquits.  Mom would make biscuit dough, flatten it out to fit the bottom of a cast iron skillet and cook on top of the stove just until it browned on each side.  As kids, we ate it with chocolate gravy or stirred up peanut butter and Grandma's molasses.  Delicious!  Can't wait to try the biscuits!  Thanks!"
2001938939,312954,2018-01-18,0,I just did this tonight - in the microwave :-) Pepperoni and sauce on one slice - a little sauce and a lot of cheese on the other :-) &lt;3
1446813,458408,2012-04-23,5,"Weekend Cooker, let me first start by saying thank you! I was looking for ideas for dinner and tried this, LOVED IT! Love it so much it is the only way to make a burger in my house! I usually add everything but the jalapeno for the kids then throw in a couple jalapenos (one seeded, one not). We loved the flavoring of the burgers but just wanted more spice.  I'm not sure about the mayo/ketchup mix, we've never done it."
298209,128769,2006-03-02,5,"Absolutely wonderful meatballs, taste even better when they cook longer.  My 3 year old son loves them, says they are better than mommy's hahahaha.  Again have eaten them after Dave cooked them.
Danielle"
246482,249520,2010-09-10,0,"This is a wonderful pickle, Crisp and very fresh tasting. We actually ate a huge jar one night at supper, we  just kept talking and taking a dill. I have to make more to keep us thru the winter. Id give it a 10 if I could."
237783,103965,2007-08-09,5,"This was a great time to find this wonderful recipe -- my tomatoes were ripe!  Even after they aren't in season, I'll be making this again and again  Thanks!"
305531,123118,2013-07-24,5,"Delish! Loved the flavors in this simple side dish. Thanks for sharing, Cookgirl. Made for ZWT9."
1715348,97498,2010-10-27,5,This was awesome! <br/><br/>I halved the recipe and used 6 cups of chicken broth and it came out thick & delicious. I also shredded the cubed pork after it had simmered for a couple of hours to make it more burrito friendly.<br/><br/>Excellent flavor!
607084,217139,2007-10-07,5,The bread was much better than any in the stores but we hate the tatse of ameranth.  I substitue teff for darker almost whole wheat type taste and garbanzo/fava flour for a white verision that are much less yeasty flavoured.  We also make it in a bread machine on gluten-free setting with a light crust and it works great.
341170,225291,2007-08-14,4,"Just loved it! I used 2 loaf pans as you suggested and it turned out great. I had to lower the time to 35 mins, but otherwise perfect. I used about 1/3 cup poppy seeds, but I think I'll try with the full 1/2 cup next time"
168921,72469,2005-10-23,4,"Definitely, use the syrup. This makes a very heavy, dense cake."
2000436832,28768,2015-08-28,5,"I used 28 oz crushed tomatoes, the chopped 6 fresh tomatoes, also added a can of tomato sauce. (We like ours more saucy),. Yum yum"
1588737,145478,2010-09-30,5,"Fantastic!  My husband loved these cookies.  I didn't have chocolate chips but had dark mint chocolate in my freezer so I chopped some up, threw it in and Viola! A Masterpiece!"
732614,42369,2008-11-22,5,I made these earlier today and I'm positive they will be on my cookie trays from now on. They are easy and oh my gosh good. I put wax paper on the bottom of my cookie sheet and they came right up.
1620730,353511,2010-06-10,4,"I used this recipe to make a un-cheese pizza and it was very tasty! Though the lemon flavor was very strong, so next time I'll try adding less to none. Overall it was a good recipe, and I'll probably change my star rating once I try adding less lemon juice. GOOD JOB!"
118585,88437,2005-11-23,5,Wonderful!
1445529,24154,2010-06-21,5,"I admit I was skeptical trying this recipe.  They turned out perfect!  Tasted just like a rich homemade dinner roll, in muffin form.  I will definetly use this recipe again and again, especially on busy days.  Loved this, shared it with my sister and mom, who are both avid bakers."
129201,247379,2008-08-05,5,"This soup couldn't have been easier, it had great flavour and was so low in fat that I didn't feel too guilty about adding a dollop of sour cream,  thanks Sazza!"
1048179,111169,2011-04-06,5,These are really good! The gouda is the perfect compliment. I fried the bacon separately because I like it really crispy and made a pan sauce from the chicken pan. Yummy!
289255,16746,2007-09-17,5,"Delicious! I used 1 T of ginger and decided that I wouldn't want to use more than that. I like cookies less sweet, so I didn't use any sugar to roll the cookies. Still these are plenty sweet.

If you put make one inch balls, you get nice little 1 1/2- 2 inch domes. They don't spread much, so you can put them fairly close on the pan.

These are great as chewy cookies. I baked them for 9 minutes... they looked done, but were still chewy inside. Wonderful hot!"
2000136307,213989,2015-04-12,5,Great source for variations of my favorite dressing. Bookmarked.
29655,228480,2010-05-04,4,"Great dish!  Even the picky eaters in the household enjoyed it.  The flavors work well together.  Next time I'll make an effort to not chop things too small.  I think that would aid the dish's appearance when finished.  This will go on my ""repeat performance"" list for its ease and ability to deliver veggies easily to the whole family.  Thanks for posting!"
468146,276064,2008-07-21,5,All I can say is WOW! Who would think that a bay lea could add such flavor. Since it was hot here I cooked them on my grill in my cast iron pan. I used garlic infused oive oil for a little more flavor and bc I like garlic. Made for Zaar's Chef Alphabet Soup Game. YUMMY!
133174,468518,2012-04-06,5,"DH paid this the highest complement by having a second helping.  Made this using 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 water while resisting the urge to add in chili flakes.  Again, I failed to read directions and chopped the onion and minced the garlic, thus leaving them in the finished product.  The sweet potatoes added a light sweetness.  Not having fresh parsley, the soup was garnished with additional cilantro when serving.  Made for Aussie Swap."
40404,105059,2005-09-05,3,This recipe has a wonderful fudge flavour but it's texture is more like a spreadable fudge than a frosting.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out quite gritty.  I think I might like this on a nice brownie but not on a cake.  I'm continuing my search for the perfect chocolate frosting...
114027,320588,2009-09-29,5,"MMMMMM! This was really great and so delicious :) I used to get fudge from the little fudge shops on the Jersey shore and this was defianatly similar. I think I stirred mine one too many times as it came out a little crumbly, but it was still perfectly edible LOL. Thanks for posting this recipe and I can't wait to try your other fudge recipes. Made for PAC Fall 09."
729254,49547,2009-02-14,5,"Great recipe, very spicy and flavorful! A good balance of sweet and spicy. I always try to reduce the fat in recpes so I eliminated the olive oil and cut down to 4 tblsp of sesame oil. This cuts out at least 400 calories. It came out really delicious and still very rich!"
130133,112641,2005-09-13,5,"I have a recipe very similar to this which I was going to add, but mine only adds 1 to 2 tsp of prepared mustard to this recipe and I only use 1 tbsp of vinegar.  I serve this dish with Boston Brown Bread.  It's one of my husband's favorite meals!"
169430,147441,2007-02-03,5,"A wonderful cup of lovin'. I made 2 cups last evening, one for me and one for hubby....then I made 2 more. Absolutely delicious, I skipped the whipped cream on mine but put in a splash of fat free evap milk. Dh and I were on the sofa discussing something and went upstairs with the 3rd cup each. I'm reviewing this the next morning. Love you mama for this heavenly Valentines (anytime) drink. It's smooth, rich and oh so yummy."
2690449,494865,2013-02-12,0,This is a great dish.  We are on the 17 day diet and this quick and easy recipe will be with us long after the diet is gone.
895132,506875,2014-04-19,5,"Made this with recipe #506872 and almond milk. So good, love the combination of spices! You absolutely need no sweetener, and with the coconut yoghurt it&#039;s a dream. Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;Made for Spring PAC 2014"
200270,30644,2007-07-23,5,"I feel a bit funny rating these, but I had so many comments on how lovely they were that I will. I added a tablespoon each of mayo, sour cream and ranch dressing. In lieu of the dry ranch dressing I used some taco seasoning.I had to leave out the red capsicum as one of the guests is allergic to them...and I completely forgot the onion!! but they were really great. I can see that I will be making these for lots of family get togethers. I used ham and corned beef slices."

738763,46967,2011-04-06,5,My family walked in the door and when they saw what we were having they couldn't wait for it to be done.  They all loved it!  I added in come black olives and gave it a go.  Delicious and easy to boot!
153866,76594,2004-09-12,4,This was very nice and quick and easy to do. The combination of ingredients go really well together. I loved the pecans in the mixture! 
1891691,20616,2013-03-17,5,Indeed there is a reason why its 5/5 stars. It is good. I don&#039;t understand the flour on top of the bread but then again I am 4th generation removed from Ireland! I only made 2 slight modifications; I boiled the raisins for a few minutes and I didn&#039;t have caraway seeds so I used just a splash of anise. I read online cumin can be mistaken as caraway in recipes but that is so wrong. After I searched the definition of caraway I found anise was the closest I had. (fwiw)
160977,25169,2008-06-08,5,"I love balsamic vinegar and was so happy to find this recipe. The first thing that drew me to it was the amount of oil. Mostly vinaigrettes have four parts of oil to one part vinegar (or lemon or whatever the ""sourness/acidity"" is). To my taste that is too oily. This was totally different. Very good taste, wonderful over my usual Sunday salad. Made exactly as stated, used 1/8 teaspoon and four turns of the pepper mill. There is more than enough left for our weekday salads. It says that the recipe yealds 2 servings, this might not be correct.........Thanks for posting. Made for Camera-Less chef Game #5, (June '08)."

651633,215414,2008-12-17,5,"This was so creamy, so rich, so good!!! My DH & I loved it, he got two BIG servings.  I used cream of mushroom soup and boiled the potatoes before for awhile, I only had to put it into the oven for 40 minutes.  Other than that I followed the recipe as is and I thought it tasted great the next day too.  Thanks for the great recipe."
104295,225645,2008-07-28,5,"Oh wow!  The only major change was I doubled the sauce.  I like my noodles to be really saucy and for us this was a must.  I did use dried cilantro, green pepper instead of red, and chunky peanut butter.  But all 4 of us loved them cold.  And this is going in as lunches for tomorrow.  A winner that I will make again.  Thanks!"
133174,69914,2012-04-13,5,"So simple and delicious.  I used frozen green beans and steamed them in a steamer basket for about 10 minutes then tossed with butter, seasoned with the salt and pepper.  Made for PAC Spring 2012."

392230,228474,2007-06-15,5,"Oh so good! My family absolutely LOVED these potatoes! I made them exactly as written, and they came out perfect! Incredibly delicious.I love using fresh rosemary to season potato  dishes, and this one perfected the combination! Thanks JulieB.! We will have this as a regular ""potato rotation"" in our line-up.! Made for Zaar World Tour."
197023,57167,2009-04-27,5,"For us a wonderful 5+++ dish. Just love mushrooms and artichokes! I made this without the rice as we enjoyed it with lazyme's yummy Recipe #191110.  As far as I'm aware, Mrs Dash seasoning isn't available here, so I added - after perusing several copycat recipes - a combination of herbs and spices that meet our taste preferences: basil, marjoram, oregano, thyme, rosemary, sage and cumin.  YUM!  I used probably double the mushrooms: a mix of shitake, Swiss browns and baby portabellos; and, of course, just had to increase the garlic - to three cloves.  Just loved the fact that this recipe already had wine in it.  I didn't need, therefore, to contrive a way of including it! ;)  A wonderfully delicious recipe, Kim127, which I know we'll enjoy again and again.  Thank you for sharing it!  Made for PRMR."
29300,25038,2005-05-26,5,"Very nice rich pie. Brought it to work for a potluck and everyone loved it including myself. My boyfriend also was pretty fond of the one that I had kept at home for him ;-) Great recipe. Thank you so much, Richard :-)"
1728148,248344,2011-03-14,0,Oh.... my god. This was so tasty. I agree with other people though in saying it did take quite a bit longer than 30 minutes. It was well worth it though. Plus i didn't have hoisin sauce. I used duck sauce instead.
490142,19259,2011-02-15,5,"These potatoes were the perfect addition to our Valentine's meal!  They were so rich and creamy - perfect with our prime rib! I did use skim milk, reduced fat sour cream and light butter, but you couldn't even tell!  Thanks for the great recipe, JoAnn!"
723134,229732,2008-05-31,2,"We like hummus, but not this salad.  We tried it after reading the previous reviews and thought it would be something different for a change of pace.  The taste was different alright.  Both my husband and I agreed that it was just okay and not something we'd make again."
924874,170502,2008-08-16,4,"I make this dish for almost every summer family event.  It tastes fresh and light (I use slightly less Miracle Whip and Italian dressing).
It's even a hit with those who normally wouldn't eat pasta salad."
29196,76942,2004-05-14,2,"We tried really hard to like these, but they just didn't hit the spot. In their favour, they were simple to make, but I found there was way too much sauce for 4 potatoes, and we didn't enjoy the texture of that sauce in our mouths. Although I was careful, I think it may have curdled a little-it was quite ""grainy"". Sorry marie."
839492,63846,2011-01-05,5,"I did not use the grated carrot, otherwise followed the recipe with the exception of adding a thin layer of sour cream to the inside of the tortilla prior to putting together. I like (if I don't have fresh corn) using canned no salt added vaccuum packed corn, it tastes the freshest and is slightly sweet too. Thanks for sharing!"
473079,183003,2007-03-28,5,"I have a 5 year old that got to decorate Valentines cookies for the first time last month!  This recipe is sooooo easy and sooooo good! I roll them a little thicker so they're a little softer.  
Thanks for the recipe!"
226863,455487,2011-09-20,5,"I used fresh black-eyed peas, and didn't add the extra water.  Mine didn't really want to stick together, but maybe it was because I didn't add water.  I just didn't want them to be runny.  The taste was fabulous!  I used a cherry-bomb red pepper.  A special treat for me!  Thanks for sharing!"
673444,10620,2009-09-08,4,I thought these were pretty good. They were good and spicy and easy to put together.  My bf's only complaint was that the beans made this difficult to eat. He finally settled on just picking it up and eating it versus trying to cut it with a knife and fork. I used fresh corn and cooked it for a bit with the onion.  This is something I would make again if I had an excess of bell peppers. Thank you.
169430,172830,2008-06-15,5,"I can't believe that I'm the first to try these wonderful cookies! Aside from using sliced almonds because I didn't have any whole ones I used Splenda for the sugar and just egg white for the egg. I made a 20 cookie amount and got 16. I guess that I could have cut them a touch thinner but I didn't want to, lol. These not to sweet cookies (if you want sweet cookies you'll need to add more sugar or Splenda) are hard to put down! I ate 2 just so that I could review them (yeah, right!) and it was hard not to grab 6 more. I used the min times given for both bakings and that worked perfectly for me. The small size will fit beautifully into my coffee cup :D. Made for ZWT4"
383346,183993,2008-09-14,4,I reduced the horseradish to 1 tbs.  Perfect.  I love smoked gouda so that's what I used.  And I'm glad I did.  The taste was yummy with that.  I'll add milk next time cause the texture was too thick.  Thanks Cooks4_6.  Made for Zaar Star Game.
1970951,67256,2011-07-30,5,Made this cake for my mom's birthday. Best banana cake I've ever tasted and very easy to make. Mine took about 1h and15minutes to cook (could just be my oven) but it was moist and delicious! Anyone concerned about it baking at such a low temperature - it works so don't let that discourage you from making it. You won't regret it! I will definitely be making it again.<br/><br/>Sidenote:I made sour milk instead of using buttermilk by adding a table spoon of lemon juice to 1 1/2 cup of skim milk and it turned out perfectly. I didn't have time to put it in the freezer as my family was patiently waiting it's arrival in their tummies but it was still very moist.
240668,37389,2006-09-02,4,"I had a lonely flour tortilla that was crying out for attention so I gave this recipe a try.  It was quick, easy, tasty, and filling.  Top it off with a glass of soy milk and you've got a great morning snack.  Thanks for sharing."
497100,21363,2007-05-17,2,"was too creamy for my taste, if i make it again ill only use a half of the cream cheese sour cream mix ..... my DD however loved it !"
1163303,37355,2010-06-07,5,"i was wondering, do you make the same recipe without the cabbage and carrot and can you use that to make hmong style stuffed chicken wings??? my grandma was the only person in our family who ever made them and she only made them for hmong og parties and she is getting along in her years and i wish i knew how to make them"
153067,197741,2006-12-29,3,"I did this recipe exactly as listed and my rice never cooked right.  Also, this recipe is SO super spicy...which would be great for those who like spice...it was extremely overpowering to me.  None of my family ate it, but that's just us.  If you like spicy, try it and put a review in, I'd like to know what others think.  Thank you for sharing.  LA :-)"
68460,70758,2003-09-28,5,"This is TOTAL comfort food!  I made this for lunch on a cold, rainy day and it really hit the spot.  I did add the miso and I'm glad of it because it really adds to this soup.  Thanks Sharon, I've been looking for a soup like this and I'll for sure be making this again!"
371738,17776,2011-05-21,5,"Reading the other reviews, I decided to cut down on the powdered sugar to 2 cups and it was PLENTY.  Next time I will use even less.  This was great, nonetheless.  It reminded us of cheesecake and in the future, I will top it with strawberry or cherry pie filling.  Thanks."
20754,39612,2002-09-24,5,"Lisa Pizza, this biscotti was very good.  What I did was when you put them in to bake the second time on the side I added 10 minutes, making it 25 minutes .  I also turned them over and baked another 25 minutes on the other side.  Came out crispy the way biscotti should be.  Thanks so much for this recipe ; )"
586751,63855,2007-11-08,5,Excellent! This is easy and great! Thanks for posting!!
693345,172858,2011-03-15,5,"This is delicious! The flavors all compliment each other very well. I cut the recipe down to two servings, and made this for myself for lunch today, and I had it with a couple slices of French bread. Now I have lunch tomorrow too! I used a white onion, which was perfect for me, because I don't really care for a strong onion flavor. However, I found myself ""seeking out"" the onion. It adds such a nice, needed crunch. I only used 1/8 cup extra virgin olive oil for the 2-serving recipe (half the amount called for). I feel any more than that, and it would have been too oily. I only buy tuna in water, so that's what I used, and I had to use dried parsley (I don't often keep fresh herbs around). This is definitely a keeper! I would definitely take this to a BBQ or a get-together as a nice change from a pasta salad. Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
424680,320535,2011-06-09,5,"I'm really not usually the one who does spareribs, & now in the past month I've already made 'em twice & have plans for doing 'em again before too long ~ Go figure! Anyway, working with your recipe was an absolute pleasure, & the rib-&-bean combo was wonderfully flavorful! It all took a bit of time to prepare, but as the 1st reviewer indicated, ""These are worth the wait!"" Will be doing this recipe again, for sure! Thanks for posting it! [Tagged & made in Please Review My Recipe]"
53448,398329,2011-04-21,5,"Great! Easy and very tasty. I doubled the recipe and made 4 balls of dough so my daughters and I were cutting, baking and frosting all day.  This is my permanent cut out cookie recipe. thank you!"
50509,195795,2010-12-30,4,"Apples and turkey go together so well. I made the salad and just threw it on top of some mixed greens - no alfalfa sprouts around. I had only dried rosemary, and I m sure the fresh would have been ever so  much  better. I think I will try some lovage with this, too. A little sharp counterpoint would work well with this."
430117,259798,2008-12-04,5,"This was so comforting!!
I have made just the vegies like that for dinner many times, but never put the meat with it.What a great idea to get it all done at once!!  I have also done somehting similar using potatoes, green beans, onion and the sausage and made it on the stove which the kids like also!!  Thank you for the new idea!!"
918392,79427,2008-08-10,5,"Cannot get Duncan Hines where I live, but used a different mix. It was delicious. I had a similar recipe clipping once, the choc-mayonnaise cake but lost it, so I was pleased to find this one! Thank you, AuntWoofieWoof!"
354413,86006,2007-03-07,5,"No one could believe these were baked.  Needed to bake them for about 20 minutes after the original 15 minutes, but they turned out nice and crisp outside and tender inside."
437904,51997,2013-07-26,5,"Everyone at my house loved this! I did sub splenda for the sugar in the mix and baked in a 9 inch spring form pan due to laziness. The result was what I would call a yummy, moist coffee cake. I used the entire amount of topping which made a nice crisp crust, might be even better with brown sugar instead of white."
269331,86307,2008-01-30,5,"Perfect As Is!!!  My DH kind of hemmed and hawed about having scallops, but when I said it was a Legal Seafood recipe his eyes light up.  10 thumbs up from both of us!!!!  PS. don't froget the lemon."
148316,22285,2005-05-16,5,"This was just the bomb! I doubled the recipe - except still used only the 1/4 cup sugar. This turned out so good - no one here had ever tried something like this before and it went so fast! I know for sure I'm going to make this recipe again, it was so delicious and I'm glad I found this recipe! Thank you for posting :)"
2420655,497236,2013-03-15,0,I love how creative this recipe is!  Great combination of textures and flavors!
319738,73469,2008-10-14,4,I really liked this recipe--but next time I might add pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and maybe some vanilla... And definitely some walnuts or pecans. I just think it needed a little more of something. But this is definitely a keeper! Thank you!  Update: I made this recipe again as 24 muffins with pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and the addition of 1 1/3 cups pecan chips and 2 tsp vanilla.  This is now my favorite fall breakfast!  Thank you again!
549669,57570,2009-12-02,5,Quick. Easy. Tasty.
482376,216378,2008-12-30,5,"This recipe made it into book#234156!
Oh my gosh, this is excellent bread!! It's healthy, too!! I'm so excited about this recipe. It's a must try. The bread had a lovely consistency, moist and dense on the inside and crusty on the outside. The flavor is just fantastic. I think it's best served warm (either straight from the oven or sliced and reheated in the microwave for 10 seconds) with a little bit of butter or honey. My whole family just loves this bread. It's already become a family favorite. Easy, too!"
117781,156101,2006-07-12,5,"This is very similar to my potato salad recipe, but BETTER. I like the addition of the dressings,  and I like that they are small amounts, just a hint is much better than entirely subbing the dressing for the mayo. I didn't have italian dressing, but I had italian dressing mix and used a teaspoon of that and added a little more mayo to compensate.  I have to add that what really makes a good potato salad is to dress the potatoes while they are WARM! Warm potatoes absorb the dressing and flavor better than cold potatoes, but hot potatoes would break the dressing. I used Wickles relish which is a combo sweet/sour relish...perfect!  I halved the recipe and used baby red potatoes since that is what I had on hand, I over estimated the qty though and didn't have enough dressing. It was still delicious, but needed a bit more salt.  This will be my new potato salad recipe, it is truly great! "
240449,139060,2007-06-26,5,"TRY THIS! And just put whatever you like in the quesadilla for example, cooked chicken, black olives, green onions, tomatos. We made ours on top of our pancake griddle so we could do two at a time.  I WONT need to eat at Applebee's EVER again!"
1248418,221248,2011-10-03,5,"Again Kittencal, you do not dissappoint. This was the best sausage casserole I have ever had. I have one I always used but this one was so incredible it will be my new go to. I actually used some things from 2 of your casseroles. I added dry mustard to this and I also had some bacon ends that I cut up and browned with the sausage. We don't like onions but we like the flavor so I used a small amount of dried chives. The crust was perfect. Thanks again, Kitten. Keep 'em coming!"
1195833,12316,2009-04-15,5,Excellent Choice and Recipe! This is a hit. Thanks so much!
369715,181188,2008-11-05,4,So easy to make. I followed the recipe as written other then mine only needed to cook for three hours on low. I topped this with some mexican blend cheese. Next time I will cut up the chicken into bit size pieces so the salsa draws through the chicken more.
835187,335466,2009-01-18,5,"So tasty and spicy! Next time I am going to cut up the vegetables into much smaller peices to make a smoother chilli that is easier to eat. This recipe has an unusual ingredients list, but tastes great! Thanks."
67656,234094,2007-07-30,5,Golly this was just sensational. Hard to imagine that a few simple ingredients became such a lovely dinner.  Trying to keep the calories down so I started the onions cooking in broth.  After cooking for 4 minutes I added the sesame oil but not the vegetable oil (one added flavor the other does not). Other wise made as directed.  Thanks KizziKate.
2828630,184977,2013-05-16,4,"I think this recipe is right on and definitely a great beginning to some excellent curry chicken.  Definitely restaurant quality.  I added bell pepper and onion to my version and some brown sugar.  I chose the optional ingredients as well, but I think I used a little more thyme in my version.  All in all this is the real deal.  Thank you Zula for sharing."
475149,218411,2007-08-15,5,"This is the BEST cookie I have tasted in a long time, and it was so easy. Thank you so much Courtly Scrock for posting. I am so in love with this cookie, and it has been added to my favourites. I used fresh rhubarb as I had just been given quite a bit, and the rest I froze so I will be baking this recipe again with the frozen rhubarb at another time. These had all of my all-time favourite ingredients - dried cranberries, white chocolate and rhubarb!! What a treat. Please try them - you will not be disappointed."
43083,159087,2010-04-11,5,This was very yummy! I used half/half because I had some I needed to use up which made this even better!
284897,463076,2011-09-17,5,"Simplicity at its best.<br/>I followed the recipe as written, but had smokey chilli flavoured ground pepper, which I used instead of normal ground pepper. This recipe is so very easy to make so very simple yet delicious. Sweet & tangy<br/>dressing.<br/>Something a little different and zesty to serve with salad. <br/>Thanks Jan."
777453,297882,2008-06-10,5,"This is THE one!! You don't know how many recipes i've tried in search of a healthier birthday cake for my sons first birthday! I've tried some stevia recipes and some from nourishing traditions, etc.. None were very good at all! This one is great! I used half organic whole wheat flour and half organic unbleached white flour, half rapadura (rapunzel) and half organic evaporated cane, natural cocoa, sea salt, aluminum free baking soda, and all other organic ingredients. I added one this- 1tsp chocolate extract.. WONDERFUL!! Havent made the icing yet thoguh.. THANKS so much for this recipe!"
174096,86202,2010-04-24,5,"Delicious, filling soup!  Nicely spiced, and I enjoyed the addition of corn and tomatoes, which is a twist I haven't had before in a white chili.  Thanks for sharing!"
211521,1005,2008-04-20,0,"OK.  The BEST sauce. Really great taste.  I have a good deep dish crust, but my sauce wasn't very good.  This one was very simple, cooked for about 15 minutes over med high, then finished over low.  Perfect."
37449,427442,2010-06-05,5,I really enjoyed this! I tried after about an hour and will be nibbling on them alot. Thanks! Made for the Looney Spoon Phoodies for ZWT#6.
199848,475815,2014-02-01,4,"This was a nice, different thing to do with hashbrowns.  I added onions when browning the meat.  I used a little extra sour cream, but the end result was still a little too dry, in my opinion; even with the water.  Next time I think I&#039;d assemble this a little differently and/or add or subtract some things.  Thanx for posting!"
127971,30601,2004-11-05,4,A friend gave me this recipe several years ago. I use chopped pecans or walnuts in cake & a lemon or orange juice powder sugar icing. My co workers devoured it.
128473,247306,2007-11-06,3,"Thanks for sharing your recipe Crab Cake Guy. I used Alaskan King Crab chunks for these crab cakes. They were  quick and easy to make and I followed the recipes exactly. The crab cakes were very tender and did not stay together well. I was very tempted to add more saltine crackers, but didn't.  On a personal note my dh & I found the old bay seasoning to be overpowering. I will try making these again with less old bay seasoning and more crackers."
97083,28649,2003-08-02,5,We make this fabulous dish with Queen Siam basil and green beans fresh from our garden.
705251,324478,2008-10-09,4,Very nice pumpkin cake recipe.  We loved the addition of the chocolate chips.  I'm not quite sure what you mean in step two as the ingredients do not include melted chocolate...so I just put all the batter with the chocolate chips into the bundt pan and baked it.  I did use almonds in place of the pecans as a family taste preference too.  Mine was finished in a little over an hour.  Nice a tasty treat that I expect to make again near the holidays.  Made for Fall PAC 2008.
53932,69155,2007-10-08,5,"I roasted these with another dish at 350 for about an hour--that's probably a little too long for those who don't enjoy well browned potatoes, but I loved them.  I used small fingerlings."
226863,347881,2012-10-20,5,"I made half the recipe and wish I'd made it all!  This is delicious.  Forgot to sprinkle the sesame seeds on for the pic, but did add them before eating. So good!  I will happily make this recipe again!"
374180,191429,2006-11-04,5,"This syrup was so easy to make, and it tastes fantastic.  This recipe is a keeper.  I did have to change pans after adding the baking soda to make room for the syrup to expand.  It is definitely worth dirtying the extra pan!"
133174,89447,2007-08-10,4,"This dessert can be made in a flash.  I usually cook rice and freeze in 1 cup packages.  One of those packages was defrosted and used to make this pudding.  The pudding took 2 minutes to whip together, the raisins were added along with 1/2 teaspoon Recipe #145505.  They were served about 30 minutes later, sprinkled lightly with cinnamon-sugar.  If I were to change anything, I might reduce the amount of raisins to 2/3 cup."
47559,181532,2009-02-11,5,"Because of the ingredients I had or didn't have on hand, I had to make a few changes, but it turned out delicious!  I used V-8 instead of the tomato juice and left out the green beans and zucchini.  I had some turkey Italian sausage (no prosciutto), so I browned the sausages and sliced them before adding.  I also used vermicelli instead of shell pasta.  Although it sounds like a lot of changes, I think the true character of the dish was still there.  We really enjoyed it on a blustery winter evening.  Made for photo tag."
297761,40621,2012-02-27,5,"I for one am happy to have found this recipe. Every year my DH goes to Canada and comes back with enormous lake trout -- which I personally don't care for (and I love fish). I've tried to cook this fish many different ways and I can hardly get myself to eat it...until now. I loved this recipe! I took many reviewers' advice and didn't add the extra water. As per their advice, I also added Old Bay, lemon zest and parsley. I served with tartar sauce or my old standby, mayo-n-yellow mustard mixed. Everyone loved these! Next time I will also try adding chopped green onion and some chopped red pepper for color. I do agree that for those who like a big BAM! of flavor, you will need to knock this up a notch or two, maybe add some more cayenne. When my kids came home while I was cooking these, they said, ""Yum! What are you making for dinner?! It smells really good!!"" Enough said. Thanks for posting!"
424680,449929,2011-04-09,5,"Very easy marinade to make & we thoroughly enjoyed it with the baked chicken breast this time around!

166642,253664,2008-06-20,5,I have never had a Pisco Sour before but I'm glad I tried this one. It was really good! Made for ZWT4 for the Tastebud Tickling Travellers.
440054,27121,2007-11-20,5,This was fabulous!  My guests loved it.  Thank you.
204024,427635,2010-06-14,5,"A little spicy for one of us, but that's not a flaw, really.  I made the mistake of using canned tomatoes and would definitely use only fresh in the future; but that affected the appearance of the dish more than the flavor. Loved the mouth feel of the sauce and couscous, which is something extremely simple but outside of our habit. Made for Zaar World Tour 6, on behalf of the Voracious Vagabonds."
296809,169739,2006-07-04,5,"This is an outstanding salad, Susie! The combo of flavors is a real palate-pleaser & the dressing is yummy. We paired it w/bruschetta for a lite meal & found it very satisfying. Thx for posting."
1803266837,184963,2014-10-26,0,Why are carrots and potatoes in the recipe photos but not in the ingredients?
50579,10318,2009-03-30,5,We really enjoyed this recipe.  I loved how the lasagna stayed together in squares when it was cut.  I've never made a lasagna before that stayed together so well.  I used sliced mozzarella for the layers and then shredded mozzarella for the top.  I did precook my noodles and baked it at 375 for 40 minutes.  We will defintely be having this again!
1105991,456517,2011-06-05,5,"Ok, this was surprisingly yummy!  But the recipe doesn't actually say what to do with the asparagus.  I think there's a step missing.  I diced it up in 1 inch pieces and mixed it in with the cream cheese mixture.  Even my little girl liked it!"
283251,117490,2007-12-12,3,What a great way to use up leftover chicken. Too easy. I burnt mine because I was trying to cook and chase a toddler at the same time! LOL. They were still yummy.
224235,29619,2005-10-16,5,"I had a hankering for an iced mocha latte down here in Florida and found this recipe to try. I prepared an envelope of mocha decaf capuccino according to the directions, then followed the recipe, cutting ingredients in half. This tasted wonderful and is going in my ""keeper"" file. Can't wait to share this with my Mom when she visits over the winter :<)"
51175,42635,2003-01-13,5,"I always thought that the only way a recipe could get 5 stars is if it tastes really great AND it's healthy or low fat.  This is the first one I have ever given 5 stars to!!!  Excellent!  Everyone keeps saying, ""These are low fat? No way!""  Be sure not to overcook these and they'll be soft and yummy."
50067,116377,2005-02-15,5,"This recipe is great being one recipe with 2 possible dishes. To save time I marinated the chicken then put the noodles to boil while I made the dressing. Instead of making large patties, I made little nuggets which cooked much faster, and I also put half the nuggets in the oven which came out perfect, and eliminated time spent frying. I cannot say which I liked better -soup or salad, which are both meals on their own, and the only change I made was to add the cashew into the salad rather than keep it only for garnish. And for the genuine Thai flavour I would definitly add the chilli in the patties"
91867,69821,2004-03-20,4,I love white chocolate.  You could put it on a boot and I would eat it.  That being said - this ice cream had a weird aftertaste - almost like a powder. I think that it had more to do with the white chocolate I used (Nestle morsels) then this recipe.  Good ice cream - but next time I will use a different brand of white chocolate.
124416,57666,2011-11-11,5,"A KEEPER!  Lots of flavor, not too spicy.  I browned the beef and onions, drained and put in crockpot.  Added the other ingredients along with cumin and parsley, added the cheese near the end.  It looked way too thick at the start but thinned out nicely.  And talk about easy!  Corn chips are a great topper.  Anita, many thanks for posting...Janet"
2000286851,405907,2015-06-21,3,The oven temp is way to hot for that amount of time. I&#039;d suggest with turning the temp down or shortening the cook time. Great flavor though.
177443,66757,2010-06-18,4,"Simple and good! I used at least a cup of fresh lemon verbena, and left my jar out in the sun for several hours. Loved the simplicity. Could also be left to steep overnight in the fridge. Thanks for sharing, Claire de Luna. Made for Magic of Herbs '10."
2250906,50639,2015-04-12,5,"I use this on everything from pork tenderloin to roasted veg, especially on the grill. Just made a new batch, and have been making the recipe for years! Adjust it the way you like,.make a half recipe first to try."
335157,375810,2009-06-08,5,"My husband loved these!  They were simple to make out of ingredients on hand (always a plus!) and tasted delicious. I did have leftover streusel  topping, but I saved it in the refrigerator for our next batch!"
464115,63639,2007-08-29,5,"This recipe was WONDERFUL!!!  I would give it 6 stars if I could!  It was flavorful, but not super-spicy, which is good!  My dad is on a low-carb diet and my sister is picky, but this suited both of them well!  The only changes I made were:  I used low-carb bbq sauce, and I cooked the peppers and onions in a little olive oil so that they wouldn't be as strong.  

I would highly reccomend this recipe!"
96177,336212,2009-04-17,5,"Yummmmmmm!! Made just as directed and we loved this delightful salad. I have always wanted to try raw broccoli and this was sure a hit. Made for holiday tag. Another keeper, weekend."
546010,255753,2012-11-26,5,Really a wonderful and easy salad I had some post holiday salad ingredients to use up. I used a red pear sliced thinly but that was the only substitution made. I drizzled on the EVOO and balsamic vinegar until it was just right. Thanks for posting Liza!
223854,404845,2011-07-12,0,"I had one kgs of small prawns/shrimps in the freezer and wanted to use them tonight. I searched for a prawn curry recipe and this is what brought me to your recipe.  I thought this recipe was really delicious, I followed the recipe except didn't add the jalapenos and red chilli's, so my 8 year old was able to eat it as well. Served it with steam rice.  Thank you GoldsmithLissa for your recipe."
2491885,144597,2016-12-14,0,These cookies are alot of work. They had a lovely texture but found that the layer with the crushed candy canes was the only layer that had real flavour. The other two layers had bland flavour. Nice looking cookies and crisp though.
352845,128952,2009-10-10,5,"In a word, awesome!  MY DSs love the Cold Stone version and couldn't wait to try this.  Needless to say they ate the whole batch and I was left scraping the bowl.  Thanks."
1581274,214791,2010-07-27,5,"This was a delicious recipe. I used chicken breasts and then marinated them over night. The flavor was soo good. Next time though, I think I will make a separate batch of the marinade and try reducing it so I can glaze the chickens as they cook."
491970,10155,2009-07-30,0,"I borrowed your technique, but switched up the recipe b/c we had no pineapple. I used a bottle of Coronia instead, and boiled for 2 hours, then broiled these in the oven with the BBQ sauce. They were so delicious and tender! 

Thanks for sharing this great idea!"
343160,118387,2011-05-09,5,Very good with fritos.
900992,69717,2010-01-08,4,"We had leftover cooked chicken, so I decided to try this recipe to get rid of it. It was good. It wasn't fabulous enough that I would plan to make it again in the absence of a need to get rid of cooked chicken, but it was good."
1102201,13162,2008-12-29,5,This recipe was great! I will make this a regular dish for the upcoming holidays.

250920,138306,2006-05-15,5,This was an excellent dish.  I think next time we will add corn to the mix for an extra vegetable and some sliced olives to top it off with at tht end when you put the sour cream on.
13483,49325,2008-07-20,1,This just did not work at all for me.  I took it to a potluch and came home with just about all of it!!!  I followed the directions as posted and it just went nowhere!!  The sausages could have been put to far better use!!  Sorry  paula&matt  but this was my experience with this dish.  I cannot make it again.
8688,47515,2004-06-09,5,"Very tasty shrimp, Bethany!  I used fresh garlic and 1 tsp kosher salt.  I bought my shrimp at Costco and it was very large.  I actually think a smaller shrimp would have been tastier in this recipe and I will try it next time.  I served this with an alfredo sauce over thin spaghetti with a tossed salad and crispy Italian rolls.  Delicious!"
621626,278221,2009-01-04,4,"I made this using 1 (14oz) can of diced tomatoes & 1 (8oz) can of tomato sauce (both with garlic basil, & oregano). I had to substitute half & half for the whipping cream since that is what I had on hand. I thought the taste was a little bland but adding grated parmesan cheese to the mix helped. Made for Zaar Stars"
219657,31036,2005-06-20,4,"High flavour!  Very refreshing for a hot summer day.  A little tart (which I like), but you must like rhubarb to enjoy.  I whipped the milk quite a bit more, so mine could have easily served 6-8."
13029,16110,2003-12-14,4,"Good recipe. I used half butter-flavored Crisco, half butter and 1 cup semi-sweet chips and 1 1/2 cups of butterscotch chips. Next time I will cut down on the sugar, as the butterscotch chips made these too sweet. The are light and have chewy centers and crisp edges."
582561,452531,2013-01-08,4,"We don't have Tilapia in NZ so I used John Dory fillets which might be too mild for the strong flavours of feta and garlic, though DH thought it was fabulous.  Personally I would leave the garlic out next time. There was one fillet left which DJH had cold for lunch and he declared it delicious this way too!!  Made for Aussie / Kiwi Swap Jan 2013."
158804,155604,2006-11-01,5,"I was intrigued with trying this recipe. I did have a few doubts when I was making it,but I wanted to try it so bad! I was worried that the flavors would fight each other because of the odd combination of ingredients. But I  Love it! I think it was missing a little something, maybe it needs a little fish sauce. I'm not sure, but otherwise it is an extreamly Tastey soup! You can't taste the coconut milk like I thought I would, it's just a nice smooth, creamy base :) I'm going to pass this recipe on as  my Absolute Favorite soup from now on!! Ten Stars!! Thank You, Kim127!"
387283,4799,2007-10-28,4,"Ive made this before, but forgot and put the 1 tablespoon of seasoning salt. Comes out very salty, I recommend starting with 1 tsp and stir and taste before adding any additional seasoning salt."
15521,117893,2006-12-29,5,"I thought this was excellent, and my family agreed.  I omitted the red onion and the wasabi, and replaced it with avocado cubes.  I added this individually so it wouldn't become mashed up along with the salad.  This was just my personal preference.  Next time I might throw in some smoked salmon.  I'll definitely make it again."
228032,99476,2009-02-10,5,"This was really good! I usually spend $1.25/pack of the Sun-Bird Beef and Broccoli mix and I use 2 at a time so this obviously saves me money. I thought it was a little salty  but I actually like that =/ it may be because I dbld up the sauce.
All in all, it was a success in my home and this is the way we will be preparing Beef and Broc from now on. Thank you!"
1656771,222576,2010-12-02,5,Great for my chicken!  Thanks.
2430064,497261,2013-03-16,5,did i tell u how beautiful this is? because it won&#039;t let me rate I&#039;m guessing this was so good I came back twice...back again and was able to rate! WOW I want this!
1900559,102617,2015-06-02,5,"If you like this, just add some chunks of canned pineapple and a little pineapple juice to the dressing.  This will make it addictive."
97579,53878,2008-03-02,5,I made these last night for a euchre party and they were a hit.  I love how easy and quick they were to make.  Thanks!
265694,203919,2010-01-05,5,"can't believe i didn't rate this. everyone loved this, even the kids. had to search for it all over again since i never rated and i didn't save it. am definitely making this again. thanks so much for sharing!"
1533,24415,2002-07-28,5,"Well I made one mistake, this was the only recipe I didn't double. Everyone voted to give it 10 stars LOL. It was easy to make and went quickly. 
For the 2 of use I will cut the recipe in half and serve with everything lol it was marvelous.
Ty Bergy another keeper."
590105,172461,2008-06-06,4,This was good.  I really liked the artichokes and the best part was how quickly the dish went together!  Reviewed for ZWT4
180898,97245,2005-01-25,5,"We enjoyed this so much. I did change it a little. I had shoulder chops with the bone. They were kinda thin. I decided not to skewer them but just marinated them in the marinade. I then grilled them to slightly less than medium rare. The marinade was perfect and the meat was tender and wonderfully flavored by the charcoal. I plan to make this whenever lamb goes on sale :-) Thank you for a great recipe.  Oh, I served this with grilled veggies and rice. "
486718,101187,2010-02-14,5,This was really good but I made a couple of changes.  I used refried beans mixed with some salsa and spread that over the crust before adding the meat.  Thanks!!
186273,36984,2012-10-10,5,Excellent recipe! Just like my Mom used to make. Recommend it highly!  I would scale back the salt a little bit (maybe to 1/2 or 3/4 teaspoon) - you can add more later to taste.  Even a little salty it was still a 5 star recipe.
890908,1106,2013-09-27,5,"these came out completely flat for me, because i was out of butter and used &quot;smart balance&quot; margerine - not at all baking safe. Nevertheless, they tasted so amazing that I scraped them all off the cookie sheet and ate them like cereal. Will make again soon, (with BUTTER, of course;  and with the raisins)."
51931,139857,2006-04-26,5,"Very delicious!  It tastes almost exactly like my recipe.  I used hot and sweet sausage like I always do. I never cooked with Fennel Root before so I was expecting it to taste like fennel seasoning.  Therefore, I didn't use the whole bulb b/c I don't really care for fennel.  WOW!  I wish I had used the whole bulb.  It was actually different tasting from what I expected (a bit on the sweet side and more like an onion) and it was delicious!  Instead of canned tomatoes, I used a fresh tomato and cut it up in cubes. My recipe doesn't call for pasta so this was a nice addition (who would have thought).  I also wish I had used more fresh basil on top.  It gave it such a nice flavor.  Sitting here at my desk eating the leftovers.  My boss walked by and said, ""Yum, something smells really good.""  I think I'll be making my sausage and peppers this way from now on."
306193,42272,2010-04-19,4,"Used London Broil, or what ever iwason sale.  Froze the meat for a few hours so it was easier to slice.  My husband thought the Worcestershire sauce was a bit overpowering."
2001494349,278233,2017-04-17,5,"I did a vegan graham cracker crust. It turned out amazing! Took it to a party and it was all gone quickly. I prefer the tofu method to the cashews. so many vegan recipes use cashews, but I find the results kind of heavy. This pie was perfect"
125640,106251,2008-01-25,5,"Very easy and very yummy. I used oregano rather than rosemary and added a pinch of hot pepper flakes to make it go a little better with my main course. Tasted great, but DH thought it needed something green mixed in to contrast, so will try adding asparagus tips or zucchini next time. Thanks for sharing."
1122161,14569,2009-07-13,5,"This pie was delicious! I used a pint and a half of strawberrys because I accidentaly bought too much, and I used a reviewers suggestion of putting 4oz cream cheese mixed with 4 Tblsp powdered suger spread on the bottom. Other than that made exactly as written and it turned out great! Thanks for posting!"
296729,40752,2009-04-26,5,Love this!  It is also great on baked salmon fillets!
356784,86623,2007-12-10,5,Love this recipe. Just takes time but is well worth it.
302094,44058,2006-09-13,2,I made this yesterday and had a jar for dinner. The only one who liked it was my 3 year old. Everyone said it was too salty. I followed the recipe exactly but I pressure canned mine. I also used tomato juice versus tomato's. My friend told me that baking soda is salty  so next time I  will not add the baking soda to see if it makes a difference. 
870928,145064,2009-11-30,5,"Loved this gravy! Used 4 cups of turkey drippings, cut down the butter to half the amount and still was very tasty. Mine also took longer than 3 minutes to thicken up, but turned out nice in the end."
115634,304768,2008-10-05,3,"First of all, I will try this receipe again!  I used what I had available, so not as written (subbed soymilk for nonfat milk, diced regular mushrooms instead of brown button, and 4 oz shredded mozzarella instead of 2 oz cheddar).  The recipe didn't make enough sauce to cover the layers which resulted in the lasagna noodles not getting wet enough to cook all the way.  As I made it, it was kind of bland, may have been a lot better with the cheddar instead.  I'll make it again, but double the sauce recipe.  As an additional note, I got 6 servings out if instead of 4 (made it in a 13""x9"" pan which it filled to the top)."
130531,241516,2008-04-14,5,"I made this for dinner tonight....it is delicious.  I definitely will make it again as we eat lots of shrimp and I like to find a variety of recipes. 
There is one thing I would like to remind everyone....I forgot to add the chopped green onions when I served this. I was enjoying the dish when I remembered, so added them to my serving...I couldn't believe the depth of flavor they added to the dish. I  didn't think a garnish would make that much difference...but I was sure wrong.!!
Thanks for a new and flavorful recipe......and especially one that was so easy to prepare.   Donna"
1375219,24911,2009-09-05,0,"Simply amazing!!! It tastes like the filling in a pumpkin pie and my husband agreed.  This is so good and for a gluten-free dessert, here is how I adapted the recipe:
Only use 1/4 cup of light brown sugar.  Just use 3 eggs.  I omitted the butter.   I dumped all of the ingredients into my food processor and blended till smooth.  I just used butter to grease the pie plate where I put the mixture and baked for 50 minutes.  If you are an ex-pat living overseas and cannot get pumpkin pie, this recipe is the pie filling for you.  Seriously yummy!"
320714,145147,2008-12-29,5,"Simply delicious, very healthy alternative to butter, milk and sour cream.
I will admit though, that I added a tiny bit of garlic plus seasoning to spice it up a bit."
88338,52206,2003-06-01,5,"This is fabulous and easy.  To lighten it up even more, I used ""Smart Balance Light"" instead of butter and it was still great.  I used real sugar.  I'm going to try 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Splenda next time!"
138435,86067,2009-04-04,5,"Yummy!  Easy to make and really tasty side dish.  I served this as a salad alongside a bowl of soup.  Made a great dinner.  I used grape tomatoes and they were very flavorful.  I will try this again in the summer with garden tomatoes, I can hardly wait!"
498271,388822,2013-04-30,5,"This is a great and tasty soup!  Love the roasting of the poblano, onion and garlic - I think it really added a lot to the flavor.  I used Mexican oregano instead of the epazote.  The chili powder (mine was hot) and squeeze of lime were a great finishing touch for the soup.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
41984,457760,2014-02-04,5,"I added one cup of semi sweet chocolate chips to the dough and omitted the chopped peanuts (the person I made these for doesn&#039;t like peanuts but likes peanut butter - go figure!).  I chopped thin pretzel sticks for the recipe.  Pretzel pieces flew everywhere.  My dog was happy and thirsty by the time I was done chopping the pretzels.  I used my small scoop and made at least 5 dozen cookies.  The first batch looked like cookie balls because they didn&#039;t flatten out during baking.  After the first batch, I flattened each cookie dough ball before I baked them.  I heard that the cookies were a huge hit on the job site.  I personally prefer crisp cookies and thought that if the cookies were soft, they&#039;d soften the pretzel pieces.  I baked the cookies for about 18 minutes.  I will definitely make these again.  Maybe next time I&#039;ll drizzle some chocolate on them after they&#039;ve cooled down instead of putting chocolate chips in the dough.  Thank you for posting this recipe!"
389284,53182,2007-01-24,0,"I haven't tried this yet, but what a great idea!!!  I love baked potatoes, but often times I don't make them due to the time it takes to bake them in the oven.  Now they'll be waiting when I arrive home from work.  Thank you for posting!!"
1801484264,181230,2015-03-17,5,"Terrific.  Made as written, family devoured it!"
170386,89132,2007-11-01,5,This was very good! The liquid smoke really added to the taste. We will make this again for the holidays (and other times too).
1198491,175669,2009-11-22,5,"delicious and a great way to add veggies to your kids' meal!  I pretty much doubled the recipe and used a full box of recipe-ready lasagna noodles.  I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese because it's what I had and used extra sauce.  By doubling the recipe, it needed extra oven time, approx. 45-50 mins total."
511661,248854,2009-06-16,5,"Very traditional - I wonder if the name is from this origianlly being 'possum' stew, as the ingredients are pretty standard for southern mountain stew with whatever 'varmint' was caught that night..."
4439,62513,2004-09-05,5,"wow, wow, wow, spinach and pine nuts and feta together, what a combination!! of course, I used whole wheat pasta and it was so so so delicious!!!!!!!!"
2002085336,293890,2018-03-30,4,"It looks absolutely marvelous! Can't wait to cut into it. I baked 45 minutes, but the cheese still appeared runny, so I put back for another 15. Could not purchase a cheese babka anywhere around here, so had to try this."
164610,58347,2007-08-22,4,"I haven't made this full recipe yet, but I'm rating this for the 'brown sauce' part of the recipe only.  I needed a chinese brown sauce racipe for this recipe I was trying out from a box of instant rice.  Most chinese brown sauce recipes I found used beef broth which I really can't eat.  I followed this recipe's sauce ingreds using 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, and the soy sauce and brown sugar amounts, but only used 1 cup of chicken broth and just under a tbsp of cornstarch, mixing all together in a saucepan and cooking on medium for maybe 20 mins or so until thickened.  I refrigerated the leftover sauce and used it again for another stir fry. It was great!  I made more because I wasn't sure if I needed more than I had left from before, but I didn't need any extra so I'll be saving the sauce I made fresh for another time.  Thanks very much AudreyBG!  Hope to try this full recipe sometime soon! :)"
1406074,153291,2010-07-01,5,"Our kids favorite! Always a hit and never any left over. You need to make the night before so that the oreos have time to soften,  otherwise they are still crunchy which we don't care for. I also cut down on the milk to about 1 cup otherwise it seems to be too runny."
199848,159901,2010-08-14,5,"Yummmmmmy!   I especially loved that horseradish sauce....it's the perfect sauce for fried green tomatoes.  I did some extra horseradish, just because I love it.  It's very important not to raise the heat above medium high, or the butter will begin to brown/burn.  If you have green tomatoes in your garden, treat yourself to this!  Thanx!"
1405608,219439,2011-07-18,4,"apparently some people don't know how to convert so here's the recipe simplified...<br/><br/>2 cups flour<br/>4 tsp baking powder<br/>6 tsp sugar<br/>1 tsp salt<br/>3 tbsp   1 tsp margarine<br/>a little under a cup of milk<br/><br/>i used substituted vegan ingredients where needed. these were good to satisfy my morning craving quickly but they aren't very gooey and hearty. it's more of a cinnamon biscuit, but still delicious. :)"
46545,20860,2002-07-26,4,"This was very good. I like that it has some nutritional value from the peanut butter and cornflakes.   I used only 1/2 the sugar, and it was still very sweet, next time I'll try even less.  Also, used 1/2 a bag of choc. chips and the kids thought it was chocolatey enough.  Hated mixing the peanut mixture with the flakes (have to be quick & thorough)  but the rest was super easy!  Thankyou for a good snack!!!"
2002258744,145038,2018-08-27,1,Maybe I needed to cook it longer....but it was basically chicken legs in a watery sauce that didn't even stick to the legs (followed the recipe exactly). Not good.
228458,246295,2008-05-01,5,"This was so easy, and so much fun! I've never made my own cheese before, and the flavor of this stuff was terrific. I learned the hard way, though, not to use skim milk (all I had)--2 pints milk only yielded about 1/2 c cheese. Disappointing, yes, but my own dumb fault for trying to bleed a turnip LOL! Also, I used lemon juice in lieu of vinegar and it worked fine. Thanks for posting this--it is going to be fun to use in recipes and even to flavor for eating on its own!"
628753,41156,2009-01-04,5,This is AWESOME. We make the shortbread and strawberries. My husband was hesitant because it was not angel food cake. DO IT. This is a great desert for company.
93997,27797,2008-01-31,5,"Although my family did not care for these much, I really enjoyed them and would make them again. I mixed up the spices with cold butter that morning and kept it in the fridge to let the flavors blend. That evening, I melted the butter in the microwave and dipped the biscuit halves in the mix. I did not have parsley or dill so I used 1 Tbs. of dry italian seasoning. I used garlic powder and onion powder to equal the tablespoon. I will probably cut back the butter to about 1/4 to 1/3 cup next time. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!"
1802939187,116118,2014-07-17,0,Worst recipe ever! I&#039;m being serious! I tried this TWICE and it was severely screwed up. The directions are totally wrong. I added exactly what it said and it didn&#039;t turn out to ANYTHING! The dough was all crumbly and it was impossible to mix! I love cookies. I have tried all sorts of recipes that turned out amazing. But this is the worst. I don&#039;t kow who made this but it is entirely wrong! Do not use this recipe!
45162,17745,2003-10-27,2,"I followed this recipe exactly and ended up with chicken that was under done and orzo that was overcooked. The chicken didn't completely poach in the broth and I ended up taking it out, sauteing it and putting it back into the finished dish. Maybe my chicken pieces were too big."
772912,336466,2009-02-05,4,"Very good! I saw Paula make this on TV the other day and searched especially for this recipe. I was so glad that someone had posted it. I made a few changes, however. I used country ribs instead of baby backs, used chicken stock instead of water and didn't sear the ribs. I threw everything in the crock pot and cooked on low for about 10 hours. The ribs were packed with flavor and falling apart. Thanks so much."
437727,367227,2014-09-24,0,Didn&#039;t have olives...they would&#039;ve taken this to SIX stars!! Easy and fabulous!
88099,235218,2007-10-05,5,"These are very very good.  My store was out of bean sprouts so left them out and could not find the vermicelli rice noodles so I used Maifun rice sticks which I really like and they worked well for this recipe.  The flour and water seal was excellent.  I only had 1 roll unfold, which is good for me.  I think I would increase some of the oyster sauce and soy sauce next time because we could barely taste it.  We will be making these again for sure.  thanks so much for posting.  Made for PAC Fall 2007"
1675817,66414,2013-06-06,5,never brined before WOW thanks for the recipe
1530179,294532,2012-06-03,5,"I personally don't like jello shots, but they were popular at the party they were served at. I would definitely make them again. Also, the fruit wedge presentation is just beautiful. Each batch filled 4 orange halves and 1 lemon or lime. It's very easy to do, cut fruit in half, hollow out and place in muffin tins to hold stable, pat down rind, fill to brim with jello (shrinks while gels a little). Once firm (6 or so hour later) place flat side down on cutting board and slice orange halves into 4 slices."
80353,384521,2014-08-08,5,"Oh I wish I&#039;d made a double batch cause these didn&#039;t even make it to the table for lunch - as soon as they came out of the oven, the family stood around with butter knives in hand and ate the there and then (OK, we&#039;d just recently got back from the beach so everyone was HUNGRY).  I think the green onion and parmesan gave a really good boost to what is a classic biscuit.  These were crisp on the outside, tender on the inside."
103809,516126,2015-03-28,5,"I love this.  It&#039;s easy to assemble the packets, is really delicious, and easy to clean up.  I like to serve it with broccoli and maybe some heated french bread with butter."
157080,131229,2006-08-19,5,Really great and easy to make.  A very impressive recipe. Thank you so much for sharing it.
621831,191532,2008-02-09,5,i have tried other recipes but others are to confusing
2585084,501172,2013-06-21,2,"It didn&#039;t dawn on me that the ingredients list was missing the flour until I put it in the oven.  I let it bake anyway.  It came out with a saucy texture.  I loved it on ice cream.  I suggest that It be re-submitted as an ice cream sauce.  it was incredible over vanilla ice cream.  I hid in the back of the refrigerator so I could keep it to myself.  If this were an ice cream topping, I&#039;d give it five stars."
4399,7968,2001-01-08,4,"I found this recipe to be very good, but only gave it four stars as it called for (in my opinion) way too much celery and onions.  I cut the onions back to 1/2 cup and the celery to 1 cup.  I also added 1/3 cup grated carrots. My husband loved it!"
169796,35933,2008-07-31,5,"I make this to take to office parties.  It is one of the first thing people head for, and several people have threatened to eat the entire thing!  It`s a huge hit!  Thanks for sharing.  I LOVE IT!"
39301,15865,2009-01-28,5,"These were fantastic!!  Thanks so much for posting because the whole family loved them.  I simplified for the kids and mixed the chicken with shredded lettuce.  That way they could eat the dish ""taco salad style.""  Thanks for this keeper - we will be enjoying it regularly."
67728,304533,2010-06-02,5,"Such great flavor for such simple ingredients! So easy to make, too. I thought I was all done making recipes for this region of ZWT6, but then I came across Deantini's review of these with Recipe#360125, and I just couldn't pass them up, lol! I served these with the steak as well, and Recipe#124336. Perfect combo for a great ""steakhouse night"" meal. I'll definitely be doing these potatoes again, since I bet they'd be perfect with just about any grilled meats. Thanks for posting :)! Made for The Queens of Quisine for ZWT6 Germany."
1398976,139273,2009-11-05,5,This was my first roast I've ever made and it was very good! I forgot the worcestershire sauce and I didn't add cabbage but I did add garlic and celery. The left over juices made a delicious gravy. Thank you for the recipe!
942456,414514,2010-08-21,5,I really enjoy this recipe. I've made it twice now. The first time we made sandwiches of it and the second time we made as instructed. Both times were delicious. I used chili powder as I didn't have chipotle powder but it still was very good.
267283,107997,2007-06-27,5,"We had this a couple of weeks ago and it was so good. We love anything with red pepper flakes, so this was a definite must try. VERY, VERY GOOD. I am making it again tonight!"
375681,221405,2007-04-11,5,This is my favorite fruit salad!  This recipe is just a microwave version of the one I use!  Can't wait to try it!
2775428,137580,2013-04-08,5,I love it! I mixed in Bailey&#039;s with Kalhua and it turned out absolutely lovely!
28636,52283,2008-02-04,5,"These are great fun for the kids to make - and eat.  We too like to do them for various holidays (St. Patrick's Day, Halloween, etc.)  with the sprinkles to match.  Thanks for the great ideas for additional ""sprinkles"" - the Butterfingers were exceptional!  Thanks for posting!!"
293757,14296,2009-03-04,4,"Great post....made a few alterations as that is just what I do, but this dish made for a great meal..thnx 4 the post"
40525,23409,2005-01-12,4,"This tastes similar to other soups I've tried. Not bad, but not outstanding. A good basic recipe. Next time I'll probably up the vinegar and the spices.
"
33159,280280,2008-12-26,4,Very good & interesting salad!  I left out the red onion as a personal preference.  Loved the flavour combination but thought the sugar could be cut back quite a bit.
280394,26110,2009-06-02,0,"I have been making these for my family for a few months. I make two batches in the food processor and then press, cut and bake them. I use half white whole wheat flour. They always turn out great. Thanks for a wonderful recipe."
98919,360988,2016-03-12,5,"I started out looking for a true authentic Irish soda bread for an upcoming St. Patrick&#039;s day party but after much research on it, I opted to try this recipe instead....something I thought everyone would enjoy and eat. This was very moist and delicious! Made as directed except no caraway seeds even though I would love to try it that way once. The fact that this came from a true Irish grandmother is authentic enough for me! Thanks for sharing!"
322381,310707,2009-04-14,4,"I had seen this when Giada did it on her show, and was so happy to find it posted here. It's so delicious and creamy and sweet and savory. Nobody would not like this. I followed the recipe exactly as is and it was perfect. I urge everyone to try this recipe and enjoy!!"
134875,32844,2004-10-01,5,"Boy did this dish go quick!  Totally scrumptious, what great comfort food!  Talk about easy to prepare, it doesn't get any simpler.  I did not have a 14.5 oz can of plum tomatoes so I substitued one 10.5 can of Rotel with green chiles.  Came out fabulous.  Thanks for sharing!"
689367,374905,2009-06-10,5,"The whole family loved this one. I added two cubed chicken breasts to the spinach mixture. I also added the remaining one cup of whipping cream (From a quart) to the sauce and used two 13"" x 9"" pans, making 16 enchiladas. On the plate I poured some home made salsa verde on top of each one made with roasted poblano and jalapeno peppers, roasted tomatillos, onion, garlic, S&P, and cilantro. I will definitely make these again."
2001181842,301754,2017-03-16,3,"I'm trying to learn to love my slow cooker. With that said, this would have been better if I had saut&eacute;ed the onions in butter first. At which point, I could have cooked it on the stove in less than an hour. Also, that's WAY too much salt. I cut it back by a teaspoon, and it was right on the edge. My husband thought that something was missing. We both added lots more pepper. I only used 5 potatoes, and the consistency was fine--not a big fan of really thick soup."
1800199924,443758,2013-11-06,5,This was absolutely delicious! Definitely keeping this one!
42231,9970,2007-03-19,5,"Delicous...used manicotti shells, my grocer did not carry the large shells - so I made about 12 stuffed manicotti.  Used all the frozen spinach, 1 c. ricotta, 1 c. mozzarella, and 1 c. cheddar, oops.. and forgot the eggs.  My husband liked it.  Will make it again, very simple to prepare.  Thanks for this one!!"
154335,133448,2007-10-03,5,"Wow, I can't believe how good these were!! So simple but so good! I actually found (for myself) that if you cook 2 pkgs. of noodles but only add one seasoning packet it comes out perfect!"
353579,121490,2008-02-15,4,"I'll chime in with the rest on this one - very nice bread, sweet and moist - a great way to use some strawberries that might be a bit past their prime.  Thanks for posting!"
437767,110078,2009-04-27,4,"Beware the bone-in pork chop!  The meat really does fall off the bone on this one and the bones on pork chops splinter apart, making for quite an adventure in getting the bone shards out.  However, the flavor was GREAT and we're keeping this one...left out the water and will use boneless from now on, but otherwise exactly as written. 
Thanks!"
160577,202573,2007-09-08,5,"I make this dish all the time.  My husband grew up on it and I always have the ingredients on hand.  This recipe is how I make mine. I use chicken broth or bullion too, I don't recomond water. I don't always use cumin, sometimes curry some times arabic 7 spice blend...it all works just fine.  I also saute my onions in butter not olive oil and we serve it with yogurt on top, or sour cream if we're out of yogurt.  Great dish!  Super cheap, healthy and delicious."
166642,265329,2008-02-27,5,"These are great. They are easy to make and a great fix when you are craving Mexican. My family loved it and I will make this again, especially for get-togethers. Thanks for sharing!"
2633083,196087,2013-01-30,0,Fan Frigging Tastic  !!!!
588863,60160,2009-05-18,5,Thanks for this recipe. It's like an old southern scalloped potato recipe  I ate as a child. Some of us remember eating wonderful scalloped potatoes long before cheese and garlic were added to southern recipes.
165217,97692,2011-03-22,0,"This recipe was created by Todd Wilbur. It is published in his book entitled ""Even More Top Secret Recipes"". www.topsecretrecipes.com"
58104,146732,2006-01-23,5,"I use a 15 ounce can of pumpkin, omitted the sour cream because I just didn`t want the extra fat. And didn`t miss it! I added hot pepper flakes and fresh minced sage. Garnished with diced red onions and cheese. It served 3 but thats because 
my son ate most of it. I was expecting leftovers I guess I was kidding myself. This really should serve 4-6 as the recipe states. Thanks for fillg up my sons belly!"
133547,495291,2013-06-15,5,AWESOME!!! I made this for Father&#039;s Day Dinner and it was a huge hit. I did use only half the adobo seasoning as it 4 TBSP would have made it way too salty for us. Otherwise made exactly as written. I will definitely be making this again and again. Thank you for sharing :)
50888,54918,2003-03-07,5,"Great recipe. The chicken was juicy and tender. I brined for 3 hours. I premade a day ahead and rewarmed at 375F for 20 minutes (with no foil cover). It was wonderful. I added sauted garlic and onion to the ricotta filling and eliminated the red pepper flakes. If you use ""seasoned"" bread crumbs, go easy on the salt in the flour. Thanks Steve."
1066371,22691,2018-06-27,4,Itâs a really good recipe. The topping was perfect and needed no changes. I did make a couple of minor changes but all in all this is my go to recipe. I added six cups of fruit instead of three because I like a lot of fruit. I used the mixed berries from Costco. I added three tablespoons of corn starch to the sugar mixture and then mixed it into the fruit. I like a thicker syrup for a cobbler rather than a juice.
953275,353848,2011-07-06,5,"Delicious use for my unending supply of fresh rhubarb.  It was quick to make and had really nice flavour.  I ran into problem with the pan size too, calling it a ""crumble"" I pictured it in more of a casserole dish, spooned out with ice cream.  I also wanted to be able to bake it in a countertop (toaster) oven to save turning on my regular oven.  So the bottom layer was mushy, as you might expect, but not necessarily in a bad way, everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I will try again using a cookie sheet as the recipe calls for, and if it turns out more like a bar than a crumble, that'll be OK because it will still taste great."
189322,169727,2009-07-01,4,"We really like this recipe!  I have fixed it several times.  I change the sharp cheddar to mild cheddar, but otherwise fix it as is. I also bake it on a broiler pan so the juices drip through. I found that helps alot!"
2001760982,239454,2017-10-21,5,I've been making this for years using the jarred cherries from Trader Joes.
143318,445374,2013-07-21,4,Very good combination of ingredients. I used fewer chia seeds. The cheese and almonds make this a filling vegetarian meal.
653438,448205,2011-02-23,5,Made this for New Kids on the Block tag game and plan to use some in our meal today.  Followed the instructions which are soooo easy.  I know this will come in handy.
600011,113525,2007-10-02,4,"I made this for my family this summer down in Hatteras NC. Very easy and since we like to take things up a notch>>>>That was possible with this recipe. I think I will use less cracker crumbs then next time. There are far too many beautiful & delicate flavors dancing in this dish to cover it all up with ""Ritz"". Over all, a definite keeper!!!!"
414969,29494,2007-12-29,4,"tasty and tender.  omitted onions, salt, pepper.  added rosemary and carrots.  used cream of mushroom and 2 cans of evap milk.  Great flavor!!  served with sugar butter acorn squash."
50858,28978,2002-10-02,5,"Okay, I've now made a convert of my b/f who loves everything I've made from the 'Zaar.  We made this for dinner the other night and really liked it!  I'm afraid that with the side dishes I was making and everything coming to a head at one time, I didn't exactly measure the sherry - so sue me - but it came out perfectly, anyway.  We had it with brown rice and the combination of flavors was yummy.  Thanks for the great new favorite!"
1239819,304975,2009-04-15,4,This dessert was easy to make and tasted great! I used homemade whipped cream instead of Cool Whip. The fudge sauce is very good!
804851,29857,2008-10-02,5,"I used silken tofu in place of the sour cream with excellent results.  Why not make it better for you when you can right?  So delicious with a dollop of whip cream.  Everyone was raving how much they loved this pie Karen!  I am going to make it for Christmas, as it was so well received this time around!"
162826,194347,2008-03-30,5,What an easy and tasty dish. Only changes I made --added some sliced ripe olives and more cheese. THX for posting!
362213,103137,2009-05-16,5,"Great recipe! These are probably the simplest, quickest cookies I've ever made, and really tasty. I used dried cherries, and substituted chocolate chips for the nuts. I had to use my fingers a bit to form the cookies since there was more dried fruit/chocolate than coconut/egg mixture to hold it together. If I would suggest anything, it is maybe to add more coconut/eggs, but they turned out fine as is. I used parchment paper on the sheets, and the cookies came right off. Thanks for a great recipe!"
324790,307486,2010-02-01,5,"I just love ""deviled eggs"" and these were no exception.  I took the advise of Kayne, and used 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice.  I reduced the paprika mixed in,  by half,  and used the remainder to sprinkle on top of the eggs.  Perfection!  Made for Everyday Holiday Tag-Jan'10."
28346,95222,2006-03-31,4,"I guess I can't add much to the opinions of 155 other people!  These were easy to prepare, had a good flavor, and were fairly tender after cooking.  Good combination of flavors in the sauce."
400817,157595,2007-04-18,4,"This was delicious, with the juicy, flavorful meat falling right off the bone. I used six legs with skin removed. I used Recipe #223023, and substituted 1/4 cup white wine for the water. It was a hit with my family! This is also definitely a very simple way to prepare cooked chicken or turkey for other recipes that call for it."
642189,65340,2008-11-10,5,These were to die for!  Excellent.  I made a batch this weekend and they are already gone.  Thinking of making more tonight (but half the batch just so I don't gain 80 lbs from eating these delicious rolls!!!
325816,15608,2007-11-29,5,I've been using this recipe for a long time. My SIL made this and it was so delicious I had to ask her for the recipe although I do not use water chestnuts and I use only 3 oz. of pasta.
4470,99450,2004-09-09,5,"This salad made me say -""Wonderful""  The raspberry vinaigrette is so refreshing. It has a clean flavor that is difficult to describe - try it and you'll see what I mean. When it comes to eye appeal it wins hands down. I made four individual salads let everyone dress their own. This allowed me to show off the berries, onions and nuts to best advantage. I made the full amount of dressing and am happy to say I have some stashed that will be a nice treat for me this weekend. I could nor find candied pecans so I used candied Cashews - great. It  was enjoyed by all, even one very fussy eater. Thanks Gay just Love this salad."
211831,50722,2007-01-04,5,"My kids love cinnamon buns and I wanted to surprise them with a batch yesterday to cheer them up ~ returning to school after the Christmas holiday is never fun. I liked this recipe because it didn't include an initial rise period. That cut down on prep time substantially, and didn't affect the finished product in the least. I would only change one thing.  I would spread softened butter on the rolled rectangle first, and then sprinkle with the cinnamon brown sugar mix.  All in all, the rolls were delicious and my three daughters devoured them eagerly.  Thanks for posting!"
1157312,460934,2011-08-07,4,"My household is a little divided on this one.  We could taste the sour cream, which we didn't care for, but otherwise the flavor is just like a pumpkin pie.  I used gingersnaps instead of biscotti to enchance the spice profile, which worked well.  Besides the sour cream, the flavor was good.  Makes me want some pumpkin pie!"
2001664464,184890,2018-02-24,0,"Love this! It was fast and easy and delicious, especially on a day when we got 6 inches of snow!"
213139,306817,2009-07-11,5,"Made for 1~2~3 Hits.  This was outstanding!  I was a little skeptical of using tomato sauce in an oriental-style dish, but this recipe proved me wrong.  Served it to company and they loved it.  I did have an issue with the sauce not getting thick so I did stick my crock in the microwave with additional cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce.  Thanks for posting this jkoch!  Will make this again."
35251,29679,2009-09-09,5,"Easy... a crowd pleaser. I cut the recipe by 1/3... and there were enough small bars (which are rich, so small works!) for a party of 10 people."
371738,26373,2010-03-30,5,"Wow, I marinated these overnight and skewered the chicken for my kids.  5 stars all around.  I wish I could post a picture but they went so quickly.  I can't wait to try them on the grill!  Thanks, Kate."
867152,28768,2014-03-03,5,"So good! We made it for our friends that just had a kid and they said it was the best meal that they had dropped off for them. We added crushed red pepper, and would probably do mushrooms next time."
35848,29569,2002-07-18,5,"Oh yum!! This is so light and delicious for a hot summer day dessert. I thought I'd have leftovers but not a crumb was left - thats how much we loved this. Light, refreshingly sweet and easy to make - five stars in my book."
46318,347607,2012-01-26,5,This is just as good as any restaurant.  I have made it several times now.  Sometimes we add some cooked chicken to it and make it a complete meal.  Thanks for the delicious easy recipe!
2002054627,115220,2018-03-16,5,"This is my 3rd year useing this recipe and it turns out great every time. In case it's not obvious you can use other cuts of beef other than the brisket. For me it's not always an easy cut to find or afford, but I have had luck with several different cuts. Either way it's a good tasting recipe"
1227576,87775,2009-04-05,5,Wonderful and delicious!
341170,375531,2010-01-22,5,"So sorry I didn't review this before! Made it quite a while ago! This was a great ""something different"" potato dish! I doubled the cream cheese cause I love it in mashed potatoes but otherwise made as directed."
345234,27000,2006-11-26,5,"Yummy!  Served with fat free vanilla frozen yogurt and also added a streusel topping.  Very good Barbara, thanks!"
861886,141983,2010-05-14,5,"I don't normally comment on recipes, but this sauce is by far the best I have ever tasted. Maybe someone should send it to Olive Garden."
452355,479861,2014-02-09,5,"What a lovely brunch this made today!  The directions were spot on, the prep was pretty easy, and we really enjoyed the zing of the piri piri sauce over the finished frittata.  It looked lovely on the plate as well, as you can see from another reviewer&#039;s photo.  We had to use jarred roasted red peppers, as that is what we had on hand, but this worked out really well.  Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.  Made for Rookie Tag February 2014."
1195537,380111,2009-07-31,5,"This was a delicious fruit salat und the thyme syrup was the icing on the cake! Easy to make and inexpensive, a wonderful summer dessert. Thanks for sharing!"
430471,222170,2008-03-17,5,What a great recipe. The flavor was nice and spicy but not overly hot.  I used canned diced tomatoes with chillis instead of fresh so I only used one jalapeno. Thanks for the great recipe to help me stay on track and eat great.
61660,236995,2008-08-13,5,"Terrific supper especially on a weeknight.  Knowing DH's tolerance for spicy is pretty low I only used one can of diced chilies, which was fine.  Loved the flavor!  I served this with spanish rice and a tossed salad.  Very filling!!   We fought over the leftovers.  Thanks!!"
1105991,347583,2009-11-14,5,"I love this salad! The toasted cheese was such a nice, tasty treat! Thanks, diner! Made for PRMR tag."
253021,117281,2006-10-30,5,"I loved how beautifully this came together.The buns were very good.I used bread flour.Next time I will try using half of bread flour and half of plain flour.We had these with vegetarian chiken style burgers.Simply yummy!I also made the eggless mayonnaise from this site(#34260), and it was fabulous with the burgers.Thanks for the recipe,Kittencal."
772870,52366,2008-04-20,5,This was the best steak rub!  Better than Outback!
2324285,487059,2013-05-28,5,"Very good, and I loved that I was able throw this salad together in less than five minutes (aside from making the glazed pecans the night before).  I used baby arugula and mini turkey pepperoni, so there was no chopping needed.  This almost tasted like a deconstructed pizza salad.  I liked it a lot, and maybe I&#039;ll try it with some sun-dried tomatoes next time.  [Made &amp; reviewed for PRMR]"
1574518,291663,2010-03-10,4,"I made one of these. Just used the beer I had at home. It came out quite dark. All my friends loved it! To me, it is bit on the sweet side. I think I will cut back on the brown sugar and the butter when making it again"
239788,74958,2006-01-16,5,Always a HUGE hit with company. I made a pan of brownies.. put them in the frig. Mixed up this cheesecake (without the crust). Spread the cheesecake over the brownies. Put all of it in the frig. After it set up about 2 hours I drizzled melted chocolated chips on it. NOthing betther than chocolate brownie and cheesecake together. I have tried other brownie bottom baked cheesecake recipes and the brownie ended up either burnt or undercooked. This works out great. Thank you for your great posting. Even my SIL who can't boil water can make this with great results.
27443,192847,2006-11-11,5,"This is excellent. Also very good using other fruit toppings like raspberries, peaches...Thanks for sharing"
340130,69656,2007-07-05,5,This was very refreshing and made a beautiful presentation with the peaches in the glass. Great idea and great stuff. Thanks !
736554,369355,2010-03-09,5,"My husband loved this recipe.  I thought it could be more spicy.  Next time I will add red pepper flakes to the shrimp.  I made as directed but did not add the snow peas.  In place of the snow peas,  I added more mushrooms and carrots.  Nice dish.  Thanks MSW.  Made for Ausie Swap."
77458,85138,2004-03-26,3,"I was curious about this recipe and the use of Splenda sugar substitute. I tried this recipe this afternoon replacing the granulated sugar for 1 cup of the Splenda. It was pleasantly surprising! This turned out to be very much like a ""light"" pineapple cheesecake. Very moist, not too sweet. I would, however, use real granulated sugar plus the cinnamon for the topping. Thanks, Jessi, I'll make this over and over."
406741,313978,2010-07-07,4,Really great recipe! I may be the only one who thought the mushrooms didn't even need the sauce?? They came out of the oven so juicy and great from just the spices- but the sauce was good also. Served with quinoa and roasted asparagus for a main dish.
25119,15062,2001-12-03,5,My Mom makes this all the time with the leaf lettuce she grows in her back yard.  Must be a Southern Illinois recipe!
65955,76994,2003-12-26,5,"This is just a wonderful delicious and healthy dish. I love the mix or orange and fennel flavors in it, and it is so beautiful garnished with the basil. It's a rare recipe that's easy enough for every day, but delicious enough for company, but this one fits the bill! Thanks for sharing it."
444528,84510,2007-07-24,5,"I followed the directions exactly as written and it made one GREAT cake! I will definitely be making this again very soon.

A couple of minor comments:
There was very little grapefruit taste to the cake itself. The poppy seed taste, however, was excellent. If you want a more citrusy cake, I would recommend doubling the peel to be put into both the batter and the glaze. I might also substitute a quarter cup of the buttermilk for some more grapefruit juice.

Thanks for a real keeper, RÃÂ©eLani!

UPDATE:  I made this again (it's really that good:) and this time made a citrus buttercream frosting for the top and decorated it with starfruit.  I didn't think this cake could get any better, but the frosting really added a nice zing!"
169430,272405,2007-12-27,5,"I agree with Jen in that this isn't your traditional ""mac and cheese"". I actually like it better because I can enjoy it and not have to think about all the bad things that the high sat-fat is going to do. Broccoli is my fav veggie so this is a real hit with me. I used lean ham in place of the chicken because I have leftover from Christmas dinner and it was great in this. I also cut the amount of pasta in half and I thought that there was lots in it. Thanks so much for posting this Jen. Made for Photo Tag."
548189,80661,2008-02-01,5,I wanted to make this for super bowl sunday but tonight I figured I would test it out to see how I could make it work since I couldn't find the rings. I used the mini ones. They are so YUMMY!! Can't wait to get them ready on Sunday! Thank you so much!!
297540,130042,2006-10-15,5,"This bread is so delicious, and  downright awesome!  It is the best blueberry bread I've ever tasted.  It has just the right sweetness, and is so moist. I only made one loaf and it vanished quickly. Its a keeper for sure.  Thanks for sharing."
280271,247681,2011-09-20,5,Very tasty dish. I made mine into wraps using butter lettuce. This was very easy to prepare and was packed full of flavor. I omitted the peanuts only because I couldn't have them. This is a keeper and will be made again. Thanks for posting. :)
280271,320309,2009-01-07,4,"DH and I really enjoyed this German potato salad. It has all the right ingredients to be a true German dish. We normally have ours cold, so this was a nice change. The hardest part was peeling and dicing the potatoes while still on the hot side. Thanks for posting. :)"
417333,251214,2007-10-02,5,this is excellent! A great chowder for a cold day.
359220,33671,2008-01-10,5,"Definitely one of those moments that changes the way you think about making dinner!  Just got a new 6 quart crockpot for Christmas and thought I'd try this out.  Night before, coated chicken, placed on bed of sliced onion and carrots, next morning set for 6 hours and was waiting for me on warm setting when I returned.  Perfectly cooked meat, skin wasn't too bad, but you could crisp under the broiler for a few if you really wanted to.  Soooo tender the chicken fell apart as I tried to remove it from the crock.  Drove my poor dog crazy to smell it!  Thanks Kathy for giving me the ability to make a nice roast chicken any old night of the week!"
93997,142725,2016-08-21,5,I love this stuff !!! What am I saying? My whole family loves it :) So glad I found this recipe and decided to try it. I usually double the recipe as this is pretty popular around our house. Only changes I make are: leaving out the pecans and coconut And adding a can of mandarin oranges (the larger can if double batch). The pudding mix I buy actually has a small amount of finely chopped pistachio nuts in the mix. I'm open to trying it with nuts and coconut but I have picky eaters so maybe I'll do half and half one day. Thank you for a great recipe that I have made many times now since finding it. Best Wishes!
1355934,193454,2012-09-09,5,"Excellent! Had over pan-seared pork chops (thin cut) and couscous. Easy and elegant. Next time I will add a bit more port, as I love the tart flavor."
1635476,67405,2010-06-19,5,"Yum! :D I sprinkled a bit of koesher salt and crushed dried rosemary on the top of the first loaf, and on my second loaf I put in cheddar cheese cubes and chopped jalepanos for an amazing side to some tomato soup. Thank you so much!!"
1086570,204179,2012-09-24,2,Very disappointed in this recipe. I had medium size apples but they we hard after the 20 minutes at 420 degrees. The 420 made some of the stuffing hard and hadf  a little burned flavor. I would suggest reducing temp to 375-350 and increase the time to 40-45 minutes. I may make it again with changes because it is easy to make.
258285,109647,2007-09-10,3,"Even though a 'spice' cake such as this is not one of my favorites, this was good.  I cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cups and the shortening (veggie oil) down to about 3 oz. due to the previous review.  I also used a mix of currants and saltanas.  I had no allspice so used mixed spice instead.  Definitely a moist cake.  Served it to my MIL who stopped by for tea...she ate two pieces of it!  Thanks Paula. :)"

2363371,264210,2012-08-14,0,Super easy and very delicious!
798181,99843,2013-11-26,5,Made for New Year&#039;s Day &amp; it was delicious. I did add some more good old bacon grease. So so good!
43642,164176,2007-02-18,5,"I made these for Valentine's Day and they were wonderful!  As you said, sweet, but very very good.  Thank you!"
1803066303,518168,2014-08-25,5,run dont walk to buy your A! sauce!
604332,173942,2007-10-03,4,This dish was just great. It's the first time in a long time I cooked something that tasted just as good as it was healthy. Thank you! I added salmon furikake wich gave it a little more flav but it was great without it too.
369947,190977,2006-10-25,5,I make these all the time and sometimes I add chili powder or other spice to make spicy fries.  I never have leftovers with this recipe!
240552,218213,2008-02-16,5,"Yummy and easy dessert!  In the crust, I used only 1/8 c. sugar. I might up the crust for the pan next time.  I had a hard time spreading the chocolate part on the graham crust but that is probably because I forgot to chill it.  I used regular cream cheese but might use light next time to cut down on fat and calories a bit.  I made this for a family that the wife is in the hospital but saved some for us, too."
520150,67291,2007-07-14,4,"This was my first time ever making duck.  Both dh & I were pleasantly suprised!  We both liked it.  Although, I think I liked it more than he did, because I ate all the left-overs.  The glaze was very tasty.  I don't know how much more duck I will make in the future, it's more work than chicken.  But if I do make it, I'm using your recipe.  Thank you very much!"
1758631,87748,2011-11-04,5,"great recipe! i used low sodium soy sauce, only 1 tablesp of sugar made up the difference with ginger and garlic! thanks"
88099,195501,2007-04-29,4,This was delicious and went well with our mexican meal.  I had quite a bit of the sour cream sauce left over so not sure if I did something wrong.  The flavor was excellent.  Thanks for sharing.
185293,105012,2005-10-02,5,Well I could've sworn I had reviewed this but I guess I didn't.  We just love this dish!!  So simple but such a flavorful side to almost any dinner.  Thanks Kittencal!!
65573,108778,2006-01-17,0,"we make this with different flavors of jello depending on the occasion (2 layers each of lime and cherry for christmas), except we add  1 pt of sour cream. After each jello/ice cream layer has set, spread some sour cream on top and then pour in next jello layer and continue.  We also make it in a bundt pan, although I will probably try it in a 9X13 pan next time, it seems easier than trying to unmold it from the bundt pan. "
1517556,225164,2010-01-22,5,"I prepared this dish for a pot luck with our choir, adding kielbasa for the meat.  During the meal several of the women and some of the men came over to me asking what was in the sauerkraut and if I would pass on the recipe.  This dish is a positive hit with everyone."
149363,132241,2005-10-18,5,"Yummy!
This was an awesome dish! I too sprinkled a tiny bit of cayenne before serving, as I had no middle eastern peppers. We really enjoyed the spicy, garlicky flavour.
Thanks for posting!"
8688,166052,2006-04-30,5,"This chocolate ice cream is heaven!  After making Charlotte's Angel Food Cake, I was looking for a way to use up some of the leftover egg yolks and discovered this wonderful recipe!  Creamy, rich and smooth! Delicious and rich in chocolaty flavor!  I made exactly as directed for a wonderful treat!  Thanks so much, Charlotte!"
630268,32844,2009-01-23,5,"A new favorite.
I skip the pepper for my kids, use onion flakes for my anti-onion hubby. And I never have parsley in the house, so I skip that too. Its so easy & delicious."
241241,16213,2007-09-14,5,These are fabulous! Everyone loved them & they were gone in about 15 minutes. Great summer app & I plan to serve around the holidays as well! Thanks!
96853,64132,2003-08-17,5,"This is a delicious and unique tasting jelly that I really enjoy especially on bread with butter.  I made it according to the recipe as posted and was very happy with the results.  It has a beautiful color and set up very firmly.  I had my husband (who has never tried red zinger tea) taste-test it, and he said it tasted like raspberries.  It has a unique perky fruity taste."
439056,220089,2007-06-06,4,"So yummy! My husband didn't like the cinnamon and our chicken came out dry (That was my bad...), but I loved it! I love tons of veggies in my crockpot dinners. Thanks so much for this recipe! I'll absolutley make it again. (With less cinn to appease the hubby! ;0) ) THANK YOU!! Love, Meg"
267022,69630,2008-12-20,5,"This was  awsome! I  made a coconut cake and modified the recipes a little. I used coconut milk instead of water, heavy cream instead of oil and a little less sugar and it was so moist ! Then I put a haupia filling in the Mine took 45 mins to bake in 2 9'' pans. Eveyone loved it , this ones a keeper. Thanks for posting!"
724631,257112,2008-10-28,5,"5 Stars, perfect!  The meat was tender, all the vegetables were done just to the right degree.  Each tasted ""clean"" because the broth had been well defatted.  I was surprized that the apple cider vinegar and the apple cider did not overwhelm any of the solid ingredients, the brisket and vegetables just tasted perfectly cooked.  Because DH returned earlier than expected from a trip, I chose to cook the brisket Sunday, strain the broth, let both the brisket and broth cool down and packaged them separately in the refrigerator.  On Tuesday, I strained the remaining, hardened fat, from the broth, prepped the vegetables and loaded up a 6-quart stock pot with the brisket, vegetables and strained stock.  The only drawback was that it took a long time for the brisket, broth and vegetables to reach a boil to begin timing the 1 hour of simmering.  I used canned potatoes and pearl onions.  I decided it was silly to use only 8 small onions -- they were hard to find when serving.  Why not use the entire jar!  DH thought the turnips may have contributed a nice flavor, but he could have done without them entirely.  In my opinion, the turnips add a subtle taste, and I enjoyed mine just fine.  DH added some Olivio spread to his cabbage, I enjoyed eating my food without further adornment. Thanks for posting.  Made for Please Review My Recipe."
202224,16048,2007-12-27,4,This recipe is FANTASTIC! When I flipped the scallops I hit them with a dash more of the spices other than that I followed the recipe as listed. Just as good as any restaurants.
83093,133412,2006-10-07,4,"Oh so easy & full of flavor! I used 2 large chicken breasts & needed a touch more sauce to make 4 full servings. Served over Spanish rice, this was a quick & tasty dinner.  Thanks for posting! "
1024930,388389,2009-09-18,5,"First, Thanks for the reviews on my recipes!!! Second, my Grannie used to make these for me when i was little and my mom worked at Race St. Fish Market. ( i was the spoiled first Great-Grandchild) Id ask for these ""Breakfast Cakes"" everytime my Grannie babysat me, and she always obliged cuz it was THE ONLY WAY id eat raisins!!!! thank you, THANK YOU for the recipe! i hope my own daughter enjoys them as much as i did! ~Darc"
219942,186820,2009-04-07,4,"My family really liked this recipe! To me, there was some taste in the envelope of seasoning that seemed strange to me. Cilantro, maybe? Anyway, I did double the sauce and tossed it with rice noodles, topped with honey-roasted peanuts. YUM! Made for PAC, Spring 09."
414794,47419,2006-12-28,2,"Did not like it.  Maybe I did something wrong, but it didn't have any kick.  It seemed bland and incredibly greasy.  Sorry :("
118585,30942,2006-11-14,5,I can't believe I haven't already rated this! This is one of my all-time favorite salads. Wonderful!
1803136702,74620,2014-09-14,5,Delicious! I will definitely make this again. Next time I think I will lessen sugar by 1/4 cup and add another tsp of vanilla (only because I want to cut back). So easy to do in blender! I was able to pour entire recipe into a deep (fluted) pie dish which I lightly buttered and floured- it fit fine. Texture was perfect. I used the skim milk. Husband loved it :)
2001419112,121359,2017-03-05,0,This was the first recipe I cooked as a wife when we moved into our first home and my family still requests it!
28604,94907,2005-06-21,5,"Well, I had to quadruple this recipe to feed my family, and it turned out great. However, I ran into some problems because I had to multiply the ingredients by so much- I used 3.44 pounds of boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut them in strips, which was good. But when it came to the plain breadcrumbs, I ran out after only using 2/3 cup + 1/3 cup, so I had to go over to a neighbor and borrow some of theirs- except theirs was seasoned bread crumbs. So, I only doubled the onion powder, garlic powder, basil, and black pepper. Then, I couldn't find any paprika or thyme, so I had to omit them. As for the cheese, I used freshly shredded/grated Parmesan cheese. This made 2 full baking sheets of delicious chicken strips that everyone kept saying were ""Really good chicken!"" I served them with corn on the cob, salad, and a bowl of fresh sliced strawberries mixed with grapes. I will be making this super easy  meal again! Thanks so much for sharing!"
242970,213597,2013-05-01,5,"THANK YOU! I finally can make biscuits that are tall and fluffy instead of hockey pucks. Not having any self rising flour on hand, I used recipe #5247 for self rising flour and followed your instructions after that. Made chicken and biscuits and baked it for about 17 minutes and had some dough left so made a couple of biscuits on the side. Everything turned out perfect. So long Bisquick biscuits!"
1094567,81494,2009-05-03,5,"This Recipe is really good, I did not have the Caned beans but did have a can of hominy tasted really delicious,"
208755,99103,2006-10-28,4,Very easy and very yummy! Thank you for sharing this one!
356127,158942,2007-07-25,5,Excellent.
129958,267178,2008-05-19,5,"I had some friends over this weekend and told them that they were being used as guinea pigs, meaning I was trying all new Zaar recipes on them.  These biscuit bites were delicious and my friends loved them.  Even my BF, who tries to stay away from bread had seconds.  I served them with grilled chicken tenders, Recipe #255134 and Recipe #30710.  These were easy to prepare and smelled so yummy cooking.  Needless to say, my friends went home with 3 new recipes!  Thanks Marg!"
217226,100762,2006-07-02,4,"A nice simple, tasty dish. I followed the recipe except that I left out the onion and stirred in an extra quarter cup cheese...we like cheese! "
486648,75827,2007-10-18,5,"I found this recipe in Food & Wine's November 2003 edition and loved it. I was looking for the recipe online (my magazine copy is in storage) and this is exactly the same one. It is SO good. It is not super sweet, but very rich and indulgent. Use a good bittersweet chocolate (I use Ghiradelli) as it is a very prominent flavor. You can make the crepes on a griddle for even heat or even buy the premade ones to make this dessert come together faster. Excellent!

***I just wanted to add that I made this for a work function and got rave reviews including professions of love and requests for the recipe."
1971302,252690,2011-09-19,0,"Made this recipe for the family tonight and it didn't get good reviews at all.  I added some minced garlic and onion and it still was extremely bland and greasy.  Unfortunately, there were no requests to make this one again.  My daughter actually requested that I ""stick to the box"" Mac n Cheese."
2001383413,205890,2018-05-09,3,dough was beautiful and the cookies baked up nicely. The flavor is just nothing to write home about. Kinda plain and not much peanut butter flavor.
2691896,18185,2013-02-13,5,Love this recipe. Foolproof and works every time. I would love to try it for mini-quiches but am unsure how to adjust cooking times. Has anybody else tried this who could offer some advice? Many thanks x
393251,19259,2010-01-01,4,"Good, easy recipe.  I make it just as suggested, but add a few extra garlic cloves.  I only think that it's a little bland, but a good basic recipe."
1056692,221284,2013-10-24,5,Great breakfast. I think this would be equally great with different flavors of protein powders. I didn&#039;t need to add any flavored syrup to this before eating as it already had a sweet enough vanilla flavor. My only change was to sub pecans for the sunflower seeds. I&#039;m glad I made a full batch. Thanks for sharing.
2362129,267374,2012-11-14,0,This was delicious and tasted so much better than any store bought brand. This recipe is definitely a keeper.
779699,400309,2009-12-15,5,This was an excellent pie crust. I used for an apple pie for a family dinner. Thanks for posting I will make this again!
227607,118124,2006-07-06,5,This 5 star is for the mushrooms only!!!  They were great.  We could not get enough of them.  We also did the steaks but now we know that we do not like sweet on our steaks.  Even the little bit of brown sugar gave it too sweet of a taste for us.
1986158,81489,2012-12-01,5,Simply tasteful and delicious. I ask myself why I never tried calamari steaks at home! My husban and I just loved this simple recipe.
169430,464618,2015-11-25,5,"This was a big success yesterday. We had the first real Snow Day of the the winter and after dinner pie by the fireplace seemed a perfect idea. I used Splenda in the crust and half of the amount of brown ask for of Splenda Brown in the filling. We all agreed that some more cranberries wouldn&#039;t be a bad thing but 3 of us ate half of the pie so no complaint about it as is. Used Ambrosia apples. Ideal for fall and winter, Thanksgiving and Christmas."
538190,9554,2008-09-05,5,another beautiful recipe by Bergie!!!!!!!! hunny this is to die for!!! thanks for a spledid recipe my whole dinner party was RAVING about!!!!
88099,90367,2006-09-18,5,"Awesome.  This was my first braided bread attempt and it turned out great, with a couple of flubs on my part.  I also added the green onions (which is what I used) to the butter and microwaved them together.  Bread was very tender and full of flavor.  I only made 1 loaf but used all the filling and it truned out great.  Thanks for a real impressive loaf of bread."
2330520,397335,2012-07-15,5,Yum! Very nice although we didn't have any Hungarian Paprika on hand to use so just added more normal paprika. We also didn't use enough olive oil when searing the meat and had some very well done bits stuck to the pot afterwards so recommend not repeating our mistake :-).
836651,23151,2013-07-11,0,I added 1/2 t ground allspice. (The &quot;Ball Blue Book&quot; for canning calls for 1T of whole allspice).
1444619,3407,2009-12-07,4,"My 1st Banana Pudding. It was very tasty and quick to make. Its almost like a Pudding Cake, anyway I love it and the small chunks of banana are a bonus :)

Would have given 5 stars, but since its my first Banana Pudding attempt ever, I'll stick to 4.

I liked the ambiguous instructions.. 
1 1/2 cups of milk it is. :)"
668861,400691,2009-12-01,5,Yummy!!!! Wow these r awsome!!! I just made them pulled them out of the oven and had to have one they smelled so good! I had 3 small apples I wanted to use up and decided to try this I will most def be making this again! The only things I did different is I didnt have jumbo muffin tins so I used regular and it made 18. I lowerd the cooking time due to that. Also I kinda got ahead of myself and threw all the ingredients together  (other than the apple filling & cinnamon topping) and mixed it together with a hand mixer. Thanks so much for posting this I can't wait for my kids to get home I will b lucky if any r left for breakfast tomorrow especilly once hubby gets ahold of one!!!
2919809,3745,2013-08-24,5,I&#039;ve made too many of these! They&#039;re great!
37636,274289,2008-05-01,4,We thought these were good but would have preferred them to be a bit crisper. They had a nice spicy flavor that I think would be good with many Indian foods. Thanks for sharing.
2002168173,329804,2018-05-28,4,"made this last night. tasty. stay with the 3 min boiling if you want a syrup. 4 min boiling made it thicker, just like instructions said, with consistency more like the chocolate topping in jars. But tasty none the less."
59780,65199,2007-05-11,4,"I made this using your Recipe #65193 and it was a quick and easy way to make muffins. I used raspberries, blueberries and blackberries and the only change I would make would be to add more sugar. Thanks for posting!"
29063,124940,2005-08-21,5,We loved this - I omitted the shrimp due to my allergies and added some Mrs Dash for extra flavor but otherwise kept as is. It got great reviews and will be a regular addition to our BBQ routines. Thanks!
65025,66596,2007-05-20,5,"Made this twice today.
One to go for a Graduation Party over a HUGE salad.

The other for me and my Mom to share.

Yum!  If I would have had some good crusty bread I would have dipped and forgotten the rest of the dinner."
404043,158832,2010-05-22,4,"Loved these potato's! Hubby did too. 
I had to add a little more butter as, I think my potato's were larger than large, if that makes sense. :0). 
I served these with cabbage, carrots, green beans and ham with beans. Great dinner and a really good recipe for fried potato's. 
Thanks!"
889802,350563,2009-07-21,5,"This is a great recipe.  It's thick and hearty and makes a lot.  There are a lot of ingredients and it's somewhat time consuming, but well worth the effort."
907492,129835,2009-09-20,5,"I'd never made eggplant parmesan because I didn't want to fry the eggplant, so I was SO excited to find this recipe! I used toast instead of rolls, but found myself ditching the toast after a few bites and just eating the saucy, crunchy, cheesy eggplant. I munched on a couple of the smaller pieces plain, too, as they came out of the oven--they are good plain! I think if you spiced up the crumb mixture a bit more, you could use this recipe to make mock ""fried"" eggplant sticks as an appetizer. (I am freezing some of the breaded eggplant pieces for later, too. I am thinking it will make a fantastic quicky lunch.) Thank you for posting this recipe! I love it!"
41809,78289,2004-04-15,5,"WOW!!  Fantastic steak, KC!  Very simple to fix, and uses ingredients I keep on hand, anyway ...  The sauce is TDF!  Be good on most any meat, but, it sure dolled up the sirloin!
Thanks for posting ...  I'll be making this again!  Laudee"
131915,19487,2004-06-23,5,These are awesome!  The batter was thicker than I thought it would be but they came out perfectly.
573090,46877,2008-12-22,5,"OMG,,,what a great cookie,,, i will definitely keep these in my cookie jay all the time,,, i used jam on them and they just melt once you bite into them,,, way to go,,,, thanks so much.."
2813961,146536,2013-05-14,5,These were so juicy and flavorful. I ended up using maple syrup instead of molasses and thyme instead of sage in the final garlic rub but it worked out really well. My husband loved them and so did I!  Thanks for a delicious brine and the great idea of a final rub before cooking.
756031,349101,2009-02-04,4,"This recipe appealed to me because of the lemon (my son loves ""lemony"" potatoes).  Very simple and easy, will make again with a few herbs and pepper.  Made and reviewed for Dec. '08 NZ/AUS recipe swap."
145352,158326,2008-05-04,4,Good and easy!
170628,2189,2006-12-14,4,"This was very delicious and creamy.  My husband is not a fudge lover and he really enjoyed this version.  I usually make it the traditional way with a candy thermometer and this was much easier.  While it did set for me, it was much more soft set than I am used to, almost truffle like in firmness.  I think someone who does not like the cloyingly sweet traditional fudge will really like this recipe.  And it is MUCH easier than regular recipes."
292308,94031,2008-03-21,3,"I can't speak on authenticity, being a Southern gal, but I'll speak on taste.   These were pretty good.  I had problems with too much ""juice"" at the bottom of my pan (oil?  juice from the deli meat?)  Whatever it was, it was icky, and you had to drain each portion before transferring to bread (or you got soggy bread).  The deli meat was very simple to prepare, but I think next time I'd just as soon use Steak-ums (much cheaper, similar result).  All in all, we liked it.  I definitely will stick with the provolone after trying this--as far as that goes, I'm a convert!  No more processed cheese slices for me!"
107583,164898,2007-05-27,5,"These were delicious biscuits.  Reminded me of Grandma's.  I am going to use this recipe for shortcake, too!  Thanks for posting."
1122519,31342,2009-10-13,5,"Great recipe! The whole family loved it! One question, for OMAC do you freeze baked or unbaked? Would love to  have this on hand for  speedy ""scout night"" suppers! Thanks for a great recipe!"
104295,98646,2006-01-15,4,"A little drier then I expected given the amount of liquid, but a tasty high fiber muffin none the less.  Thanks Roosie!"
88099,237848,2009-01-23,5,"Excellent.  Loved the flavor that the Chipotle peppers added to this Guacamole.  Next time I need to add 2.  I didn't get the onion, chiles and salt really smashed very well, but it didn't seem to alter the falvors.  I made this as directed and would not change a thing.  Served this on top of tacos tonight and some side chips.  Thanks for sharing.  Made as a bonus tag in Pot Luck.  :)"
59780,55189,2004-02-10,3,"I have made chicken in the crockpot before, and it always falls apart and turns into a big mess of bird. The little trick with the foil balls prevented this from happening. We enjoyed this recipe, although the flavour was really nothing special. I think next time I will add some additional spices and prehaps some additional garlic."
317719,38424,2010-09-13,5,Great recipe - and so easy.  Thanks for posting.  I made fairly close to the recipe directions with the exception of not buttering the skins but spraying with Pam butter-flavored spray.  Came out a little less crispy than I'm guessing butter would have but still great.  I also added chives to ours.  Really enjoyed!
35783,12624,2006-05-22,5,"I have tried many recipes for Bloomin' Onions and Onion Rings. This is, by far, the BEST recipe! Instead of making rings or a blooming onion, I cut the onion into ""petals"". They taste great this way and there is little to no mess. 
Thanks for a great recipe!"
2001533170,61525,2017-05-12,4,Its looks super delicious. Thank You for sharing such a great recipe with us. I liked it so much http://www.kashishfood.co.nz/rice.html
593726,73432,2008-04-29,5,Very good!  Excellent taste and soft on the inside.  Thank you!
1052065,314367,2009-09-10,5,"This is the first dressing I ever made. I will never buy a vinaigrette again. This was so good I will be eating salad daily until this is all gone. 
Made for PAC Fall 2009.
Thanks for sharing Cat Berner!"
96177,75302,2007-04-07,4,Jelly... your recipes are always the best!  We actually liked this casserole better the next day. This one is certainly a keeper.
1193707,314255,2013-09-23,5,"Delicious, but I couldn&#039;t pair it with anything...  Very refreshing.  The only thing I will differently next time is less sugar.  Otherwise, perfect poured over lots of ice on a hot summer day!  Thanks for sharing."
29088,4451,2002-11-01,5,My Grandmother made these bars every Christmas!  For a feastive touch she would use both Red and Green Marishino Cherries.  Thanks for bringing back fond memories of my youth.
708919,144798,2007-12-30,5,"I am Jeannie Finley's daughter and she wanted me to post this for her b/c she is computer illiterate :ÃÅ¾ This Recipe is AMAZING and would recommend to anyone, quick and easy, too!"
599450,353790,2013-04-28,5,"What a great recipe. Restaurant quality, to be sure. I will make this again and again. Thanks, swissms, for another keeper!"
398121,32386,2008-10-12,3,Pretty good for a one time try.
118268,106697,2012-04-26,4,I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  It was a hit around our house!  I will be taking the ingredients up to our camper to make this salad for all the impromptu gatherings. Thanks for sharing!
1623265,381,2014-02-06,5,I really like the addition of orange zest. It&#039;s very subtle.  It was very good.
1196284,351722,2011-11-21,2,"The flavor was good but I should've went with my natural instict instead of the recipe.  My mom always taught me to use egg when ""frying"" with oil on the stove and to use oil when baking or grilling.  Medium heat was too high and it was not crispy brown like the picture.  I had to throw it in the oven for about 10 minutes after it being on the stove.  I also agree with other reviews about the cheese/breadcrumb mixture isn't enough.  I only had 2 chicken breasts and had only a bit left over.I probably will not make this recipe again."
2154235,471979,2012-01-20,5,"Cannot compare to the soup featured at Olive Garden, but made this last night and it was excellent.  Halved the recipe, except for the broth, and omitted shredded mozzarella.  Honestly, soup had so much flavor that you could also omit the cream cheese for a low fat version, but would have less velvety texture.  Used less salt (and low sodium broth), adjusted seasoning at end.  Did add a healthy teaspoon of Better than Bullion (reduced sodium chicken) to enrich flavor.  Suggest yukon gold potatoes, as they hold shape.  This is a keeper!"
497060,46739,2010-08-30,0,"This was very very good, the sauce is amazing, couldn't stop thinking of what other dishes to use with the sauce.Kids loved it."
185285,123095,2005-06-19,5,"Wow.  ""Symphony"" is right. The blend of flavors here is superb.  I used whole wheat flour and macadamia nuts.  Also, I only had 'Quick Oats' on hand.  These cookies are outstanding!  If you like strawberries and chocolate - THIS is a must.  ** My cooking time was around 20 minutes per batch and I got 28 cookies**"
541083,278983,2008-05-05,4,"Excellent recipe. Easy to make. Everyone in the house loved it. The only change I would make when I make it again, and I will, would be to substitute finely, chopped country ham that had been lightly sauteed. I think the salty ham would provide a nice contrast to the slightly, sweet soup."
424680,205884,2007-01-25,4,"Got to admit that I decided to make this recipe because it looked so easy [& it is easy!] & also because it includes raisins and apricots! Extremely easy to put together, & very tasty, too. AND, since I have a chicken tuna salad that includes apricot preserves, I used this version of apricot preserves in it this morning ~ it added an interesting & very enjoyable demension to my salad. Now I want to try this jam on pancakes and waffles, too! This is one I intend to make again & again!"
169411,20277,2005-07-26,4,"My husband and I love this recipe.  My kids won't eat it. You have to really like sauerkraut to enjoy this one. I make my own breadcrumbs for this instead. (cut up some bread, toss with some melted butter and bake in oven till brown and crisp.) Then add this on top the casserole. "
2001192380,98934,2016-11-12,0,"i love this cake,made it since i was young,i double the topping too lol. so easy so fast. bit crumbly but yummy."
135470,369613,2009-05-20,5,"These were simple and delicious. Without the alioli, they were a little basic - only 4 stars; I was surprised what  a difference the alioli made. I tried this both with sherry and with a Portueges Port . The sherry mushrooms have a little more delicate flavor. I skipped the bread as we were out and just put the alioli on top.  Thanks Grumpy Chef for sharing your recipe. Reviewed for ZWT 5 for the Cooks With Dirty Faces."
1411207,61180,2010-08-24,4,Wonderful flavor. This turned out a little dry for me. Next time I will add more butter and brown sugar. Thanks for the recipe!
37305,21613,2002-10-13,0,"Until the recipe is corrected...please note that the milk should be 1 1/4 cups, not 1/4 cup!  Thanks!"
313691,40061,2006-04-25,5,"Impress your friend!!!  I didn't think the basil and peaches with pepper was a good match, but I tried it and it was fabulous!  I used dried basil and canned peaches and my mouth still waters at the sound of this recipe! "
2000383691,28398,2015-11-02,4,I made this for the first time and was very impressed!  I did not have Marsala wine so I just used the white I had on hand and it was delicious!  The only thing I would do different is season the flour before coating the chicken and browning it.  My 14 year old daughter did not like the plainness of the meat but once a little salt was added it was greatly improved.  I will add seasoning salt and pepper to the flour next time.  A huge hit and fairly easy to make!
2001411707,384797,2017-03-01,0,I have a question. If this is an authentic Old 1800's Eastern Shore Menu why is there OLD Bay included? Old Eastern Shore Crab Cakes could not have used Old Bay before 1934 as that was when it was invented. I also question the use of Dijon Mustard. It didn't hit the us until the 1906 St Louis Worlds fair. I doubt if it was in any Old Eastern Shore Crab Cake recipies. Sincerely Bill K
1591684,198660,2011-09-04,4,This was very good. I added a little Old Bay seasoning to the sauce but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I wonder how this would taste with shrimp and/or scallops.
132010,101651,2005-08-22,5,"I tried it and it was great!  Everyone loved it.  I added 1/4 teaspoon of the following: pizza seasoning, italian seasoning and garlic powder.  It was soooo good!!  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks for sharing!"
567380,152212,2013-10-17,5,Thank you for a quick and delicious recipe.  I made this using 4 chicken breasts.  They were done in less than 30 minutes.  This was easy enough for my 10 year old daughter to help make.  Thanks!
226863,439030,2011-02-03,5,Loved the flavor!  I couldn't grill outside.....30 degrees in Florida with sideways blowing icy rain!!!  Very disappointed I couldn't cook these my preferred method after marinating all day!  Came home from work and resolved myself to cooking indoors.  Still delicious!!!  Plus quick and easy once they went in the oven.  Made for Best of Tag 2010!
58407,107832,2006-01-03,5,"I made this exactly as written, for our New Years Eve gathering. I transported it to the party and kept it warm in a crockpot for awhile. Here in Central PA, we always eat the sweet & tangy. So, this is what I'm use to. Everyone really liked it and had seconds. There were 6 of us and it actually made more than 10 servings for us. Everyone had 2 each and I still had a little left. Thanks for the recipe! "
2919742,52629,2015-05-28,5,"I tried this recipe, the Elk roast turned out moist and tender. We will be trying this again in the future. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe :D"
350627,71876,2012-01-01,5,"We inaugurated our brand new bundt pan with this cake! I discovered that it was a 6 cup (not a 12 cup) pan, so I halved the recipe. The only change I made was to reduce the sugar from 1 to 3/4 of a cup, and it was still plenty sweet for us. Also, I used 2 eggs, and only 1/2 cup canola oil to compensate. I omitted the streusel, and topped it with an easy chocolate glaze (14 oz sweetened, condensed milk, 3 oz unsweetened chocolate, 3 oz semisweet chocolate, and 1 tsp vanilla heated together, and allowed to cool)."
512309,238227,2008-05-23,4,"This was a very yummy coffee cake.  I departed from the method of making it in an 8x8 pan, and instead I made it as a mini-bundt.  So I put about 2/3 of the batter in the bundt, then the berry filling, then crumbled the streusel on top of the filling, then put the rest of the batte in a smooth layer over the surface.  It came out as a tunnel cake, with the berry filling resting on a mound of cooked streusel inside the cake.  Everyone I served it to loved it.  But, a word of caution for anyone else who wants to try to make it that way -- let it cool about half an hour in the pan before trying to invert the cake to a platter, otherwise the filling is still too loose and runny, and the cake falls.  (Half of my cake fell, half didn't.  Go figure that one out!)
Thanks for the delicious recipe, Brooke!  Made for PAC Spring 2008 Orphanage."
2001440268,20643,2017-03-17,0,"Delicious!!!! Followed the recipe and it was very simple, fast and love love love the way it cane out! This is the fried rice recipe I will stick to forever!!!! Thank you."
660759,38413,2008-07-05,3,"Great taste, but became soupy quickly."
68960,57972,2006-01-12,5,"Sharon these are excellent. A real burst of flavour. Quite an Indian flavour. I served these on toast for a quick, light weeknight dinner. Thanks for posting!"
2062432,256545,2012-12-08,5,"Absolutely, Hands Down, the best turkery I have ever served.  I will always brine my turkey from now on!"
120108,106399,2005-12-09,4,"Overall, these cookies actually went over better after they had completely cooled. I added chocolate chips to the recipe as well. My youngest son liked them the best -- he ate more than anyone else did. (He's currently 20 months old) I didn't add as much ginger as it called for as well -- ginger tends to be a bit too strong for my tastes. ""Cookie good myself I do say"", says Yoda! LOL  "
679953,289453,2009-02-20,5,"A fantastic meatloaf. I actually doubled the recipe, and the 4 of us devoured it. The flavoring was excellent, and flavorful.  Spouse thought that there might of been too much brown sugar, but she had a second helping.  The kids and I LOVED it, and I wont change a thing on this recipe. hanks for a great recipe."
37449,195240,2007-01-03,5,I ended up cutting the potatoes in quarters so I could get as much yummy browned outsides as possible. Loved it! Thank you Danny!
2001341715,347164,2017-01-07,5,"We wanted to try something new and different than the usual... so I picked this it was wonderful an tasty I agree with KellyChris it's moist but not so moist it dissolves in your mouth. My husband doesn't like onions so I made one batch with onions and one without.. My family LOVED these , but I would say defiantly eat while hot wouldn't be good cold and salt to your liking. :) hope this helps! I will be doing this again already printed out recipe to put into my book so def a keeper"
211184,273762,2008-04-18,4,"*Made for PAC Spring 2008* This was a terrific basic pie crust, light and flaky. I used it to make recipe #273552. Very easy and very tasty. Thanks for sharing."
207176,210730,2009-02-01,4,"These were pretty good. I used Italian crumbs and used garlic powder and some onion powder too.  I used 1 egg.  Instead of making these in sauce, I baked them for 25 min. at 350 degrees and added them to sauces.  I made a double batch and used 2 different sauces. Thanks!"
27961,215902,2010-02-04,5,"Thanks for this keeper. They are so easy, and even more tasty. I take them from the freezer, and wrap them. I keep checking them until I can get the water soaked toothpick through. They need to be as frozen as possible or they will come apart during baking. I will definitely be making these a lot. By the way, these were just as good after cooling to room temperature."
1803328795,20049,2014-11-11,5,"Simple and basic.Caution.While cutting the chilies, be aware if you have any small cuts on your fingers , the juices will burn.Also avoid touching your face or sensetive areas until you THOROGHLY was your hands!"
1803166895,505731,2014-09-24,0,i remeber those good old school days with good old chocolate  splodge.yummmm
8629,87383,2009-08-23,4,"This recipe divided in half very easily.  I had to improvise somewhat. The Ramen noodles I had were chicken flavor but all I had was either beef or turkey. So I went with the ground turkey as the meat for the Lo Mein. It worked out well. I used fresh vegetables which I cut up very, very tiny so that they would cook tender-crisp in only a few minutes."
37449,85170,2005-05-03,5,"This was so easy to make with good results! Great for a quick dinner. I halved the recipe and served with penne pasta with spinach, and a romaine salad. Thanks Trisha, we will make this again!"
335571,3745,2009-01-21,5,"Delicious muffins. I don't even like blueberries and I liked these. They were perfect-just the right amount of sweetness! I didn't have plain yogurt so I used blueberry and it worked just fine, I think."
366781,34382,2009-08-30,4,These were good.  I did use a bit less milk as it seemed like it would be too watery if I used the 1/2 cup.  But they did taste fine.  Not too much garlic flavor though.  Might use more next time.
59064,38767,2003-01-09,4,I will make this again but next time I will use 2 avocados and a thick Greek yoghurt as I would tend to use this as a dip rather than as a dressing. Very nice. I agree with the crabcake comment - this would be excellent with seafood. Also a great thing to have if you are starting to come down with a cold - that wasabi is guaranteed to clear the sinuses!
2000161856,269658,2015-04-24,5,I followed this recipe exact. What a great dish. Goes well with mashed potatoes.
353579,203592,2007-01-16,5,"My first attempt at crackers!  They were pretty easy - though they were more like squares (or some of them, blobs) since I don't have a star cookie cutter.  I love the cayenne!  I think I might use a bit of salt next time.  I used sharp cheddar, but this recipe could take a stronger flavored cheese, so I will experiment with other types.  I'll also try spreading the sesame seeds on top of the rolled dough before cutting, since pressing all those little crackers in seeds was a little tedious (of course it didn't help that I was in a hurry at the time).  Thanks for posting!"
369715,64399,2012-05-25,4,These were good and easy to make. I followed the recipe as written but next time I would have my ham cut a bit thicker. It was hard to spread the cream cheese on it without tearing the ham.  We really enjoyed these.
1639599,162187,2010-06-23,5,This is a dish that makes me proud to be Portuguese!!! I always serve it over Basmatti Rice and everyone loves it. I have brought it to many potlucks and I always get asked the recipe
99844,69846,2003-08-30,5,This was very tender and good. I accidently told DH to turn the crockpot on high for 6-8 hours. We salvaged it after 3-4 hours. We will be making this again with the right settings. Thank you for a great recipe
1063848,319697,2011-12-18,5,"I have made Lemon Bars for years, and this is closest to my old recipe.  Thanks for adding it QueenBee49444.  The only changes I made were to add the zest of one lemon and 1 teaspoon of Lemon extract to the lemon mixture.  Wonderful recipe!  Thanks again!!!"
328931,122745,2006-09-26,4,this was really refreshing and nice. After a looong hot day this really hit the spot. DH and I enjoyed it. thanks marg
179133,225518,2011-06-23,5,This was tasty! I had this with some leftover roasted turkey (would be good in the sandwich too!) and potato salad. Made a great quick weeknight dinner. Thanks for sharing!
338515,49200,2007-11-03,5,"Perfect potato wedges!  These were tasty and easy to make, I don't need to look for another recipe now.  I topped with them some chopped up cooked bacon, and some grated cheddar.  Divine!"
2002271640,344366,2018-09-10,5,"Made this after Christmas boiling the carcasses from the turkeys from Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners I had frozen for the broth. Hubby said it was the best soup he's ever had. Followed the exact recipe, no changes made except for the broth I made from carcasses. I can't remember if I had to top of with chicken broth or not, it's been almost a year. It freezes great! I cook all my OTR truck driver husband's meals and he can't wait until I make this again since fall is around the corner. Excellent add to the cold weather meals in the freezer."
718371,67921,2009-11-08,4,"Really good use of chicken from Kittencal's chicken stock! My dd,12, gave 5 stars, dh gave 3 stars, but liked it more when he added tomato salsa. I gave it 4 stars. I like the subtle salsa verde flavor."
237297,162894,2013-09-13,2,"This looked really pretty, I made it the day before so the flavors could intensify.  Just not nearly  enough flavor for us though."
23333,11489,2002-03-24,5,"Absolutely wonderful!!  I used Golden Lantern garlic flavoured Wok oil to stir fry this.  I also added some cauliflower - WOW!!  This is great - the meat is tender and the veggies come out crisp!  I wasn't sure when to add the soya sauce - so I added it at the end with the final toss.  As well, I found that I only needed 2 Tbsp of oil for the entire process.  This is a keeper - I will make this again!!"
195879,26557,2009-07-14,5,This is a real winner of a recipe. Especially for a family with a big productive garden.  I did use fresh garlic and oregano but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  This will be something we make on a regular basis.  Thanks for this 5 star recipe.
1182775,251751,2009-08-11,5,So delicious. Already a family favourite especially with my 21 month old. I usually add some grated mozzarella along with fetta. Thanks for sharing.
383346,306919,2008-06-22,5,I loved the creaminess of this gelato.  Why buy gelato if we can do our own.  And this one is perfect.  I loved the taste of espresso and amaretto (which I added at the end when the ice cream was almost ready).  All the ingredients are made to be together.  This is pure heaven.  Thanks Babes.  Good luck!  Made for the Babes of ZWT4.
359420,31072,2009-02-16,5,"A phenomenal dough.  I used 1/2 white whole wheat, 1/2 all-purpose flour and added some Italian seasoning to the give some flavor.  I also used instant yeast.  Perfect with some home-made pizza sauce!"
249517,10794,2009-01-19,5,This is the best recipe I've found since losing my own recipe when I moved. My kids love them and my nieces are begging me to make them some more. Big hit in our house!
776849,19224,2010-02-09,3,"I'm giving a 3. I usually use Old El Paso. Is Lawry's usually 'weak'? This seemed a little weak. I added more shakes of salt, cumin and chili powder. With that, it was pretty good."
140132,243965,2009-07-12,5,Wonderful recipe for the kiddos.....ok and the kiddos momma too.  Love it....yummy
220305,227490,2007-05-20,5,"We had this for dinner, My two year old and husband loved it!  (My husband believes dinner should be ""meat on a plate"") It is great and very colorfull."
239758,310341,2008-06-26,5,"Made half a recipe. It was a big hit with our vegetarian exchange student. He wolfed it down, and hubby and I each got a tablespoon. I used ghee, baby spinach (which cooked much more quickly), half a tin of chopped tomatoes and Recipe #174350. I 'melted' the peanut butter in the microwave for 15 seconds, so it was easier to mix with the coconut milk."
107583,363150,2010-12-22,5,"Nice take on one of my comfort foods.  My grandmother also made a dish similar to this, but without the oregano, which is a nice touch.  Instead of mixing the Parmesan in, I sprinkle it on top about halfway through the baking.  A great side with meatloaf and very easy!  Made for tag game at kittencalskitchen.com"
717221,241516,2015-01-11,4,Simple yet very tasty - the sauce really makes this dish. The only thing I will try differently next time is to thicken the sauce a little with some additional cornflour.
369715,398445,2012-04-24,5,Yum! I made these for dinner instead of breakfast. I had made baked potatoes the other day and had three leftover so I used those for this dish. I followed the recipe as written using olive oil for the oil. We all loved these and they smelled so good cooking. I couldn't help testing them a few times while I was cooking them.
1359178,301703,2010-09-10,4,"First, This stuff is fantastic and super healthy, but really who wants to be that healthy?  i pre-cook the crust for about 7-10 min and let is rise for WAY longer, then topped it with some gravy, mashed taters, corn, chicken (cooked in the crock yesterday)  with a little Romano cheese.  YUMMY time.  I always 4x this recipe and makes two perfect pizzas.  the leftovers are better than anything, yet there never seem to be any.  Thanks!!"
280271,168446,2009-01-27,5,Wow! These are good and so easy to prepare. Made them for one of our appetizer nights. DH thought they were very tasty for WW. :) I didn't have any honey mustard so we dipped ours in some sweet Asian chili sauce. I cut the recipe in half and it worked great. Made in memory of Kelly's DH Eric.
47907,106219,2006-04-28,5,This is a quick and easy treat to make for breakfast or to serve with a cup of coffee.  I made as posted and DH and I devoured them.  Thanks for posting a great recipe!
452940,423991,2011-09-14,5,This is a really great and quick soup to make. The bacon really adds a nice flavoring to the roux. The only change I made was to add 2 tsp of sugar with the corn to sweeten it (we love sweet corn). Thanks for another keeper!
132383,32253,2006-08-20,5,Totally loved them!  Thanks for posting...
654995,90487,2012-06-21,5,Yet another fabulous recipe from Kitten.  My husband is a food snob......so particular.  He loves these pickles!  We all do. On my second batch right now.  Had to get a bigger pickle jar....thanks Kitten
226066,301366,2008-06-05,5,For a light treat - these were WONDERFUL!! And they are so cute!! They do get a bit sticky ... but they are perfect for a chocolate fix! Thanks Coffeebarista!
364326,131090,2008-08-17,5,"Great recipe. I love the spices. There are so many Empanada styles I dont know which I love the most.
Love them all. Thank you

     sandy"
70072,50338,2007-07-12,5,"I've made this several times...it is so easy and tastes good too!  I liked the Progresso minestrone soup the best. I tried a different brand once and the flavor wasn't as good.  This is also great for a quick, light supper. I always try to keep the ingredients on hand so I can throw it together real quick if I need to...."
2001898046,59367,2017-12-29,5,"I never had posole before, but had a conversation with another Mexican-American about it. Made this soup last night and it was fabulous. Instant winner in my household. Along with the seasonings listed, I added a dash of cayenne and a bit of chili powder. My side additive: fresh diced tomatoes. Wonderful stuff, thanks for the recipe."
1173885,87782,2009-03-02,0,"These potatoes were delicious, I added an extra clove of garlic and added some more water during their cooking. These were simple and delicious - I loved the garlic and lemon and I made them nice and crispy. Perfect! Thanks for this recipe!"
36128,51360,2003-05-26,5,"YUMMY!!!  I so love this.  I actually used it with some pasta, and it was to die for!  THanks so much!"
587978,360192,2010-02-07,5,I have used this many times and can't believe I have never rated.  Its a lifesaver!  People won't try certain recipes based on it uses can of cream of something and they are missing out becasuse they can make it and not get all that sodium they are trying to avoid!  AWESOME
805309,76478,2009-05-27,5,This is so simple and delicious that it's in my regular rotation. My husband loves it. The meat is always fork tender. Great recipe!
1268449,364620,2009-05-14,4,"Yummy!  A great way to use chard (which I had some to use).  If anything, I added too much salt, but other than that, my 5-year-old loved it as much as me!"
549545,204259,2007-08-10,4,"This is wonderful!  I've made it a couple of times now, and couldn't wait 2 hrs to eat it the second time around.  Thanks!"
6357,44186,2002-11-10,5,"What a good loaf this made. I made it this evening(baking time: 1 hour in my AMC Dutch Oven). I served it with tea and everyone asked me for the recipe!
Thank You for sharing this wonderful loaf. I hope your stay in the hospital is short and that your back on Zaar soon as I miss you, really, I do."
1803081726,339474,2014-08-28,5,"This recipe is the most requested by my kids. And mind you, my kids are SUPER picky, not gluten or dairy free. I&#039;ve just recently started omitting gluten and dairy from my diet but kids still eat whatever. I made this for dinner one night and the kids LOVED it. Now they ask for it all the time. It&#039;s SO yummy! I plan on making the sauce for other dishes. I think this would be great with chicken as well. I substituted Red Palm Oil for the olive oil so my dish always comes out with this beautiful golden-yellow color. This is my go to &quot;in a bind for dinner&quot; recipe. Thanks!"
183381,25825,2006-02-19,4,I made this recipe for a group dinner.  It was nice and light after a big meal!!  The taste was wonderful.  I think if there was drizzled chocolate on top I would have given it 5 stars!!! Thanks for the recipe 
679438,272326,2007-12-19,5,"This is a great twist on an old favorite.  My mother, who lends a skeptical eye to new tastes, loved them!"
866298,196938,2010-07-17,5,"this was excellent! the whole family loved it. I did use fresh mandarin because thats what i had, i burst them open with a fork after the first few hours. I served over rice that i cooked with chicken broth and garam masla.  thanks for sharing."
135271,107980,2007-11-23,5,"This is become a staple at family feasts.  This recipe was so simple to make, and even my kids ate some.  Although I think i am addicted to it now.  I can't wait to try it with adding other herbs. 
My son was eating it by spreading on a cracker and then placing olives on top of that."
2000221767,15242,2015-05-24,5,"As good as this is, I can never leave well enough alone. I made this using 4-cheese Mexican instead of cheddar cheese. Also fried a half-pound of bacon &amp; chopped it into postage-stamp (remember them?) sized pieces &amp; added to the mixture. Then 5 minutes from finish, removed it from oven, added an extra sprinkle of shredded cheese &amp; a sprinkle of panko bread crumbs on top for a layer of gooey &amp; crunchy before returning to oven on low broil. Instantly a new family favorite."
1719901,342603,2010-11-28,0,I forgot to put 5 stars!!  but here they are.. it was terrific and soooo easy.
50969,51638,2009-08-22,3,"I made this recipe on 8/21/09 as part of mine and SO's dinner. And since I used a bread machine, the recipe was made as follows.Added the milk which was warmed to 80 degrees, then added the slightly beaten egg. Then added the sugar and flour. Made two little "" wells "" placed the salt in one, and the yeast in the other. I took the dough out of the machine, shaped into rolls,covered and let them rise in a warm place for almost 40 minutes.Baked at 400ÃÂº for 20 minutes. They rose up just fine with a beautiful golden brown color, and the taste was fine. But I really don't think that these will be made again, because they were really very heavy not light at all like I was expecting."
130531,148709,2010-01-06,5,"This is defiantly a five star recipe. 
I made this with top sirloin (and was a bit worried it might not be tender) but it just melted in our mouths.   I served it over rice too, and the flavor was wonderful. 
I hope others will try this and you get more reviews,.....it is certainly a winner.  
I used a package of sirloin that was about $4.00 and the recipe could easily have fed 6 people, so it is a very economical dish too.l  
Thanks for posting and I will be making this again for sure !  Donna"
107135,121332,2005-06-15,5,this was good i liked alot thanks for coming to my site dee 
227932,89559,2007-02-11,5,"OMG... we just finished having these for lunch... they were AMAZING!  The combination of apple, shallot, and garlic was to die for.  We used Swiss instead of Cheddar- my husband made another sandwich even after all the ingredients were put away!"
1260758,373796,2009-06-03,5,This is a great salsa! We enjoyed it very much!
226863,317230,2008-11-02,4,"I think I must have done something wrong.  My chips didn't turn our all that crispy.  I followed the directions exactly, and was scared they would be overdone because my oven cooks faster than others, but they still weren't crispy.  Maybe I used too much cooking spray.  I'll try them again.  Made for Photo Tag!  Thanks for posting!"
119374,62178,2003-12-29,5,"This sandwich may be the greatest thing to come along for me in years. I hate cleaning the frying pan and all of that stuff associated with conventional egg sandwiches. This was real good. I added a slice of american cheese, I highly suggest it. "
514992,69213,2007-11-27,5,Easy to make and came out perfect - Thanks!
82994,13404,2003-12-03,5,"I made this tonight and it was very good. I omitted the hot sauce and the mushrooms, because the people I was making this for (parents) don't care for either one. But it was very good and I'll be making it again. Yes BTW, I also doubled it using exact measurments from the recipe and it was fine. If I did anything to it I would maybe add more cheese, but as I said,..it's quite good as it is."
1840059,293243,2011-02-27,5,"We just made these cinnamon rolls this morning, and everyone loved them!  My 4-yr old was able to help, and I loved that we could make them in under an hour total.   I made modifications on the recipe as suggested in the reviews.  I added an egg, used TONs of extra flour when rolling, only poured in enough milk to get the dough consistency I was after, and put cream cheese in the icing with tons of powder sugar.  Oh, and we added sprinkles.   Such a step up from rolls from a can!!!"
4470,285887,2010-01-17,5,Top score - very tasty eggs.  I made 2 changes - I used Lite Havarti cheese and I didn't have Salsa Verde so I used my regular red salsa-  Lovely Sunday Brunch
572102,234373,2007-08-29,5,"Very good!! All the boys raved(my sons friends). I grilled these burgers, rubbed spice mix on paddies and refridgerated until I was ready for them. Grilled thick slices of a sweet onion and I grilled green chilies just until warm. Wow what flavor, we assembled at table, I made my own salsa, Didnt do ketchup salsa mixture. Thank you so much for a great burger recipe."
329753,2990,2008-01-12,4,"I left out the meat, but added bena sprouts, snow pea pods, and mushrooms.  DELICIOUS!"
620435,110697,2008-08-03,4,This was easy to make and was pretty good. I omitted the chopped pimentos as no one likes them. I used half Italian breadcrumbs and half regular. I think this could be varied to personal taste very easily and become a keeper.  I gave this 4 stars because one of my sons said it wasn't that great. I liked it and my youngest ate 3 helpings. Thanks for sharing.
354019,151372,2008-10-17,5,"Just the recipe I needed, quick, easy and oh soooo good!
thanks for the recipe!"
280166,166345,2008-08-09,5,These were very tasty and easy.  I added a few pieces of fresh rosemary because we love potatoes and rosemary.  Thanks for posting!
107583,222171,2007-07-15,5,"Great grilled vegies!  The Italian seasoning really gave this a nice flavor.  I could not find pattypan, so added some grilled red bell pepper.  I will keep my eyes open for the pattypan at the farmer's market and try it next time!"
1534122,438404,2011-01-23,5,"Made this tonight and it was absolutely delicious! I used leftover chicken from a roaster we had Friday.  also substituted 28 oz chopped tomatoes, 14.5 oz fire roasted tomatoes with green chilis, 3 cups chicken stock and 1 Tbsp tomato paste in place of the diced tomatoes, sauce and 2c stock.  I will make this again for sure"
537578,8060,2007-07-30,5,These were so good and easy to make!  I added some garlic and parmesean cheese and it was delicious!  Yum yum!!!
2191528,119661,2012-09-22,4,"This was a very good recipe, and for some reason I think mixing it up with a chopstick makes a difference.  Maybe since you have to stir harder to get the egg yolk to combine then it gets more air into it.  The batter was light and crisp and not at all greasy."
184469,29598,2005-05-15,5,"I made as directed except I added extra garlic.  I will make this again.  It had good flavor without being overpowering.  It's a crowd-pleaser if you are having a BBQ, and it's a bit different than the ""Cornell BBQ"" or Italian-dressing-like marinades that are both popular in my region.  I had leftovers over greens for a salad and it was still very good. "
640503,31273,2008-08-08,5,"Super tasty, fast, and easy- Thanks!"
1935520,136552,2011-06-19,0,this soup is easy and very delicious. All my family asked me to make it again. That is always a ringing endorsement.
1056692,44102,2009-09-13,4,"I don't really care for sweet glazes on veggies, but this one was a good compromise, as the Dijon keeps it from being too sweet, and the brown sugar keeps it sweet enough that my husband will eat fresh steamed carrots.  I'm not sure that makes any sense to anyone else, but I can't think of how else to phrase it...  But anyway, it's a keeper and I'll make it again!  Thanks for sharing the recipe."
556250,3294,2007-11-18,5,"KC This was AWESOME chicken! If I could have given it more stars I would have. I used poultry seasoning instead of paprika, but followed the recipe otherwise. I used 1/2 tsp. each of the onion and garlic powders. The buttermilk bath (overnight) made the chicken so tender, and so juicy. I was amazed. Because I had to do it in batches, I also put it in the oven at 350* for 1/2 hour. It came out crispy, juciy and full of flavor. I also added a teaspoon of the seasoned flour to the pkg of gravy mix I made and everyone thought I made it from SCRATCH! :) My girlfriend doesnt even like gravy and she polished this off. This is definitely a keeper for us. Thank you so much for sharing."
1056280,357753,2012-05-08,5,"I reviewed this recipe after I finished making it and I realize that I forgot to give it a rating.  Update to the review:  I couldn't wait 8 hours and had to try this tonight with pound cake slices and whipped cream,  It was light and refreashing! This one is a keeper!"
1055140,7585,2009-02-02,5,"I made one change and loved this soup. Served it tonight with a salad and everyone was pleased. The change was to replace 2 of the cups of water with 2 cups of Swanson's 99% fat free beef soup. Due to the sodium level in the soup, I did not add additional salt."
2197234,474771,2012-02-29,5,Loved them!  My 8 year-old ate three for supper.
437767,71109,2008-07-22,4,"Great cakey cobbler.  Not what I expected, but really tasty.  I prefer without ice cream but DH had his with.  Substituted 1% milk, and it turned out fine.  The edges crisp before the middle is done, but I'm not sure that can be fixed.  Will also try this with some peaches.
Thanks!"
64934,64149,2005-06-22,5,"This was an easy, tasty supper dish.   I used hot Italian sausage since we like things a bit spicy, and I also added some garlic to the sausages when cooking them.  Cooking time of 35 minutes was right on.  DH took the leftovers to work for lunch today!  Thanks Miss Annie."
316144,151943,2006-05-06,5,"This recipe is sooooo good, almost sinfully good. I made it for the first time last night for my family and it was devoured. I made it without many of the ingredients. No onions, bamboo shoots or bean sprouts and I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. It was incredibly yummy. Even my picky s-year-0ld loved it."
339204,27208,2007-04-15,5,"This was an excellent recipe, my 15 yr old son absolutely loves it...he's the one that had me rate this 5 + stars!!  Thank you!"
542159,250606,2009-07-15,5,It was love at first bite. The tuna mixed with lemon pepper and mayonnaise makes the best dressing for this supper healthy salad. We loved the way all the fresh flavors shard the spot light. The tuna add to this salad with out taking over and was not loaded down with mayonnaise (hooray). We will be making this a lot. Thanks so much for the post.
346883,393268,2009-10-18,5,Amazing result for so little work!  This one is going into my cold weather cooking rotation.
95743,107997,2008-01-09,5,Simple and excellent.  We served it over fresh greens.
164538,150376,2006-02-10,4,"This recipe had a really great flavor!Next time I make this though I think I will add some carrots and maybe tomatoes. I served it with a fresh green salad and french bread which rounded out the meal perfectly. And yes...I went back for seconds! Thank for the great recipe I will be trying this again. 
Bugmom"
405761,214699,2007-11-29,5,A great base. Cooked this for company who thought it was very tasty! I did add some pancetta and smoked portuguese bacon! Will definitely make again! Thanks!
170990,97003,2004-11-04,5,"This is the first time I have written a review, so you know this recipe has to be good!  Instead of using 1 cup melted butter, try using 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup olive oil.  I have even substituted a packet of ""Butter Buds"" butter flavored mix mixed with 1/2 cup hot water plus 1/2 cup olive oil instead of all butter - tastes great.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!"
138429,34207,2010-06-28,5,Delicious!!!!!! I  used vanilla vodka  in place of the tequila.  Will certainly make this again. thanks for sharing
549519,67013,2008-08-20,5,"Amazing combination of flavors!  I've made this four times for different groups of people, each time it was a hit! The flavors are so unique, wonderfulness in your mouth! I followed the recipe except I usually forget to add the butter and don't notice a difference.  I also cut down on parsley and add a bit of cilantro.  I made it without yogurt, but it wasn't nearly as good...yogurt is a must.  I serve this with Grilled Moroccan Chicken
Recipe #15580....highly recommended!"
226863,375929,2012-10-20,5,"Wow!  Excellent tilapia recipe!  5 Stars!!  When I see ""grill"", I think it means an outdoor grill (as in charcoal) so that is how I cooked this dish.  Using a charcoal grill means it takes about 20 minutes to get the grill ready, so I waited a while to reduce my sauce.  The sauce is wonderful.  I marinated for about 1 1/2 hours, then grilled outside. Perfection!  Made for Photo Tag!"
323186,490947,2014-09-08,5,"Ah!!   You know what I didnt do? Chop the hazelnuts!!!!      So apart from that, lol, as recipe :)   Lovely beans, enjoyed this new twist on a favourite vegetable.    Thank you lazyme,  made for International Agents of QUEST  , PNW region"
2761303,393523,2013-03-30,5,I made this for Good Friday dinner. I had never made shrimp before. But it sounded really good. I made it the first time using Chardonnay and the second (by popular demand) Riesling. SO good!!! I did find that there was a lot of sauce left over but no one complained. Everyone dipped their bread in in. DEFINITELY a keeper! Was fantastic and super easy to make!
273025,136589,2006-11-06,5,I made this for my family a few weekends ago and they went wild for it! Wonderful and simple to make!
601096,238907,2013-02-02,5,"Made these 2ce today!!  So simple and fast and everyone loves them, thanks for sharing!"
114027,317142,2008-10-03,5,Very yummy! I had three :) Thanks for posting this easy drink.
596506,253313,2007-09-25,3,Pretty good! Very easy to make!
189616,142033,2007-07-30,5,"I added walnuts since my family loves them. Brownies should be fudgy-but not oily, that is what I especially loved about this recipe. I've made many brownies from Zaar and this ranked one of the best of the best from my DS's and DH."
685704,43427,2007-12-12,5,"My dear tara If you don't need to eat sugar free then don't. I have been looking for a recipe for sugar free brownies, cause I am diabetic. my husband has the same comment about sugar free things, after taste. you wouldn't be saying that if you couldn't eat the sugar."
89831,385811,2010-02-26,5,"I made this on my indoor grill and it was simply fantastic! the chicken was so moist and flavorful, I also added in 1 tablespoon crushed chili flakes, and 3 large chopped garlic cloves, I look forward to making this outside this summer, thank you for sharing this great recipe Nif!"
485189,101104,2008-11-28,5,The kids loved it! Will be making this every Thanksgiving.
435360,222823,2007-11-04,5,My husband and I love Rib eye steaks and this recipe was excellent. I cooked them in an iron skillet to sear and finished them off in the oven till med rare.  The sauce was wonderful!  I added a little flour to thicken. Thank you for posting!
1785215,221240,2011-01-03,2,"I was so hopefully for this recipe,  with all the great reviews. it was dull and not very good.  I would not make it again. it had no depth for of flavor.  boring."
560862,122235,2008-04-19,5,"a delicious bread! crusty on the outside, soft & fluffy inside. it rose a lot better & faster than some other gf breads i have tried. the recipe looks a little daunting at first with all the ingredients & different baking methods, but it's very forgiving & really quite easy. i had to make some substitutions (used all xanthan-no guar, used eggs, used my own all whole grain flour blend) and it still turned out perfect. will be making this often."
386585,46369,2012-07-28,5,"Wow, this was a winner and packed with flavor.  I made this exactly as posted, using just the 5 cans of broth.  I think the addition of the sun-dried tomatoes and red bell pepper really amped up the flavor.  A healthy, hearty soup that is definitely a new favorite."
2001683788,19424,2017-08-23,4,Great easy recipe! My kids loved them. I used wholemeal flour and vanilla yoghurt instead of milk.
321860,94321,2007-04-24,5,Buttermilk and panko are the secrets. Very good. Here in Washington I've always used Progresso bread crumbs which are good also.
1546947,131018,2010-02-11,5,My husband and I loved it! He says it tastes just like in a restaurant. We used Sweet Baby Ray BBQ and it was perfect! I bought a 3.5 lb pork roast (shoulder) and slow cooked it for 9.5 hours. Simmered in BBQ sauce for 1.5 and it was perfect! Thanks for the great recipe!!
397915,208773,2007-12-17,5,So easy to make.  Thanks for posting.  Just what I was looking for.
1944859,70165,2011-07-19,5,"Good, quick dough. Cooked it on my Zagrill on the BBQ but found it didn't need any pre-topping cooking as it ended up slightly too crispy (did about 5 mins before topping, then about another 10 with toppings). Liked the idea to brush with olive oil. Will definitely use this all the time."
64625,51780,2003-06-05,4,"This was quite good,though I forgot to add balsamic vinegar & will make sure I do next time.  I'd prefer removing stems also, a bit tough to chew!"
526666,366578,2010-06-07,4,"These had a nice flavor, and the work involved was minimal. Next time, I would peel the potatoes. Mine were beautiful and crusty after 45 minutes. They were thoroughly cooked and the cheese was browned. Thanks for sharing, breezermom. Made for ZWT."
1189230,258232,2009-03-02,2,"I don't know if I did something wrong, but these cookies came out SO GREASY!  The only thing I could taste was the butter!  I was expecting something like a florentine lace cookie, a crisp, delicate cookie with a delicious rich ganache.  Instead the cookies were almost too brittle to handle and I had to leave them on paper towels to soak up the oil to even get them to be edible!  Is this how they're supposed to be?  What did I do wrong?"
1942831,315251,2011-06-27,5,What a delicious recipe.  I have made it 2 times.  Had to join to give you a review.
487263,218516,2007-05-27,5,"Great chocolaty cookies - as good as any Mrs Fields non vegan
variety!  Very easy to make
Batter is very sticky and 
wet but dont worry - it they still cook perfectly :)"
547750,92125,2007-11-03,4,"I'd forgotten that I made this for the cooking class I taught until I saw the competition for a tapas party menu! I made the classic Sangria. Same comment as others, just sweet enough without being too sweet.  I'll definitely make this again!"
163716,95222,2005-03-19,5,I made these a couple of nights ago and my husband said they were the best pork chops he has ever had.  I'm so excited about this recipe.  Thank you!
693289,30581,2009-10-23,5,This is a wonderful vegetarian soup. My entire family loved it. I left out the cornstarch because I don't like thickeners in my soup- so it was a thinner base.
79538,167942,2006-09-04,5,"We had this dish on Sunday, what a nice dish so easy to make and the flavor is very good I used the cream of chicken soup. I didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed some stuffing mix and sprinkle on top. This is a keeper. Thanks"
978197,2510,2010-06-15,5,"I also used my own pumpkin, cooked and blenderized, and it worked out great. Instead of cloves I used cardamom, and I used part whole wheat flour. Overall nice warm taste and good texture. I do not have 2 loaf pans, so I put half the batter in a square cake pan. It worked well, and I could see making it again this way in order to top with a cream cheese icing."
804550,167320,2009-07-06,5,Great creamy coffee beverage! Since I didn't have any whipped cream I topped it with chocolate chip ice cream. Delicious! Made for summer Comfort Cafe.
88099,137211,2006-06-17,5,Wonderful salad and I loved the dressing.  I used a combination of lettuce but had to leave out the cukes because DH can't eat them.  Thanks
37305,29282,2002-05-27,4,This was very good!  Much easier then making individual burritos or tacos.  I used taco sauce and taco seasoning mix and it turned out fine. (I don't even know what enchilada sauce is!) Serving all of the toppings on the side still made the kids think they were making their own.  Thanks!!
1903425,113914,2012-03-14,5,I made this cake for my daughter's 1st birthday. I didn't use the frosting so I can't judge on that.  The cake was moist and delicious. We topped it with strawberry frosting and it was perfect! I am definitely saving this one for making it again. Thanks for posting this one :-)
463202,200525,2008-05-31,4,"I really like this, but I love horseradish. :)  DH says that (as written) it needs the extra milk you suggest in the description, especially if you are using big fluffy bakers like we did.  Maybe with reds or golds, not so much.  Thank you for posting this excellent side dish.  Made for ZWT4."
167028,23218,2005-06-04,5,Excellent icing!  The only additional thing I would point out is that the canned milk in the recipe is evaporated milk. Thanks!
25455,34382,2005-11-25,5,Great potatoes--nice flavor and easy to put together.  We doubled the recipe for Thanksgiving to serve 12 and it was the perfect amount.  
376734,35901,2009-10-30,4,"If you're looking for a quick, crunchy and tasty pork chop dish this may be the end of your quest. I rarely use pre-packaged foods but gave into a tempting clearance price & bought a half-dozen boxes of Turkey stuffing mix. These are easy to make, but I would advise watching your chops carefully after 30 minutes or so. I also would reduce the oven temperature. I did mine at 400F and after 40 minutes they were dark brown and starting to dry out a bit. I would make them again, but add a few seasonings. I'd also bake at 375F. Maybe it's my oven...."
778172,64097,2008-03-30,5,"Great recipe, try adding if you like spicy, garlic, cayenne, jalapeno or if not basil, oregano parsley.  Can microwave leftovers for late nite munchies, won't be crisp but will be really good.  One of the easiest and best great  recipes I have found.  A five star indeed. Thank you, Beachgirl"
241538,10197,2008-02-02,5,"Very good!  Not having time to slow cook, I simmered the stew on the stove for about 3.5 hours.  Could have left it on longer.  The meat was still tender and the flavor of the stew was very good.  I did add potatoes and 2 cups of beef stock, as the wine was not enough to cover the stew in my pot.  Next time, I will slow cook!"
117073,244998,2008-12-20,4,"I liked this bread, but it didn't rise quite right.  That may have been my own fault for having used fat-free sour cream.  It is a nice flavor, and something a little different.  Thank you for sharing!"
389139,177073,2006-12-27,5,"I had no savory, so omitted that, and I used crisp bacon instead of ham....it turned out wonderful, and I thought I didn't like curry dishes!"
311569,21296,2006-10-08,5,"Followed this recipe except for the green chillis and celery and it was great! Probably some of the best chilli I've ever had. Just enough spice to make it lively,not offensive or toungue numbing at all (after all, whats the point of food if its so hot you cant taste it?) added some mexican cornbread to the recipe, mixed it all up, and dug in. It was so good, I actually ate two and a half helpings...Which is saying alot, because I had strep throat at the time! Outstanding!"
55729,31307,2004-06-05,4,"These tasted good to me - but the family found them *too* unusual. They were a bit overstuffed, but I didn't measure my cheese, so I might have had too much. Also, as a low-carber, I made these ahead to have for breakfast throughout the week - I wouldn't recommend that use of the recipe, because they got quite runny. Better to serve immediately."
56680,120282,2006-06-28,4,"This was a neat recipe, used fresh cilantro from the garden, great taste, but I think I still prefer butter, so I will use in in place of the mayo next time."
222037,47195,2007-12-03,5,"Tastes like Terra chips! Takes a couple tries to get it right, and my microwave tends to not  distribute heat evenly, but outstanding nonetheless!"
46660,30094,2002-12-27,4,"Very good!  I also used 3/4 cups teriyaki sauce, extra garlic, and rice noodles instead of regular.  Thanks for sharing!"
465659,361635,2011-08-03,5,This was so good and so easy!  My carrots didn't cook all the way through and next time I will cut them and the  potatoes smaller.  I pulled out the chicken and kept it warm while the rest cooked and we ate salad.  My 18 mo old loved it and so did we.  We definitely be making this again.  Thank you for sharing
2001010400,92506,2018-08-14,2,The ketchup ruins this recipe. All you can taste is ketchup. I replace 3/4 of the ketchup with additional tomato sauce and it turns out pretty good though.
39194,196837,2006-11-25,5,"These were excellent Lainey, although I used garlic bread crumbs rather than pieces of cubed bread.  Just something about larger pieces of bread in my meatballs or meatloaf that I do not care for.  But even with that change, I was VERY happy with these and they make great meatball sandwiches!  Thank you for a great recipe, and good luck this week! :o)"
394592,238171,2009-02-26,5,"Superb soup...rich and flavorful...I used what was on hand 'cause it was close enough and sometimes a crock pot recipe should not require shopping at all- right {{:) ???}...used 2 8ounce cans of tomato sauce with chili...threw in extra peppers (sweet and hot), extra garlic...some carrot some dried chili peppers (dehydrated from last summer's garden} I like a play of sweet and heat- went all ""Jackson Pollock"" with my spices...couldn't even begin to list them- which is why I can never share recipes properly w/ peeps ...cinnamon and cocoa stick out :)...pureed half and returned to pot...served with cashew cream and pumpkin bread...delicious - Thank You Prose...Made for ""I RED-OMMEND TAG""!!"
400817,61114,2007-02-21,5,"I had to use canned chopped tomatoes (2 - 14 oz cans), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and this was WONDERFUL! I served it with some pork chops that were a little on the sweet side, and these spicy potatoes were the perfect compliment."
37636,25450,2002-10-06,5,"I made these tonight and they were like sinful turtle brownies with your cup of latte stirred right in! There are 2 key words for everyone to remember about this recipe: NO LEFTOVERS!!!! I used some instant coffee and made it 1 tsp. to each 1/4 cup; did'nt have to wait for it to cool. I used lite condensed milk ""as if"" that were going to help me save calories!! But it does work great. I didn't use the double boiler with the caramels, I found they melted fine over low heat, while stirring. And yes, the house smells so wonderful while these are baking, there will be NO WAITING till these are cool till you try to get them out of the pan. Have some warm on vanilla ice cream: to die for!"
376986,162765,2016-10-22,3,Pretty tasty but it needs to cook longer. I was even using a small squash and the strands ended up being fairly tough still.
1846364,307631,2013-08-10,5,"Outstanding, but the need to leave steaks outside of fridge before cooking is one of those myths that have been thoroughly destroyed by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt at the Food Lab:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.seriouseats.com/2013/06/the-food-lab-7-old-wives-tales-about-cooking-steak.html?ref=obinsite"
107318,67100,2003-10-28,5,"We decided to make these in our FACS class. At first, all of us thought this recipe sounded really nasty. Who would put chocolate on saltine crackers? But, we decided to try them anyway, just to see how they'd turn out. They turned out to be SO good. Our whole school loved them. The principal said they tasted like Heath candybar. The chocolate gives it the flavor of a candybar and the crackers just give it a little crunch. These were delish."
352814,17865,2007-02-03,5,"These were so fun to make and brought back so many wonderful childhood memories.  My aunt used to make these for us when I was a kid.  She always brought them to the family reunion.  Of course, they are a HUGE hit with the kids.  Trust me, they won't disappoint!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe and bringing back some special memories!"
296085,455152,2013-10-23,5,"A delicious recipe. Very easy to prepare, as well. I did not have tamarind but used fresh lime juice and a pinch of brown sugar. &lt;br/&gt;We served it over white rice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for posting."
595391,207877,2007-09-25,4,"This dish was good and very tender.  I added extra fresh ginger (well the jar kind) and also ground-powdered. I also added garlic powder and some pepper flakes (like the pizza topping) to the recipe because my husband does not like what he calls ""sweet meat"" so I tried to make it more spicy.  I also added some chili powder and some cumin to step 3 (the above mentioned was also to step 3)
It came out good. A little too spicy for me (I am weak) but it was VERY tender.  The picture is exactly what it looked like.  I made this dish with the recipe for ""light and easy dinner rolls"" which was a great recipe to eat with the sauce. My husband and father both loved it.  It was an easy dish to make.
Thanks!"
170275,456,2007-09-18,4,"This was pretty good, I have been searching for a good dhal recipe. I liked the added cauliflower & tomato. My husband thinks a little spinach at the end would be nice as well. It made a huge pot which we ate for lunch the next day and still leftovers!"
665907,412993,2017-10-15,5,My kids live this. I usually skip the heavy cream and use regular milk and it still turns out great.
2610436,87380,2013-01-03,4,"I love this recipe! Especially, the idea to mix it together! I recently had the ""traditional version"" (cream cheese on bottom of dish, pepper jelly poured on top) for the first time at a holiday party. I really enjoyed the taste but I found the hard way that the jelly would ""slide"" off the cream cheese, thus causing quite a stain on a shirt or blouse. The hostess had a variety of crackers on the side, I preferred the Triscut."
1802946256,117532,2014-07-20,5,"I just created an account on here specifically so I could review this recipe. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I thought it was fanTASTIC! Since I got a little busy in the kitchen, the dough ended up sitting for about 45 minutes instead of 15 and it was absolutely wonderful. The bottom turned out slightly crispy and the inside was soft and perfect. I will definitely make this every time I make pizza~ THANK YOU!!"
424680,302334,2008-05-07,5,"Was a little aprehensive about this, but I do enjoy trying SOME new things, so . . . Did leave out the walnuts & the Sweet 'n Low, but added 1/4 cup of grapenuts & found the whole thing to be very tasty! Another time, with a bit of crunchy granola . . . Thanks for sharing your recipe!"
351811,202181,2007-05-14,5,"I never would have put this together, but it really worked! Loved the beer in it. The entire family loved this side dish. Thanks for sharing this great PAC recipe. ~V"
209747,216237,2008-01-05,5,Really nice side! We do not normally like cauliflower but I had to make this when visiting a special Ty guy in NC. He adored it and went back for a huge serving of seconds! This was really simple and tasty! The only thing I will change next time will be to cook the butter and flour as a roux before adding the milk but that is a personal preference. Thanks for a great dish that was completely devoured by young and not so young alike!
2757245,21768,2013-03-27,0,"I made this tonight for a senior pot luck dinner. Everyone raved about it. The best thing I like about it, it is it very easy to make and is easy to make your own. I added shredded pepper jack cheese to the top and put it in the oven for 10 minutes to melt. Awesomely good. If it was just for me, I would probably add a few jalapenos to the chicken and beans for just a little kick. Highly recommend this dish. (And  yes, the balsamic vinegar added a great flavor to the dish.)"
2680073,494698,2013-02-06,4,"Delicious, never would have though pizza and muffins could mix, but they do so wonderfully.  Still tastes like a muffin, with a slight pizza aftertaste with a little zip provided by the pepperonis.  Great treat!"
2001342969,66895,2017-01-08,5,They turned out really good! The only thing I did differently was not use shortening. I will be making these from now on.
731423,274379,2008-01-17,5,My husband and I absolutely loved it!  This will definately be one of our top recipes to cook!
37449,344672,2009-01-19,4,My DH and I both enjoyed the cake. It turned out a little dry on the outside and a tad gooey right in the middle. But it was very good! Thanks!
248023,35805,2008-08-08,5,"Really easy and delicious.  I put the ingredients in my ABM in the opposite order as listed... after slightly warming my water to 80F as my breadmaker instructs.  It was a beautiful dough... really easy to work with once you oil your hands...  I didn't let it rise the 2nd time since I ran out to get some cheese and my BF said it had been about 30 minutes since the dough cycle ended.  Next time, I will punch it down and let it rise since the dough was a little rubbery and a little hard to roll out.  I made one large pizza and baked it at 450F for 7 minutes before adding toppings.  One half I used red sauce and fresh mozzarella, and the other half, I used pesto, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and mozzarella...  I baked another 8 minutes... and YUM!  Really crispy crust and soft inside.  Next time, I will divide the dough into two portions...  Thanks for posting!"
179133,286024,2008-06-13,5,"This was great and very easy! I looked up the original recipe to find out how many olives to use since I like olives (it called for a 2.25-oz can sliced ripe olives, drained). I used all the optional ingredients (but skipped the green bell and doubled the red bell). I also used cheddar-jack cheese in place of the separate cheddar & mozzarella (used 10 oz total). I too like ""hot"" food so also added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes (about 1/4 tsp but more would have been OK). This was a good way to stretch a small amount of meat and also get some veggies. I also plan to try this with sausage in the future. Thanks for posting happynana!"
184762,49064,2012-01-01,5,"Left out the celery, but otherwise made it exactly as suggested and LOVED it!  This was our first Hoppin' John, and will likely be our only recipe.  Thanks!"
1086830,305899,2008-12-20,5,Always had a hard time getting the coconut to stick to shrimp when deep frying.  This one works great and the dipping sauce is exceptional!
1803285983,479817,2015-12-09,5,"This is the best! When we moved away from Portland, we needed to make our own fondue for Xmas instead of getting it at Gustavs. This is the same recipe they had on their website until recently, and we haven&#039;t been disappointed.  My mother in law prefers it with less cayenne, but we enjoy it with more or less. You really do need the processed swiss, we tried &quot;good&quot; cheese one year to our great disappointment."
173601,22756,2004-11-18,4,"This was a pretty good recipe!  The only problem I had was when the lasagna was done, it was VERY runny.  That might have had something to do with the type of wine I used though--not sure!"
296027,231218,2007-06-25,5,"Really flavoful.  I prefer ground turkey breast anyway, so tend to sub it in place of beef when possible for a healthy alternative.  That is the first part that drew me to this burger.  I love the use of artichokes, red peppers and onions, sprouts and the cheeses too ( I used slightly more and a blend of both cheeses for the flavor).  I agree with previous reviewers that the dressing makes a nice dip - especially with a corn chip.  Nicely done JJ Rollers!  ZWT3."
282252,230853,2008-05-06,5,"I'm getting ready to make this again.  It's delicious over egg noodles for dinner.  I put in some extra mushrooms and used both criminis and portabellos.  I had leftovers for breakfast last time, couldn't wait until lunch.  Thank you!"
57222,47195,2005-08-13,5,"I can't believe I've forgotten to review these! I've been making them for over two years already, with all kinds of seasoning mixes (plain salted ones tend to be the favourite, however!). Then again, I have little to say that hasn't been said already: wonderful, tasty, crunchy, delicious, and no added fat! Took a bit of time to establish the exact cooking time in my microwave, but once that was settled - perfect microchips! :-) Thank you so much for the recipe!"
1850267,344846,2011-04-28,4,"Didn't have the Canadian bacon, so we substituted bacon bits added to the bowls.  Also I used turkey sausage - I thought it was ground turkey. Very tasty."
1851271,365607,2011-03-11,5,Made this for dinner last night & it is fabulous. I added rosemary & sage to Step 2.  The meat was tender & had a great taste.  I served with brown & wild rice mixture.  It was also easy to do.  I will definitely make this one again.
32772,67664,2003-08-22,5,My lips are still smacking away. These are FANTASTIC!! Easy to prepare and the flavor was better than pudding pops from the grocery store. I used frozen Barcarde frozen drink mixes like Pina Colada and Strawberry Daqurri. The only change I made was to use nonfat plain yogurt and skim milk for a light tasting dessert. This is great for those weight watchers out there. I now have to purchase more frozen popcycle containers. LOL Thanks so much for such an outstanding recipe.
2324285,147686,2012-09-17,5,"After trying this, I don't think I'll ever make mashed potatoes without kale again.  Tastes great, and you can never have too much leafy greens in your diet.  I also added some chives to this, and used Greek yogurt instead of ricotta.  Really, you can toss kale into any mashed potato recipe and it should work.  Thanks for sharing :)"
59064,53176,2006-10-24,3,Maybe I put in too much lemon but I found it a bit overpowering. So I would use less of that. Otherwise it was a very good way of using zucchini.
251917,388247,2009-09-25,5,FALL PAC 2009: Wonderful change from classic tuna salad - love the addition of capers to this!
865391,13362,2008-06-18,0,this recipe tastes lovley i rate it 4 1/2 star
108843,35418,2006-03-08,5,"I made these yesterday, and they were just delicious. I followed the recipe, except for subbing ground chicken for the ground beef, and not using the sauce. We don't put tomato sauce on meat loaf or peppers. However, I did use the sauce in a shrimp Creole dish I made today. M-M-M, was it ever good. The clear instructions you provided were perfect, princess. I particularly liked the fact that all the ingredients were already in my cupboards. Next time I make the sauce, I think I will sub petite diced tomatoes for the crushed. But, my GDs have already informed me they want more.
Thanks for posting this keeper.

489552,49387,2009-07-13,5,"This was good.  However....I don't think I am a fan of eggplant.  Yes, this was my first time making eggplant, as I am always looking to fit veggies into our meals.  I did like the cheese, I'm a big cheese fan :D"
175492,353597,2009-09-28,5,"Made for Fall 09 PAC made per recipe except to half the recipe since I didn't need quite 15 servings.  This was a nice, easy brunch.  Not to sweet as was expected and totally delicious.  About the only thing I might do to dress it up even more (Not that it needs it) is to add some chopped pecans.  Thank you for a really delicous recipe, saving to my Breakfast Cookbook.  Hugz Lynda"
836545,247419,2008-05-10,0,very very and very good.
1662325,298166,2010-08-06,0,"I'll have to give this recipe a try without the banana juice, but in St. Martin they include a large helping of banana juice/puree in their BBC's."
1901804,57957,2011-05-05,3,There was way too much cinnamon to me. I thought the base was delicious though. in order to counteract the taste of the cinnamon I added lime juice and it was amazing
689332,339375,2010-06-14,5,"These were super easy and a really filling, satisfying meal. Next time I'll throw some rice in there as well!"
332909,136470,2007-12-22,5,"These were wonderful, and oh so easy. I followed the directions as stated,and they turned out wonderful! The only problem was there wasn't enough so next time I will definatley have to make a double batch. Thanks for a great recipe!"
788414,102763,2010-10-04,4,"Really liked this!  Did not add salt since the Creole seasoning has it already, but felt it was too salty, so I will see what I can do to cut back on the salt next time - maybe low-sodium soups and use a little less of the Creole seasoning.  I made whole wheat spiral noodles in advance, and threw them in for about 10 minutes to warm them up, and it came out great.  Thanks so much!"
621626,173559,2008-06-25,4,I melted 1 tbsp of unsalted sweet butter then added the spices to it. Next I added the plantains & stirred to coat them. They turned out with a good taste but I mistakingly  bought plantains that were not quite ripe yet. Made for ZWT 4
76535,117490,2005-04-29,4,"I sprayed these with cooking spray and oven-crisped them; they were pretty good. I think I'll add some drained, chopped canned chilies next time."
1098228,7674,2011-12-01,5,Two words.... very tasty.  :-D
409497,30146,2008-05-04,5,"This is fanstastic!  I've been eating it everyday on my salads.  I cut down the oil a bit, but it is so delicious for this cilantro fanatic!"
348302,5184,2009-02-02,5,"Very tastey! I did change a couple of things though. I added 2 cloves of garlic and used beef boullion in the water (also did not add salt since boullion is salty). I did not have a full 2 lbs of london broil, so I was afraid of not getting enough beef taste. Next time, I will use some beef stock instead of the boullion and probably 2 cups of corn. I loooove corn in beef stew.

But overall, the spices and tastes were great. Great starting off point to make this recipe a little more to my taste."
766615,339905,2011-12-08,5,O M G this is gooooooooood.
345314,29184,2007-04-18,5,I tried switching the amounts of soy sauce and balsamic vingegar to 1 teaspoon of soy sauce and 2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar and it is equally yummy!
727688,169855,2008-06-08,5,My WHOLE picky family loved this!   Meat was very tender and just fell apart.  Leftovers would make wonderful sandwiches.
120976,35390,2007-10-26,5,"I really liked the ease and smell of this bread. Very quick to make and few ingredients. 

Very tasty with honey and butter...yumm"
232532,402540,2011-01-16,5,"I thought it was spectacular! SO fresh and light tasting. It appeared to make a large tub of ""Cool Whip"", I suppose 16oz. Thank You for posting 80's."
1800244154,157418,2013-11-15,5,I normally don&#039;t like pork chops. I fixed this for my whole family and everyone LOVED it! I heated the honey and pecan in a separate pan from the pork chops. Great receipt!
141293,121772,2006-05-05,5,"How can these be anything but wonderful? A simple combination of my favorite things, avocado, black beans, tomatoes, and cilantro. Actually used this as an appetizer and cut up the corn tortilla and baked them using this as a salsa dip for the chips.  Also, used a whole avocado, otherwise followed the recipe exactly."
341170,66443,2007-12-08,3,"This was good, but a little bland. I will try it again with the evapoated milk, but for sure with more seasoning"
207176,197976,2007-03-12,0,"Just about to post this, it's from Food For Friends by Ruth Macpherson, 1997. Thanks for posting!"
17652,31750,2005-08-20,5,"OH. . MY. . GOSH!!  If there's a better waffle than this, I'll never make it because I'm sticking to THIS recipe!  We couldn't get enough.  Easy enough for my 9-yr-old to make and double yummy!"
42720,48901,2002-12-16,4,"What a neat idea!!  Definitely going in my cookbook and on my list of unique gift ideas.
"
177085,215098,2007-07-03,5,"LOVED This recipe! Any woman who is on Weight Watchers knows how hard it is to find recipes that are WW friendly that your hubby will actually like too!  5 Stars, loved it!"
789516,118832,2011-09-16,5,"These are some of the yummiest muffins I've ever made.  So moist!  Not too sweet.  I added raisins to the milk/oatmeal mixture to soak which seemed to work well, and used whole wheat flour.  Used large flake oatmeal."
1609858,350099,2011-10-25,3,Easy and tasty.
125923,47544,2007-11-25,4,"Very, very good!  My family would only agree to try it if I would keep the canned cranberry sauce on the table, but nobody ate it after trying this sauce!  I used 3/4 cup orange juice and 3/4 cup sugar.  I did not use the cinnamon-maybe next time I will give it a try!"
364135,141782,2006-10-25,5,"I made this last night and they ate their fingers off! It's juicy and flavourful, best roast chicken I had in a looong time. And very easy to do. Thanx Chef Zee!
Chantel K"
178017,149120,2009-09-10,5,"Very good, but eat them hot, they're not so wonderful after they have cooled.  My whole family likes these."
350750,133711,2014-05-14,5,Great tasting dish for a quick dinner.  Thank You!
694228,63138,2007-12-19,4,"I cut the sugar in half and used the batter without nuts for a basic mix for my kids.  We used pecans, too, which was yummy.  They do tend to fall apart if the griddle is hot enough or they haven't cooked long enough."
1555233,36806,2010-05-10,5,"I thought I had discovered the best pound cake until I met this one. WOW says it all! Absolutely delicious and a head turner.  It turned out perfect.  Moist, dense and heavy but light in a different kind of way.  I will make this my #1 recipe for pound cake.  Now my Ricotta pound cake has to take 2nd place."
428060,229165,2009-05-25,4,"Very tasty. I cut the chili powder and cumin to 1 tsp each so the kids would eat it. They liked it. Pretty easy, filling soup."
637016,28148,2009-10-06,5,"Yum!  My family loved this recipe!  I made a few changes: I didn't have green onions, so I omitted those, but added a can of green chiles.  I also added a can of red kidney beans (drained and rinsed) as well as a bit more salsa.  I substituted butter for margarine, shredded colby/jack cheese for cheddar and served with sour cream.  Will definitely make again!"
37449,28106,2005-11-19,5,"Oh my goodness, this was soooo good! Rich and crunchy and delicious. I served with Breyers all natural vanilla ice cream and was in heaven! Thanks Karen, I'm so glad I picked this for Zaar tag!  :)"
286566,347185,2009-05-30,5,"Wonderful bread, loved the flavours, did have to use dried parsley though (1 teaspoon) and I like to cut my bread all the way through, butter both sides and re-assemble.  Thank you gailanng for a great recipe, made for Edition 8 Make My Recipe."
1379021,440495,2013-01-14,3,"I doubled the recipe and got 34 cookies using a 3/4 ounce scoop.  I had to use more liquid to get the ingredients to combine.  If I make these again, I will reduce the salt and use less cinnamon."
369715,163571,2008-04-30,5,Loved them. Made for Spring PAC 2008. I recently bought some popsicle molds so used those. My youngest loved helping to make these and loved to eat them even more! These were very easy to make and set up nicely. Had never made popsicles before and will be making these again.
157080,138316,2006-10-15,5,"Wonderful recipe! I made the dough into little crescents and hearts and stars and then piped chocolate glaze on them and they were beautiful and they tasted wonderful. Thank you for such a great, easy recipe."
104295,280252,2008-01-25,4,These were quite good.  I used white wheat flour and fat free sour cream as it is all I keep in the house.  These were fluffy and had just enough cheese flavor without tasting oily.  We had them with soup.  The adults thought they were a little bland but the kids devoured them and continued to enjoy them cold in their lunches.  Thanks for posting.
286023,3470,2011-03-14,4,Chicken & stuffing is one of my DH favorite meals...and this one makes it easy on me.  He loved it & said it was a definite have again.
624150,147653,2008-09-17,5,these were awesome! So easy and perfectly spiced. I added some white chocolate chips. I'll definitely keep these ingredients on hand for when I get a craving for pumpkin cookies!
494068,357076,2009-08-27,5,This is thick with cheesy goodness and we all loved it!
46660,48760,2007-02-19,5,"This is GREAT!  What an awesome way to use ground beef!  I omitted the red pepper flakes since my heat-sensitive son was eating it, and I left out the green onions.  I did everything else as directed.  My onion-hating son chowed it down, and my ground beef-hating son did as well!  An all-around winner!  Thanks!"
2304747,10478,2012-06-24,0,This is the best bread recipe! I had tried it at a luncheon and I was instantly hooked. It was better than any dessert there!!! I have made it several times since then and my family eats it faster than cupcakes or cookies. This is by far my favorite bread. (Lard is the best with this bread...BIG difference)
2000809352,110936,2016-01-09,5,"Needed to use up some chicken livers, was dubious about the raw garlic, but WOW!! My 13 year old daughter is currently digging in... I&#039;ll be making these again!"
2001242748,243562,2016-11-13,5,Really simple. But I had to use Whole Milk. Great for Thanksgiving Dinner!
9869,59966,2006-01-05,5,Wow! This is really good..has everything you want in a meal..easy directions and wonderful flavours..I used bow tie pasta...straight in to my favourite file.
175174,89493,2005-03-08,0,"I just enjoyed these pancakes tonight. They were great! I was a little hesitant to try them because there was no baking poweder or soda mentioned in the recipe like other pancakes call for. I decided to give them a shot and just omitted the wheat germ because I didn't have any on hand. I follwed the rest of the directions exactly and was rewarded with great pancakes! Thanks for posting, this was a fast and easy recipe. "
438582,388695,2011-09-03,5,"Tried this today in the crockpot, and I just polled the family: thumbs up from everyone! I have always loved the combination of pork,onions,and apples, but to throw sweet potatoes in, too? Perfect! I agree with TylersMomTheChef that the dijon mustard gave a great kick... thanks for sharing, Starflower!"
102135,92878,2006-11-13,5,this is so good and tastey. ds and dd ate it and asked for more. good comfort food. thanks elissa
1984692,391024,2013-11-03,3,"Sorry I made this thinking it was gonna be quick but seemed like it took forever and I didn&#039;t like all the pans I had to use. So when it was all put together it was very bland. I even added bacon.. And an onion.. No one really raved about it in my house, after how long it took prepping it and the turn it&#039;s safe to say I won&#039;t use this recipe again"
366396,264809,2008-06-24,5,"I was craving rye bread with caraway seed and I found your recipe. Excellent! I t was everything I hoped for and more. The flavors shine through, the texture is wonderful. TY!"
102058,80717,2007-12-19,5,"EXCELLENT recipe... salt cod has a much better flavour than many  usual white fish varieties and this recipe makes the most of that wonderful flavour. We liked this so much that I made a small salad and DH and I just had these with it for dinner... and enjoyed every second of it too. I used Tabasco for the hot sauce and found my parsley was in very sad state indeed, so used coriander / cilantro instead, for the rest I folled the recipe exactly. Please see my rating system: 5 stars for a recipe that has already been enthusiastically requested again by DH and I will be making it often in the future because it is simply devine. Thanks!"
455970,25446,2007-03-02,5,"Oh my. These were amazing! I thought I made too much using 6 potatoes and also stuffing the tops for 6 large and 6 small, my boyfriend ate a mix of 6!! There is plently left over in the fridge for mashed potatoes later. They were magnificent - added to my recipe box!"
2780186,67733,2013-05-26,5,"Loved this coffee cake! Next time, I&#039;ll add the vanilla since I forgot it this time! But it was delicious without it too!"
470799,137968,2008-11-20,5,"yummy & easy. I went with another suggestion & added a can of diced tomatoes with green chili's. I didn't have mozzarella cheese, but used cheddar cheese & it tasted great :)Very tasty. Served alongside tortillas & salsa. Thank you for the easy & yummy recipe."
179133,21159,2006-01-27,5,"Yum yum yum! This was easy and quick to assemble. Had to leave out the parmesan when I discovered it was moldy :( Also didn't have cajun spices so I used 1/8 tsp each: cayenne, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, thyme & basil plus 1/4 tsp black pepper. Wasn't very spicy but still tasted good. Thanks for the recipe Tish!"
89831,179444,2006-08-02,5,"I made this using very well drained canned tomatillos, I could not find any fresh ones at my local grocery store, it turned out fantastic! I can't wait to make this again with fresh tomatillos when I can find them, I made exactly as stated using 7 fresh jalapenos from my garden, we like lots of heat! This is SOOOOOOOO good! thanks for sharing this great recipe Bones!...Kitten:) oh BTW this just gets better when left in the refrigerator lol!"
187927,211003,2009-07-27,5,"I absolutely adore this recipe! I made it probably 5 times within the first week of trying it. :) The only thing I do differently -- besides using rice milk instead of regular dairy due to an allergy -- is to increase the matcha to 1 and a half teaspoons, since the banana seemed to overpower the matcha flavor (for that reason, I also try to use a banana that's no larger than medium-size). I love, love, love this and thank you SO much for posting it!"
496803,272650,2010-01-10,4,"This is a very satisfying granola.  Just sweet enough, without tasting like candy, and the hint of vanilla is wonderful.  I really like the tart bite of the cranberry along with the sweetness of the other ingredients.  I just wish it stuck together a little more, for ease of eating out of hand."
464080,153344,2014-01-14,4,"Easy, yes indeed.  Had leftover thighs and legs from a rotisserie chicken and was looking for a recipe to use them up!  I used a medium salsa and still thought it was a bit bland when cooked, so I would add a tsp of taco seasoning next time.  Thanks for posting this recipe!  UPDATE:  We had some leftovers so I used it for taco salads, serving the meat atop a bed of lettuce, corn, and black olives, topped with a little more salsa and sour cream.  The taco meat worked well for this purpose!"
135566,268927,2012-03-25,4,"A quick, easy recipe.  It was very good, but we felt it could use additions - maybe green chilies and black olives to punch up the flavor more.  Served with Doritos Baked Scoops.  Made for Spring 2012 Pick A Chef."
199848,376569,2012-12-27,5,"This is not your ordinary egg salad!  This is majorly delicious.  I made this exactly as written, but used butter, instead of olive oil, to spread on the toasted bread.  I highly recommend using the smoked paprika and not changing anything about the recipe, as all these ingredients are key to making this egg salad special.   Thanx for posting; I can hardly wait to make this again!"
256795,109505,2010-12-22,5,Very yummy!  Used venison and it was really good.  Thanks so much for sharing!!  :O)
400708,198995,2017-01-27,5,"Easy and taste and looks great, I followed another reviewer and used pretzels sticks and added cilantro and chopped jalape&ntilde;o, got made at myself as had the bacon sitting there and forgot to put it in, still tasted great, i also used Mexican blend cheese"
598340,3470,2010-02-16,4,"This was good and easy to make, however a bit on the rich side for me . I think it might have been the swiss cheese, so ill leave that out next time. I shredded my chicken breast with a fork once they were cooked. I agree with a previous review, the stuffing was a bit mushier than I prefer. The 4 stars are for how easy it was, but I think I will make a few adjustments. Thanks!"
2907725,65816,2013-07-20,4,"I used only  1/2 fat sour cream and it was fab! substituted the bacon for chicken frankfurters, and my picky foodie son and hubby loved it! Only reason I didn&#039;t give it 5 stars is because it says 12 mins cooking time. But that&#039;s how long it takes to boil the potatoes not taking into account how long it took to get the water boiling. So it was more like 20 mins. Really clever idea will definitely be making it again!"
58038,170613,2007-09-17,4,"Ah, garlic! :)  Enjoyed this and no one knew it was brussel sprouts.  And it was very easy to make.  Only downside is that before the water, the brussel sprouts were a bright green but after cooking in the water they had that drab green color.  Made for Pick A Chef fall 2007 - cook the 6-PAC."
171345,123107,2006-02-16,5,"This tastes fantastic, so good in fact, that I had trouble getting it into the fridge to cool.  Had to keep tasting it to see if it needed more celery...nope it's good; maybe more onion; nope it's just right..lol
I only used 1 c.mayo because I wanted it a little drier and actually forgot the sugar which worked out fine because the pickle relish made it sweet enough.  I'll be making this again and again..winter or not, it's great.
"
845394,21084,2008-05-28,5,"This is a wonderful recipe.  I used boneless, skinless, chicken thighs.  My family loved it."
212609,343689,2008-12-28,5,"Incredibly easy to make,and with predominantly store cupboard items,this enchilada dish is a great standby recipe.I made mine with some Cheddar mixed with some Mexicana cheese,for a little bite.My DH practically licked his plate clean,and declared it gorgeous,so I guess I'l be doing this again.Thanks UGA Fan.Made for PRMR."
89831,373627,2010-01-03,5,"Loved these corn cakes, I added in some cayenne pepper and garlic powder and used 1 teaspoon seasoned salt in place of the kosher salt, these are so delicious, thank you for sharing Kitty, this was made for KK's forum tag game"
738401,148513,2009-06-09,5,"Finally, a couscous dish with some flavor!  I made this tonight for the first time and really enjoyed it.  I made as written with home made chicken broth and added both fresh basil and thyme.  I liked the idea of adding the garlic to the boiling broth so the garlic flavor isn't too fierce.  We were pleased with the results.  Goes great with chicken.  Thanks for posting."
288146,341002,2017-04-20,5,"Delicious! I honestly didn't think this was going to be very good, there's not much to the ingredients but I knew DH would like it. Boy was I wrong! This dish has an amazing depth of flavor we all loved. What is better than a dish that is easy, inexpensive, and absolutely delicious? I will most definitely be making this regularly. Thanks for sharing!"
227607,35801,2009-04-26,5,This was good.  We did add some 6 pepper seasoning on it too though.  It was not very peppery.
139475,9778,2004-08-18,5,"This recipe earned a ""very good"" from DH, who is pretty hard to please!  I actually used lamb neck pieces (very inexpensive) in the crockpot and it made them oh-so tender. I followed steps 1-5 as stated in recipe, only instead of adding meat to pan, I put everything into the crockpot, skipping the saute'ing of the onions and just putting them in the crock with pre-cooked, crumbled bacon.  I decided to add potatoes, turnips, and peas later since DH doesn't like mushy spuds, so I let cook on low without the veggies for 6 hours. I THEN ran out of time to add the veggies to the crock and have them come out cooked, so I boiled the potatoes and turnips together until almost done, and then added to crock with frozen peas and turned it to high for about 30 minutes.  It turned out great! DH said this is the way his mom cooks, and this reminded him of ""back home.""  Thank you so much for sharing this lamb recipe that I will use often!"
171303,78707,2005-09-21,4,"Really good one pan meal.  I did marinate the chicken in some lemon juice and fresh rosemary before adding to the veggies.  I also added fresh mushrooms and let them roast with the potatoes and they worked well, giving off a bit of liquid which helped wilt the spinach and prevented anything from becoming dry with the high heat.  Due to dietarty restrictions, I did cut back the oil to 1 tbsp and salt to just 1/4 tsp with good results.  thank you Marie for sharing the recipe."
161282,61946,2004-11-08,5,"This recipe just sounded so good that I had to try it- and am I glad i did! The only small touch I added was a garlic clove. Wonderful dish, Lorac- we really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!"
639498,55259,2009-09-21,5,"Absolutely loved this recipe! It was quick and easy and everyone loved it! The sauce was very good and adding the sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and spinach made it to special. My husband just about licked the pan clean!"
303700,197805,2007-10-07,5,"Reviewed for PAC Fall 2007
I just KNEW this was a keeper!Its very similar to the turkey soup I make ...the only thing that was'nt included this time was the cranberry sauce.
Delicious!"
844554,184592,2008-11-25,4,This was a good recipe. I also like the fact you could put it in the oven and not babysit it. Thanks.
222096,30359,2005-10-26,5,"Update on the 9/9/05 rating.  I have made this 2 more times since my last review.  Being from southern Maryland, crab cakes are near and dear to my heart.  The perfect crab cake has little filler and lots of crab.  This is it. I did learn a couple of things I'd like to pass on.  The oil for frying should only come up half way on the cakes.  Too deep and they will foam and fall apart.  Also, do not fry more than 4 at a time.  More will cool the oil down too much.  And lastly, make plenty, these get gobbled down real fast.  Thanks again for a terrific recipe!"
529209,125399,2007-08-25,1,"I tried making this one morning. The cinnamon and vanilla combination was just too strong. Next time I will ommit vanilla and just use cinnamon.Also, my bread sticks came out too soggy. I tried leaving them in the oven longer to make them crispy but it did not work. Maybe because my bread wasn't too thickly sliced. Next time I will toast the bread and brush the egg mixture on it and then place it in the oven. :("
150281,30979,2009-07-26,5,"Wonderful summer lunch after a long day playing in the summer sun. Easy as could be though the guys thought waiting the 15 minutes of cook time was longer than it seemed! *grin*

Everyone loved it, a simple classic."
58413,40983,2005-10-23,5,"What a wonderful dough to work with.  This is such a simple recipe to make.  And, as DH pointed out, you know these are good when you can eat them cold the next day and they are great then too!  I had made the dough early in the morning in the bread machine.  Rolled the dough into balls and then covered them with plastic wrap and put them in the fridge.  Lifted them out when I left for the airport to pick up DH and when we got home a couple hours later, they had risen nicely and I popped them in the oven.  Fifteen minutes later we had wonderful hot rolls that were SO light and fluffy.  I also used half and half instead of milk.  We will defiantely be having these again.  I can't wait to try them as crescent rolls!"
703869,315433,2009-04-05,5,Very good. Very easy to make. Will be making this again. Thanks for posting. Made for PAC Spring 2009
1060667,128504,2017-12-11,5,Loved this!!
227607,237224,2008-09-03,3,Sorry to be the downer but we did not really enjoy this.  The flavor was really good (which is why it got 3 stars) but the texture of it was really weird for us.  We love grits and we love quiche but did not like the mixture of the two at all.  All 7 of us took a couple of bites (the kids said it was good not to hurt my feelings until I said I did not like it) and unfortunately the rest got thrown out.  Maybe we would like it better with just the grits in it and forget the eggs.
406442,93034,2007-07-30,5,"Delicious!!! They certainly didn't stay on the plate for very long - easy to make, and kids couldn't get enough of it.  Have also tried making it with Minstrels... these don't go chewy like Maltesers - they just ooze even more chocolate; not that I'm obsessed with chocolate you understand ;)"
1675336,136292,2010-09-23,0,Made this today with the manacotti.  Delicious! Sauce was thick though. Used an extra can of tomatoe sauce which was perfect.
2174191,458576,2012-02-05,2,Improved texture and flavor slightly compared the making whole grain recipes that can be done in 4 hours.... BUT not by much. It's still taste like whole grain bread.
1689463,409404,2013-01-06,3,Sauce doesn't thicken.  We'll try it again with whole veggies instead of diced.
330545,6740,2008-07-17,4,If not for the shells tasting like a cheez-it cracker this would have been a five-star.  The filling was wonderful and I'll be making it again but using a regular tart crust.  I did omit the grated cheese topping.  TFS
242729,15055,2007-07-02,5,"I have not reviewed this with stars yet, as I have only just made the marinade last night and today - ready to use on grilled chicken breasts tomorrow or the weeekend! Thus far, the marinade smells and tastes totally divine and smoky - I LOVE the additon of the oregano, which I used from my garden! I am sure this will be a 4 or 5 star recipe - but will award the stars when I have grilled the meat! I was lucky enough to recieve some dried ancho chilies in a recent swap, and I have been wondering what to make with them, so, thanks Sassy Erin for posting this lovely recipe - made for ZWT3 - FT:-)
Added: 02/07/07. I used this on chicken breasts this lunch time - and it was JUST gorgeous! SO tangy and tasty - a real winner! Thanks Erin!"
378488,100180,2009-02-08,5,"Easy and the family loved it.  Used half and half, instead of cream.  Great use leftover ham from Xmas or Easter."
960339,27520,2009-11-12,5,"Mmmmm! Can't believe I never tried this before - so simple and sooo yummy! I doubled the garlic and added 2 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp cayenne, a few dollops of Worchesthire sauce, a little salt, lots of black pepper, and some fresh chopped parsley which I happened to have. I used 1 can stewed tomatoes, and 1 can diced. Smothered with parmesan. Gave it lots of flavor and just the right amount of heat (IMO).  Will DEFINITELY make agian. Thanks a bunch!!!"
2001465009,530645,2017-03-31,5,It was delicious! Turned out good for me. Taste just like shrimp scampi. Though I can't find round wrapers here in my area to make it look like these. The square ones work fine. Will be making it again very soon. Might try with crab.
22015,97194,2007-09-24,5,I omitted the olives (I don't like them) and the pine nuts.   I found this to be very tasty and easy.   Next time I may add little bit more of the tomatos and red peppers though since I won't be adding the olives.   I will definitely make this one again.
496803,191804,2008-07-19,5,"This marinade is outstanding, and the quantity given here is enough for about 8 chicken pieces.  When I have them in my garden, I usually use fresh herbs for this, dried work as well.  I use it for OAMC cooking, as follows.  Place marinade in a ziplock bag.  Add chicken pieces, and coat chicken well.  Remove as much air as possible, and seal the bag.  Freeze.  Remove from freezer 24 hours before cooking to thaw.  Cook as you wish.  I usually throw these on the grill."
664225,230714,2009-09-02,5,"Here is an excellent recipe that made our tastebuds say ""WOW""!"
599450,307531,2009-02-22,5,"This is absolutely delicious! Very healthy and hearty and earthy. Very primal! Loved it! Thanks, Sharon123! Made for <b>Vegetarian Recipe Swap</b>."
660350,28768,2014-12-26,4,Really yummy! I added half ricotta and half cottage cheese. I also added a tomato paste can full of water. Next time I will probably double the sauce to have some on top and any leftover sauce would make great sauce over spaghetti!
55523,137542,2008-12-28,5,"Amazingly, this was enjoyed by my entire family.   That almost never happens with new recipe finds.  I only had 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup on hand and used it.  It was phenomenal!  I see endless possibilities of variations in the horizon.  Thanks for sharing this new comfort type food."
2018835,335038,2011-09-27,5,"I get nothing but rave reviews each time I make this soup. Delicious, hearty and healthy."
179133,116697,2009-08-03,4,"This was a very interesting dish - different from other beans and rice dishes I've had, but in a good way. I shredded the carrot and added a little extra sherry & balsamic. It is a little dry, since there is no ""sauce"" to speak of, but the flavor is very nice. Thanks for the recipe!"
191034,310199,2017-02-27,5,"I've been making this recipe now for many years. I can't even say exactly how long. I've lived in my current house now for 11 years and I started making it in my former house. So it's been a while. This is our favorite go to rice recipe. When my girls come home it's the one they always ask for. I have done so much with this rice. I've added beans too it, i've added vegetables to it. I've just done so much. So after all these years I figured it was time to find it online again and give it a rating LOL"
1059677,44938,2010-11-29,5,"Simple. I always hated stuffing until I discovered this recipe! I upped the bread to 16 c., added 1/2 c. of butter, reduced the salt to 2 tsp, dampened with chicken broth, and baked in casserole dishes at 350 for 20-ish minutes. I think next time I'll throw in some poultry seasoning and pork sausage for fun, but it's amazing as is."
1024982,350868,2009-02-04,4,"I just wanna say how much I enjoy your naming of these delish-looking wings. Also, baking is certainly healthier than deep-frying."
2001277533,32204,2017-06-19,5,I found the best brownie recipe!
1252036,32614,2010-11-02,0,This is good . Maybe it is the ease of making that makes people want to rate it so high.  But I don't think it worth 5 stars.  I loved the notes. I let rest 1/2 hour before rolled in sugar and sugar did not melt. I made 1/2 box vanilla betty crocker and 1/2 box devils food duncan hinz I must say the duncan hinz was a lot prettier. Must be partly the reason for instructions specifying devils food. The devils food I used 1/8 c. oil and 1/8 c. applesauce so that would be 1/4 cup each for the whole recipe. I read once it is wise to only substitute applesauce for half of the fat called for.
183964,240220,2007-08-27,5,We loved these cookies... I am partial to PB cookies but Dugan is partial to oatmeal. This is a great recipe that we both enjoyed. It combines both of our favorites.It is crunchy/crisp on the outside(which I love)but chewy(which Dugan loves) Excellent recipe. Just the right combo amount of white and brown sugar. (I had to run my regular white granulated sugar in the processor to make caster sugar) Excellent excellent excellent recipe.
65056,38714,2004-12-02,5,"This turned out quite well, thanks!  I made a half recipe, which worked just fine.  This does have a nice light maple flavor, which is very nice.  I thought the vanilla and maple flavors actually balance really well.  This is very refreshing since its low in fat and not too creamy-creamy.  I found the texture to be just fine- I was just sure not to overcook the pudding on the stovetop.  I served this cold, so I made sure that the pudding when I took it off the stove was about the same texture as pudding from a box (I've never made pudding before!) is before it is refrigerated.  Turned out just right!  I found the amount of cornstarch to be fine- I didn't think this tasted gluey at all...and I didn't have to add more either, although I know that Missy is in Australia, so maybe the potency of cornstarch is different there or something?  I think this is nice because you can cook it more or less in accordance to how thick or think you want your pudding.  Next time I'm going to add some spices or maybe some orange blossom water?  This makes a good light and refreshing snack or dessert that's pretty good for you!  I think this would also work well with soymilk, and it would be vegan then!  Thanks for the recipe."
389683,102274,2012-11-01,5,"I thought I was making this for my husband; I was surprised that I enjoyed it so much!  I didn't change anything, this recipe was perfect."
33159,125825,2007-04-18,5,I am so sorry I made these bars!!  My hubby & I ate the ENTIRE pan over the course of a weekend - I'm so ashamed - but they tasted so amazing!  I only had 1 1/2 cups of oatmeal so I used that and increased the graham crumbs to 1 1/2 cups.  I loved the sweet & salty together.  I didn't bother chopping the peanuts so this recipe was very easy & quick to prepare.  I'm sure these will be on my Christmas trays next year.
581722,25885,2008-01-27,4,I made this recipe in muffin tins and they were great!  Thanks for the recipe.
129333,100380,2005-04-11,5,"Oh man this is GOOD. the Bananas and black beans really go well together. I used a Cuban black beans and rice pre pack. I brazed the chicken in a little wine onions celery and Jamacan Jerk seasoning. adding some of the stuff from the pan to the beans and rice,  I did not use the onions or salsa on top but that sounds good too.  "
168462,208710,2007-02-07,5,"I had a big ham  bone from a spiral ham. So I threw it in the crockpot overnight and the next day added cooked beans and the remaining ingredients, except the lemon juice as I did not have any. I also added 2 diced potatoes. The first day it was good, but the second day i was great. I served it with a little sour cream. Thanks for a great tasting, filling and low fat soup."

225211,29742,2008-04-29,0,"This is an outstanding recipe.  After discovering it a year ago on Cinco De Mayo  day, I practically lived on it the whole summer.  I also took it a few times to cookout dinners with raves from guests.  Men really do love this shrimp cocktail.  I meant to thank you for posting this last year, but it slipped my mind....so Thank You, Mariela"
229882,134820,2009-01-19,5,These are wonderful!!! I've made them numerous times already and my whole family loves them. I use 2% milk instead of cream and only one tbsp of butter in the mix. I also cook these in just olive oil and they always turn out great. Thank you and God Bless.
1763563,148447,2010-12-16,0,These baked up nicely! I also used the jamacian rum and brabdy. They were a hit!
235240,142783,2006-01-20,5,"This turned out perfect, even though the smoke detector went off a couple times!  No guesswork, and when I stuck the thermometer in when it was done, the temp was exactly right!"
2001500552,181181,2017-04-21,1,"We just made these and the best way to describe it is a sweet biscuit. They were dense, tasteless and the oven temperature too high. We threw the batch out. I don't know what the rave is about?"
192830,24088,2008-01-02,5,"Yum! I will definitely keep this around for busy mornings or for meals  on days I don't feel well. I will probably change the recipe around to fit what I have. Bananas, blueberries, etc. I will add ice cubes, though because I like them extra cold. Thanks!"
1679509,484064,2012-07-24,1,Terrible cookies...made them twice to see if it was my error but the flavor was odd at best.
776760,55641,2008-10-31,4,"I love this! Not quite five stars, as it's ""only"" some boiled potatoes, but at the same time, it's a beautiful accompaniment to any mediterranean dish (fish/meat/salad in a tomatoey/herby sauce). You'll especially appreciate this if you've been on your hols to Lanzarote and want to relive some of the memories. Me and my girlfriend have enjoyed these with some chicken and some mojo rojo. Now all that's missing is a balcony and the sunshine!Sadly not present in Manchester, England at the moment!"
4470,162501,2006-08-16,5,"The aroma from this recipe while it is cooking makes you want to stand by the  the oven and ask ""Is it ready yet!""  When it is ready the taste doen't  let you down.  Flavorful, moist, tender chop.  I reduced the recipe to 1 chop but only halved the sauce. I will have the leftover sauce over rice as a side dish.  Thanks PotPie for this delicious recipe"
2400725,252267,2012-09-13,5,"Easy and delicious recipe! Both my husband and I really liked it. Hard to believe it's low fat. While I love all things spicy, I might cut back on the green chiles next time around. Other than that, it was perfect. Even reheated well the next day."
468398,63579,2011-05-08,5,"This is my favorite show stopper recipe...and it's super easy too! My SIL's cousin made this and I had to have the recipe, I fould it here and I made it and this is IT!!!! Make this for the coffee lovers in your life...HUGE HIT!!!!"
283390,180375,2008-10-26,5,"This is one of my favorite lunches to pack, and I've had a few variations of it (sometimes we replace the cucumbers with pickles, for example). This has great texture and a very fresh flavor. I don't seem to get tired of it (and that's saying something, because I don't often repeat recipes). Thanks for sharing this!"
29782,22389,2008-12-16,5,I am sitting here munching on a small bowl full of this as I am typing this review :)    It's delicious!  I added some water chestnuts and some mushrooms and a couple shakes of greek seasoning.  Let set in ref. as stated  and YUM! the results are delicious.  Great to snack on  and to have as a side dish to baked chicken or whatever meat you like.  This is a keeper and one I am sure I will make alot. Thanks for sharing the recipe Derf!
197023,254561,2009-01-17,5,"I made four times the quantity, in order to have lots of meatballs in the freezer for use in other recipes. I used half beef and half a veal/pork blend. I really like the flavour from blended meats and I added 2 packets of frozen, thawed and thoroughly squeeze-dried spinach and some minced garlic but otherwise made these to the recipe. I really love meatballs made in the oven - less oil needed - and I always cook them in mini muffin pans. They don't come out quite ""ball"" shape but it is so much easier to fill the muffin pans than to shape all those balls, particularly if you're making a large quantity. And if you're using silicon pans, the ""balls"" are so easy to remove from the pans too. Thanks for sharing this recipe, bmcnicol. Very tasty, moist meatballs. We enjoyed some with tzatziki, sliced tomato and baby spinach leaves in a ciabatta roll before stashing the rest in the freezer. Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders."
86512,277938,2008-06-15,4,"This is a good drink. A little strong but good. I used Tequila Rose Strawberry Liqueur. A nice combination of flavors. I think next time I make it, I will add more pineapple juice. Thanks for sharing your recippe Amanda. Made for ZWT 4-Greece and the Cafe ZMAKK Gypsies."
232886,107211,2009-09-01,5,"So fast, so easy, and so good in the summer. My whole family loves this salad."
39329,33723,2002-08-12,4,"This is a great recipe to use during the Thanksgiving holidays because you can add leftover turkey to it and call it Turkey Devine because ythat's what it taste like. The word devine is not misspelled. I do change the cheese spread for 2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese because I do not like the cheese spread. To salty for me.

65502,425234,2010-06-14,5,"OUTSTANDING!!!!! This delicious creation was worth the work, no question! I loved the colour from the saffron and the eggs were delicious! For step 4, I strained the chicken mixture and poured the sauce back into the pan. I used a springform pan but it came out easily anyway. I posted a photo of the top of it before I inverted it because it is really pretty. It is easier to cut when it's still quite warm. I didn't use cilantro (blech!), cloves or all of the topping. Made for ZWT6. Thanks CarrolJ! :)"
336058,376779,2010-01-04,5,"I'm rating it a 5 bcz it still turned out great with subbing plain yogurt for the cheese. We're trying to avoid cheese. I tripled it and got 11 4"" pancakes. I think I will add just a bit of stevia next time, but with syrup, it would be fine (we can't have sugar right now either). I also used half brown rice and half buckwheat flour.  UPDATE: This made it into my Top Fav's of 2009 cookbook.  Original Review 7-2-09."
133174,86025,2009-10-18,5,"Even though mine were not pink this is a great basic recipe and I agree with Mrs. Jack, it would be delicious wrapped in a flour tortilla.  I served the eggs with freshly baked biscuits and pickled jalapenos.  Made for *Think Pink Tag* in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness month."
158328,55923,2012-06-23,0,"A favorite!  I have made this several times, the first time for a rehearsal brunch before our son's wedding.  Most recently I substituted half the french bread with half a pound of raisin bread - added nice flavor. LOVE the cream cheese, when served very hot it turns creamy. Nice. Make sure you adjust your baking time if you have refrigerated overnight, I always have to bake it considerably longer than suggested baking time."
199697,84234,2010-07-06,0,OK - CAREFUL when adding spices.  Turmeric is 1/4 not 1/2.  I'm sure I don't have to tell you how I learned THAT?!  Will try again and rate when I make it correctly....Also - would recommend leaving in seeds for jalepeno for at least one of the jalepenos...It could have used a bit more spice IMHO.
1165425,123104,2009-02-11,5,"Absolutely delicious! Add more chili powder and curry if you want a bit more 'kick'. When I try a new recipe in my house, the real test is, ""Well, should I make this again?"" Tonight I got a rousing YES PLEASE!"
487548,120982,2007-04-29,5,Awesome!  I did change the vegetables to what I had on hand and skipped the potato as my main had them in it - but - that sauce is fantastic!  It would be great on Salmon and I think I will even try it on ham sometime.  I will also try it with the potato included
618575,258828,2010-04-19,5,"These were awesome! My 2 year old daughter loves to cook and she was the perfect little helper for these!
They were also delicious, they were just like the ones my mom used to make when i was little! THANKS!"
465056,192825,2007-12-19,4,"Wow the cook up quicker than other cookies.  (I burnt the first batch) they are good though (even the ""burnt"" ones were good)"
446917,67447,2008-07-01,4,"Pretty good! I substituted honey for the sugar, white whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour, and used half apple sauce/half oil. I would cut down on the salt next time, but other than that it turned out moist and delicious. Great combination with the zucchinis and carrots!"
9869,30316,2006-03-12,5,"A different way for us to enjoy pumpkin, I added a little buter before mashing (lite) and some parsely flakes and a little grated cheese.
Thanks Jen."
2001647648,214042,2017-07-29,5,"I also used the recipe, it did need more water, but substituted the flour for oat flour it was delish, so it became wheat free &amp; dairy free, it was a hit for my gym class Today I have changed it slightly, substituted the walnuts for almonds, &amp; added some freshly grated ginger maybe a tablespoon, also added more water but also some evo (extra virgin olive oil) it is in the oven now in muffin tins &amp; smells divine"
901630,115515,2008-07-27,3,Mine came out like hockey puks plus they smelt weird
39334,163666,2008-05-25,5,"Thank you thank you thank you!!! I have been trying to eat healthier, and fried chicken is not on my menu anymore, although it's one of my favorite foods. But now, with this delicious recipe, I can have it again!!  It's got a nice crispy outside and a moist and tender inside. I used a little bit of cayenne pepper too just for a kick, and left the skin on for DH. I served with a salad and plain baked potato and such a delicious, yummy, healthy, easy to make meal!! Thanks again! We will be making this again and again!!"
89831,180616,2008-03-03,5,"very good, I reduced the whipping cream to 1/2 cup and increased the mayo, also I reduced the sugar slightly, I was going to add in the full amount and I'm glad I didn't as i think it would have been a little to sweet, thanks for sharing andother great recipe Sharon!"
860079,282776,2009-08-04,5,"We really enjoyed this tonight for a quick dinner. I strayed by making this on the stove top instead of microwave, using Kittencal's recipe#76616 (#76616) and instead of instant rice I used brown rice ~ just my personal preferences. Very tasty, rib-stickin' meal and I had all the ingredients in the pantry. Thanks bmcnichol :) Made for PRMR, August 2009!"
126440,166528,2016-01-08,5,Loved this on my homemade cinnamon and raisin bagels. I will chop the walnuts smaller next time.
811980,27208,2008-08-11,5,I added carrots and potatoes - increased the water to one cup.  Fantastic taste and delicious gravy!  The children loved it and hubby loved it!!
58104,59209,2003-05-28,5,"My DH & I both enjoyed this! My husband doesn`t eat anything goat!!This is the first time we had this cheese. Expensive $8.00 for 8 ounces!It`s worth it! I bought 2 and froze one. In the salad dressing I also added fresh basil and chopped up cucumbers. LOTS of pepper. The 2 of us ate the whole salad. AND HE doesn`t eat salad!
And all I have to say is put mango in anything and you have a great dish! I also topped it with some sugared pecans! Thanks for for the new cheese experience(to us)."
360730,95569,2006-10-23,5,"Great Great Great! My husband made this since I was running late to work. It turned out great, he loved it and we ate it for 3 days straight. Thanks Kree!"
197023,141888,2005-10-22,5,"A delicious and fairly quick to make soup â it was really tasty both warm and cold â which Iâll be making to take to work lunches a lot during the summer.  This would be just so refreshing â and sustaining â on a hot day!  I followed the recipe exactly, well almost.  I doubled the garlic, and sautÃ©ed it with the onions, and because I didnât know what cutting the spinach âinto chiffonadeâ meant (and with the cooking frenzy of the World Tour, this just wasnât the time to find out!) I simply skipped that instruction.  I can learn what that means at some later stage.  I used two packets of well-thawed and thoroughly squeeze-dried frozen spinach, and two handfuls of baby spinach leaves, and neither really needed chopping anyway.  I used my Vegetable Stock Recipe #135453 (which Iâm tending to use for all recipes requiring stock), and creamy Greek yoghurt.  Next time, I think Iâll add some cumin and some chopped pine nuts.  A fabulous recipe, Kate, which Iâm so pleased to have found!  Thank you for posting it!

"
1803691520,151177,2015-01-22,0,So simple and DELICIOUS! I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil for the marinade. I added onion and red peppers to the stir fry. Served with basmati rice. Also added sesame seeds (along with the green onion) to the final dish and BAM! Major food-gasm! Thanks for sharing! :)
570804,374425,2010-04-27,4,Finally a recipe that is really Irish Champ.    We always peeled the potatoes and also added some parsley. Thanks again for a great contribution.
340141,273015,2008-10-12,5,"This is so good!  I had to use bay scallops because my husband can't read the word ""sea"", and I had forgotten to look.  Anyway, it still turned out delicious.  What I liked the most about this recipe, and the reason why it got the full five stars, is that the flour, oil and lemon juice actually formed a gravy'-like sauce that was so good.  I also think this would be very good wih dry sherry or white wine instead of the lemon juice or as part of the liquid.  Fast, easy and delicious!"
1613267,400468,2010-11-04,5,So simple to make and they turned out absolutely perfect! I will never buy Sandwich Thins at the store again- this is easy and cheap! Thanks for the great recipe!
1670603,67256,2010-08-28,0,"The flavor and moistness of the cake is outstanding and rates five stars, however I'm also having difficulties with the oven temp and time.  I've tried adding 1/4 cup extra flour AND baking for an additional 40 minutes and the center of the cake is still not done.  Any one have suggestions for making this cake perfectly at an elevation of 6300' ??  I would appreciate any feedback."
55647,43646,2002-10-22,3,I cut the bacon in half and drained off most of the bacon fat and the taste of bacon still seemed too intense.  I also thought celery was more appropriate than green pepper. 
748736,117222,2008-05-22,5,"This was a hit at my May 24 Weekend bbq!
I didn't have whole grain mustard so I used regular.
I didn't have fresh thyme, so I used dryed and only about 1 teaspoon.
They were so tasty even the next day when they were cold.  Yes, I did have left overs but thats because I made a lot more.  LOL!"
162826,117464,2008-07-05,5,"This is a AAA burger, Becky!!! I had forgotten that my late DH marinaded our burgers in Worchestershire Sauce before grilling. Loved the bacon addition, too. Used some ground sirloin....mmmm! Perfect for the 4th.
Made for BBQ & Grilling Event in Cooking Photos."
43152,308275,2009-05-22,5,"Great little recipe.  I substituted ""Old Bay"" seasoning for the cayenne pepper.  Another keeper"
498487,257113,2008-05-05,3,"This was incredibly rich! The meringue cookie is wonderfully coffee. I couldn't get stiff dry peaks, perhaps because of all the sugar? After 20min of beating I had stiff/soft peaks and cooked that. It took less than 30min to  cook. I had difficulty serving it though. Because it's two high and very crisp the whipped cream in the center wants to squish out when you try to cut it. I think this would work really well as individual bite sized cookies with a dollop of the whipped cream on top of each."
228241,97760,2006-06-23,5,I had no eggs and we had to have spaghetti n meatballs... I wasn't sure if dijon mustard flavoured meatballs would be good with spahetti sauce but these lil meatballs are a burst of flavour and would taste good with just about anything!!! So good!!! Easy to make!!! Thanks!!! 
2370770,135350,2012-08-20,5,"the comment by jehaas from 2010 was so helpful, especially since I have never made a roux before tonight. It came out amazing! There were ravenous eaters in my home all of the sudden and requests were made to make it again. Even from my hubby, who normally does not like what I cook. Thanks so much for an awesome recipe. This one will go in my personal recipe collection for sure!"
257653,65779,2006-09-26,5,"Terrific recipe!  Fast & Easy.  I've been making this for years.  I ADD 8 bacon strips cooked nice & crispy which I crumble into it.  Thanks for posting, Kree!  :) "
616211,73825,2008-03-13,5,"I made this for the guys at the firehouse and it was a HUGE hit.  They all asked where the second cake was!  I baked it in 2 9"" rounds for about 40 minutes and they turned out perfectly.  This would be a perfect recipe for Easter in a week!"
103876,127255,2005-11-25,5,Thanks for these great directions for preparing scrambled eggs in the microwave.  I am trying to eat more protein for breakfast and this makes it really quick and easy.  I will make this often.
407516,28649,2007-06-09,4,"Very good recipe.  I felt it needed more heat, or maybe my Thai peppers were wimpy.  I added a heaping teaspoon of garlic red chili sauce (which is a good substitute for those without an Oriental market nearby).  Also added a tablespoon of dark soy sauce, as my store brand of fish sauce wasn't quite salty enough.  Thanks for the quick and easy recipe."
107583,60594,2006-10-29,5,"I was pleasantly suprised by this bread.  I have had low-carb bread that was either all air or very rubbery.  This was a nice texture.  I am looking forward to trying the rye version.  I used my bread machine to do the kneading, but did the rising and baking the traditional way, because I don't like square loaves, and my machine is old and I don't think it does a good job of rising anymore.  Time for a new one, I guess!  Thanks for posting this recipe.  As a diabetic, I really appreciate it!"
169515,158398,2006-11-23,5,"This review is long overdue - since Rosh Hashana, in fact. I made one brisket with my usual chili/tomato type sauce and one like this. This one looked too ordinary to be good so I was nervous. It turned out wonderfully, tender, delicious and smelled great when it was cooking. I preferred it to my usual which always gets raves."
166642,277221,2010-02-16,5,This is a delicious and comforting soup! A nice change from the usual broccoli soup. I love the addition of cauliflower. Thanks for sharing!
179545,64001,2007-06-17,5,Brussel sprouts are one vegetable that I tolerated - until I found this recipe.  They are REALLY good this way!  Something in this recipe removes the strong bitterness and makes them a very pleasant side dish.  Thanks!  (The only change I made:  I left out the salt.)
335606,35932,2009-07-22,3,"I'm not sure what happened, because all the reviews are so fabulous, but we didn't like it too much.  Not sure if I added too much club soda or not enough sugar, but it was just tart and bitter.  I had high hopes, but it just didn't work for us.  Thanks anyways!!!"
398964,65387,2007-02-23,5,"This was much easier to make than I thought, and it turned out terrific! I found that the amount dictated in the recipe actually made two slightly smaller cheesecakes in 9"" pans, which worked out great. It was very dense but very, very good. Like some of the other reviewers, I omitted the berries, but I made up for them by sprinkling the unused white chocolate chips in the bottom of the crust before pouring in the cheesecake batter. This was a nice touch. I will be making this cake again!"
28408,41725,2002-12-08,3,I acutally had to throw the first batch of cookies dough down the garbage disposal because it was too soft. I then ran back to the grocery and bought the ingredients again. My cookies just did not turn out.. I loved the filling though
467741,92016,2008-11-17,5,"Super.  Thats all I can say.  Ive made this twice now and its been gobbled up by the next day.  I made a batch one morning and took it into work still warm.  It was gone in seconds.  And like another reviewer stated, the crispy top is heavenly..."
724631,455111,2012-08-20,5,"Light, diet-friendly, easy dinner.  I sprinkled those wonderful curried almonds on top of the chicken when served, was the right time?  With so many ingredients and so many steps, it would help to put the ingredients in the order to be used.  As for the brown rice, I buy a quality brown rice and soak it prior to cooking, and cooked it with defatted broth from Recipe #369106 (which provided great-tasting chicken). <br/>Made for The Wild Bunch for ZWT8's trip to India."
125458,78981,2005-02-23,5,"i knew i HAD to try this recipe as soon as i saw it. i was running out of things to do with cauliflower and this gives it a nice new utility (especially since we don't eat meat we are always looking for interesting new veg dishes). it was the first time i had made a pie with a potato crust, and we loved the hash-brown effect of the crust. the blend of herbs was just delectable (i used all fresh herbs), and the overall taste excellent. only thing i did different was to use one less egg, and i liked it that way. the only downside to this recipe is that it is rather time-consuming, but then, good things come to those who wait. "
213114,103391,2006-10-23,5,Absolutely wonderful! The filling was enough to fill the pie shell and had a generous amount of meringue. Perfect! This goes into my tried and approved and onto my meal calendar as a repeating entry. I have been looking for this recipe for a very long time. Thank you for submitting this one!
560491,411732,2010-02-15,3,"This was good and easy to make, but we found it a little too sweet.  The combination of the pineapple, the onions cooked in the juice and sugar and the sweetness of the BBQ sauce on the pork was a bit much.  Will make again, just need to play around with it to get some of the sweetness toned down.  Made  for New Kids on the Block Tag February 2010."
394592,99395,2007-06-16,5,"Wonderfully delicious!!  This salad has a very special richness to it...The roasted eggplant gives it a buttery quality and the fresh herbs add spectacular flavor.  I loved the play of the sweet, the savory and slight spice of this dish.  I added a bit of onion and used a medium sized green chili because I had them available.  My only problem with the dish was my own fault...my ""assistant"" (he-he) sliced about half of the eggplant too thin before I could stop him...not a real problem...the more ""mushy"" pieces gave additional textural contrast which is always nice.  I loved this salad!!!  I preferred it after it had cooled for about an hour to room temp ...the flavors seemed to have become ""well acquainted"" at that point!!  A definite keeper...one to pull out for events when a nice veggie main course or side dish is called for.  I had made a batch of yogurt cheese to accompany it but ended up enjoying a bowl of it alone!! I Loved this - Thank you very much for sharing!!"
85873,18039,2003-09-24,4,This is a great moist pork roast.
56463,47414,2005-05-29,5,"What a great sandwich! We like tuna, but this is a real treat for lunch. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

229237,34653,2009-07-12,5,when i was first looking at the ingredients of this i wasn't sure how it would be. but it was awesome! we ate it with chips instead of veggies and it was like a creamy salsa. and everyone at the party loved it thanks for posting
720912,117583,2008-06-11,5,"really easy to make and good - taste a little different than regular biscuits --but delish no the less.
thanks for this great recipe"
1357466,94579,2010-04-07,5,Makes a great jelly - Beautiful color - Great Taste!  Very easy recipe.
130663,78625,2005-10-21,5,"This was very tasty,I packed the base tightly and no problems. Next time I think I will add a bit of lemon zest."
1535,152148,2007-03-19,5,"Now *these* are gourmet cookies!! I made them exactly as written, except I did use semi-sweet instead of milk chocolate chips and they were outstanding. I know dried cherries are expensive, but make sure you splurge and get some for this recipe. The only people who tried them and were crazy about them were folks who don't care for cherries much. You could easily sell these for big bucks at a fund raiser! Thanks for posting!!!"

1186940,161178,2010-01-09,5,"This was excellent! I wish I could give it 10 stars, because, I mean, sometimes if you want fried fish, you've got to fry it...but with this recipe I tricked my dear BF--""it's not fried?"" he said. The breading is fantastic--great flavor, stays on the fish, and nice and crispy. After 10 min in the oven I was a little afraid that it wasn't going to turn out crispy, but after turning the fillets and baking for another 10, they were perfect.  I will definitely make this again, with the only potential change being that I may double-bread the fillets.  This breading is just so good, and in my opinion, the crispier the better, and when you're not frying the fish why not double-bread? Thanks for a GREAT recipe!"
2002026166,2886,2018-03-03,0,So basically there's no nutrition at all because it's all sugar! What a ripoff!!
128473,166343,2011-06-22,5,"Awesome muffins Babzy.  I really enjoyed the flavor and texture of these muffins.  What a perfect way to use up leftover ham.  I used a beautiful maple glazed spiral ham, thinly sliced green onions and really old sharp cheddar.  I will be enjoying them again tomorrow for breakfast.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Made for ZWT7 for Witchin Kitchen."
2001392999,109970,2017-06-24,5,"I made these this morning, with excellent results. Very light and fluffy. A few tweaks -- I was almost out of oil, so used 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup melted butter, I added an extra egg, used fat free greek yogurt, and reduced the brown sugar to 1 cup (they were still plenty sweet for me)."
1337577,47844,2009-07-28,5,"This is exactly like grandma always made!! It is one of my favorite dishes and unfortunately one they do not offer in Florida!!! I am originally from Graterford, PA and this is what you got when you ordered dried beef gravy!!!"
310162,102655,2008-06-09,5,For something so simple I have never been able to cook good pikelets (or pancakes) but I have been craving them for days now so decided to try another different recipe. I just have to say that these turned out perfect! They weren't bland like a lot of pikelets can be (I added 1 tspn of vanilla) and they were very light and fluffy and best of all I was able to cook them to perfection without over cooking or under cooking and they didn't fall apart when i flipped them. Thank you Catherine for giving me the ability to enjoy pikelets again :)
138429,115432,2009-07-14,5,"A nice large muffin, perfect in shape, moist, light, wonderful flavor and healthy.  can't get any better then that. A recipe that calls for repeats. Thanks for sharing this great recipe."
196388,10958,2008-01-02,5,"I love this recipe.  I have been making a similar one for years that is only slightly different. I reduce the milk to about 1/2-3/4 cups, depending on the amount of potatoes and I leave out the flour.  I also parboil the potatoes.  I cover it and put in the mic for about 20-30 minutes until cheese is melted and potatoes are cooked.  I used your recipe this time and cooked it in the oven.  It was very good and everyone liked it."

92796,188287,2006-10-02,4,"Made for Pick a Chef '06
Very nice flavor & pretty presentation.  The instructions do not say what to do w/ the soy milk -- so I added it after I pureed the vegetables.  I also added salt & pepper to the sauted shitake mushrooms.  Thanks for the submission -- One other suggestion: change the name of the recipe to identify it as a soup (e.g. Cream of Corn & Leek Soup w/ Shitake Mushrooms)"
4470,70342,2003-09-09,5,"Simple tasty recipe - The beans this year have gone wild and we seem to have them every second night so it is great to have different recipes.  I cut back the oil to just a spray of olive oil, used Bavarian course grain mustard - it is slightly sweet gave a nice flavor to the beans.  Thanks Tebo for a keeper"
133174,47114,2005-07-10,5,This recipe is so close to a recipe that I enjoyed as a child. That recipe was for a lemon cheesecake. This is equally as good with the lime gelatin. I used Neufchatel cheese instead of the regular cream cheese and a sugar free gelatin. Everyone raved about how light and refreshing this was. Thanks 
846829,31128,2008-10-13,4,"It was very good, but the caramel topping was a little bit too sweet for my family."
68357,49216,2003-03-22,5,"Outstanding!  A light flavored casserole that let the flavor of the crab shine through.  I made 2 changes:  used only half of butter called for and substituted skim milk for evaporated milk, as I had no evaporated milk.  I topped casserole with Panko bread crumbs, placed in 9x13x2-inch casserole, and baked about 25 minutes.  This is a winner I'll be making again and again."
75569,280825,2008-01-28,4,"Made this to take to my granddaughter's baptism...and it was a big hit.  I think next time, I'll leave the cookie slices off the top though.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!"
780172,479988,2013-06-29,5,"I am going to give this recipe five stars because the flavor is great. However, I personally had problems with the texture, the outside crunchy layer was great but I didn&#039;t like the creamy insides. My husband did not have this problem and ate his portion and the rest of mine. Love the mix of butter, brown sugar and curry"
297303,17186,2007-10-23,5,I made this one for thanksgiving and christmas last year.  I have had alot of m&c and this is my fave so far.  I believe I did add a little more cheese.  I didn't want to waste what was left.  It's awesome.  Love it!!
169430,95511,2007-07-17,4,"DH ""What have you been into?"". Wife ""Nuffin unny, juss a lil coco""
I used dark Creme de Cacao  because that is what I had on the shelf. This is on the strong side (for me) but it sure is good. I enjoyed mine a 1:00 in the afternoon out on the deck in a lovely little breeze. They take no time to whizz up and are very creamy and super smooth. I used 98% fat free/no sugar added ice cream to cut the fat and sugar  and make it a bit more diabetic friendly."
1580907,95330,2011-07-03,5,"100% delicious! My partner made this due to the fact that he loves vegetarian lasagne and it was totally amazing! We are both omnivores and eat anything, however I was slightly concerned I would notice the lack of meat in this, but when I tasted it I loved the flavour! The portabella mushrooms add a really nice ""meatiness"" to the dish. I love the fact that we didn't have to bother making a cheese sauce and my partner described the use of egg to bind the ingredients as ""genius"". We loved it so much that we have no plans to make any other type of lasagne for a long time - we can't get enough of this one! We have added it to our shopping list for this week. It is also a very cheap/health-conscious meal to make as the cheese goes a long way and you can substitute the cheeses for low fat versions which is what we have done. Cannot praise this enough!"
600761,37580,2007-10-23,4,"This was a yummy recipe that my kids loved, as did my husband and me.  I didn't have any apple juice, so I used water and the muffins were still sweet enough. I used 1/2 cup of frozen corn kernels. Next time, I might use 1 tbsp. less of the sugar.

The muffins were very easy to make and I will definitely make them again -- no more boxed corn muffin mix for me!"
42504,155743,2010-08-02,4,The flavors are great but it was too spicy for me (my husband didn't think so).  I'll definitely make this again but next time I'll cut the red pepper flakes by half.
542615,2886,2014-12-29,5,This is delicious! There is one thing I always do when baking any type of dessert bread is to dip a knife into vegetable oil &amp; cut a slit down the center of the loaf before baking. I finally found a GREAT recipe for banana bread!
2000192532,27210,2015-05-15,5,"This was definitely a KEEPER! I don&#039;t like pork chops, but my family raved about the sauce! I actually put some of the sauce on the hamburger I made for myself in lieu of ketchup and that made my hamburger taste phenomal! Wonderful!"
558439,108775,2007-08-20,5,This was absolutely fantastic. I made it with panko breadcrumbs and it came out light and crunchy and had great flavor from the honey/mustard mix. This was very quick to put together and I will be making this again and again!
102058,135181,2006-07-10,2,"Bluemoon.... I relied REALLY havily on Ellies review to help me make this, You are missing a quantity of water in the choc mousse section,  water , galatin and cream in the mint mousse section and since this recipe got printed out on the shopping list, and I read the review *afterwards* I was scraping to have enough cream to get the recipe together.
I too used galatin in sachets, 1 each for the mousse and or the mint mousse and niether was anywhere set. The mint mouse was actually still really liquid and the ganache, which I spooned carefully on top floated on it. I did make this in one large bowl, but did it the day before guests arrived so that it would have lots of extra setting time. What a total shame that the whole thing was like soup, it tasted great though and after guests had had a try and a laugh I took it to the kitchen, used the blended to mix the mint layer into the rest really well, and put it into the freezer as improvised icecream. I haven't tried that, but DH says it's good :) I guess what is most dissapointing of all is that Ellies review was made a while ago and you haven't managed to fix the recipe for us. I'd appreciate it if you could becuase it's got a great taste, but the making of it is so totally frustating that at the moment it completely puts me off making this again. Thanks for a recipe with potential :)"
362983,63355,2014-03-05,5,"Very easy and delicious. I did not have savory; so I substituted with marjoram. I also used frozen mixed vegetables, which made things a little faster. Thanks so much!"
1222615,272158,2009-12-22,5,"killer!!!  I made one tray to use on the cookie plates we give the neighbors and after my picky daughter reluctantly tasted one, she begged me to make another so we have some for ourselves.  Since these are so quick to make I did make another, despite the last minute Christmas rush.  Happy Holidays and thanks for a terrific recipe."
126440,154432,2010-06-30,5,"Loved the dressing.  I did add more veggies and part of Recipe #213026.  I did also add cabbage, bean sprouts, and cilantro."
2001364054,333655,2017-01-23,5,Interesting... I was typing up a for a family cookbook recipe I made when I was a child for peanut butter pinwheel cookies that I made in Iowa in the late 1960's. I was looking for a similar recipe because the oven temperature and cooking time was missing from the my recipe. This is the exact same recipe! And HINT: use shortening not butter or margarine or the cookies fail.
705251,281644,2012-06-13,5,This recipe was a HUGE hit with my family and friends (and don't forget me!).  The flavors are outstanding and it comes together so quickly.  For a party I'd say you get more like 8-10 servings per recipe when you are doubling/tripling the recipe.  Scrumptious!!
2001646762,23189,2017-07-28,2,Not impressed at all. Not a good flavor and not really muffin-like at all. Won't be making these again.
198154,101383,2012-01-13,5,"If you don't have candy canes, make this anyway! My guests came early and <br/>I didn't have time to chop up the candy canes so I just left them off.  I still got lots of praise and several request for the recipe.  We will be making this again!"
98192,38739,2003-08-24,5,Very Good and easy to make. Have you ever tried adding refried beans?
296809,170171,2006-07-30,5,"Had dinner w/friends tonite, took your cake for dessert & was a huge hit! Even after a hearty meal & generous servings of cake, 3 of the guys had 2nd's. I made it in a 10-in rd deep pyrex baking dish & it was done 10 min ahead of sched in my convection oven. I did opt out of the glaze, dusted the turned out cake w/powd sugar & added choc shavings. A lovely, dense & moist cake, duck. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us."
705251,423907,2010-07-11,5,A recipe cannot get any simpler than this.  I love recipes that take little work and give you a punch of flavor!  Everyone loved this - even my DD who is not generally fond of anything with vinegar. :)  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Went to the Market Tag Game :)
115758,205185,2007-06-07,5,"WOW...the aroma of this spice mix is TDF. I used it with recipe #230031 and it was fantastic. I can't wait to try out more recipes using this divine spice mix. (skipped on the optional ing this time)
Reviewed for ZWT3...thanks for sharing!"
1182971,76043,2011-04-08,5,"This is a great recipe!  I have made it twice now, and once with barley instead of rice.  Thanks!"
1087573,336247,2008-12-20,5,"I was looking for a sweet potato dish to replace my old sweet potatos that I serve every year. I did a trial run with this recipe a couple of weeks ago and I wont ever go back! For the last 15 years my kids have refused to eat any kind of sweet potato; not even candied yams. After a little coaxing I got them to try this and THEY LOVED IT!!! I plan on cutting back just a little on the sugar, because it is very sweet, and adding a little cinnamon next time."
200862,377558,2012-10-28,5,"Deb, this was SO great, in two ways: time was short and this is a quick recipe -- and I was short of fresh veggies for dinner. But I had lovely ripe tomatoes, the cheeses, the herbs, gorgeous fresh garlic -- and phyllo which needed using up pretty quickly as I'd kept it in the fridge too long already. I hate posting a picture, because NO photo will come close to French Tart's, but I also feel I want to show you how nicely it came out!! Apart from the phyllo (no time to make pastry, and no ready-made at hand) I added 1 beaten egg to the flavoured cheeses. This firmed up the bottom beautifully. I'd hoped that with only 2 eaters I could save half the pie for today -- but DH left only slightly more than a slice in the plate!! The flavours were wonderful! This was a perfect side dish with a roast chicken, potatoes, and a salad. Thanks for a winner, with that gorgeous French-style simplicity I love. Please edit your photos so that FT's is again the default!!"
95743,26389,2005-02-22,5,Beautiful and delicious way to present the potato.  I made half the potatoes and used half the dry spices as a dry rub for a pork tenderloin.  They both roasted at the same time and we enjoyed a great meal with minimal effort.
1468814,409598,2010-03-09,5,"This was so easy, quick, and delicious!  My husband and I both loved it!  Thanks!"
2329244,449407,2014-05-20,5,This is a great recipe! I made a couple of substitutions. I omitted the sugar and used a little bit of red onion in lieu of scallions. My DH and I loved it! Thanks for sharing.
2900633,26059,2013-07-13,1,"After reading the reviews on this recipe I thought I would try it on some fresh caught catfish. Please note that this recipe is very very salty, I even did not use all the salt the recipe called for. Very surprised on how others rated this recipe. I would suggest not to add salt as this recipe should be very tasty if you do that."
418366,260107,2009-11-07,5,"Ive made this recipe several times now.  Its closest to the one my grandmother used to make and far superior to the one I had been using.

A trick I have learned recently:  If you spray your dough hook with Pam the dough will not stick to it as much and wont come over the top of the hook"
289292,186352,2008-07-14,5,So easy and wonderful! I used Turkey Italian Sausage and my 6 year old and I loved it.
510313,306057,2008-06-03,5,"Made & reviewed for ZWT 4 ~Kumquat's Kookin Kaboodles! I used to eat this when I lived & worked in East Germany, so was more than pleased to try this recipe ;) I halved the recipe & followed the instructions - the end result was perfect juicy meatballs (called FRIKADELLEN), light spaetzle & a lovely rich sauce. Thanks Ravenseyes for a delicious recipe which brings back great memories!"
29655,155106,2006-10-29,5,"AMBROSIA ... cool name for cookbook; fitting name for this dish!  Quick, Easy, and DELICIOUS!  These disappeared almost before I had a chance to taste them!  A definite winner.  To save time I tossed them in a heated, oiled wok then tossed in a bit of water. Done in 5 minutes! Just enough time to mix up the sauce.  Thanks for a keeper!"
1155036,491858,2018-09-18,5,I made this as the recipe called for but added quartered red potatoes and a quartered large yellow onion. This was amazingly great!!!
1035087,16902,2010-04-28,5,"Delicious! Followed the recipe until at the end looked like it was too thick and would not make a lot of gravy/liquid so I added 1 cup +/- of chicken stock. PERFECT! Great gravy for mashed, noodles anything. Thanx for your sharing."
685886,102681,2012-03-12,5,"Forgot to add my stars, in the original post.  Definitely 5!!!"
104877,16512,2008-03-06,5,I served your Lemony Rice Pilaf with a roast leg of lamb and Spinach Salad. Dessert of Peach Shortcake. The Rice Pilaf complemented my Sunday Dinner with friends very nicely. It is now tucked away with my own Almond Rice that I normally do. Thank you for a great lemon tasting Rice Pilaf. I made it as you recommend as well.
323186,224738,2009-02-09,5,"Very good and very easy.Takes no time at all, and gives a lovely spicy twist to beans, which combined with the cashew nuts is totally delectable!
I didn't use the coconut because I don't like it, sorry about that,  but we really enjoyed this and I will definitely be making it again, I could have made twice as much and still have had no leftovers! 

Made for Aussie/NZ swap #25, February 09"
2002310062,9506,2018-10-23,5,"I first made this casserole in high school home ec. Now I'm a grandmother and am visiting my son and family. I hadn't made this in awhile and needed my recipe which is at home. Thanks to you, I found it here! Looking forward to dinner!"
1803690019,33721,2015-07-03,2,"i thought it was alright, but no one in my family liked it at all, not even a 3 year old, its very dense and one dimensional, yes i used good chocolate"
321555,38249,2006-07-10,5,"Everyone loved this meatloaf. I used the aluminimum foil trick as well, but I only used 2 strips and it lifted out easily. The guys especially liked the sauce. Thanks for a keeper!"
133174,224132,2007-07-02,5,"This was made for the Zingo round of ZWT.  It is very close to what I have been doing for years.  I used a chuck roast, my recipe #89857 and added some cabbage to the pot.  The liquid was reduced to 1 1/2 cups.  The broth was thickened with arrowroot starch and made a wonderful gravy to serve over the meat."
2922829,375737,2013-07-29,5,So simple and so easy! Delicious and crispy!
209255,92683,2007-06-08,4,The kids really enjoyed these!  The adults however felt that the base cookie was a bit lacking in flavour.  The marshmallow and icing were perfect though!  I think I will take the idea of the marshmallow and the recipe for the icing and put it on a different cookie base.  The only thing I changed was to sub in 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour instead of all white.  These look lovely on a tray as well.  Your directions are GREAT!  I loved having your comments through out it.  It helped me not get worried when I added the milk.  Thanks!
437991,370627,2009-05-20,4,"These are quickly made and nice for guests but not too sweet. Next time i would like to make them with almonds instead of pecans. Thank you for sharing, made for ZWT5"
2001282764,296969,2017-03-13,0,Love this recipe! Thick &amp; cheesy! Not skimpy or dry.
2000478076,325037,2015-09-16,5,The picture looks terrible but these cookies are lemony good! They are always the first of the goodies gone! Light and fluffy.
163112,411880,2012-06-25,4,Absolutely delicious!  I barely got a taste. ;) The fruit salad is huge.  I wonder if regular tapioca might be better than quick?  I'm testing that now & am waiting to see...regular is way more time intensive.  I have plenty of fruit left for a second batch of pudding.  A lovely combo of flavors.  The tapioca is delicious.  I'll post back when I know if regular tapioca is worth the effort.  Made for Aussie Swap 6/12.  eta:  The long cooking tapioca is NOT significantly better than quick especially  considering cooking time.  Happy eating!
42366,33489,2003-01-04,5,This is excellent!!  Thanks!
189643,33527,2005-02-02,5,"I am completely impressed with how this dish looks and tastes! I had made some homemade ravioli and was not in the mood for red tomato sauce, so I decided to try this-which is now my favorite way to eat ravioli!!! The only change I made was to use white wine (again, not in a red mood). Thank you for this excellent recipe Chris! "
542159,215689,2009-09-24,5,Oh Sam! This is sooo good. I cut the recipe in half and made in custard cups. This is so much healthier then baked apple crisp. The dates and walnuts complement the apples so well. This just moved into our favorites book. Thanks so much for the post.
280271,334142,2009-08-27,4,"We enjoyed this but thought there was something missing...like a spice, sage, thyme, oregano not sure what but it lacked the wow I was hoping for. It's very easy to prepare and the chicken was nice and moist. Overall a really good dish. I served it with recipe #360824. Thanks for posting. :)"
1595619,67777,2017-08-05,5,"I make this alllll the time. Sometimes I use more chipotles because we have a pretty high tolerance. I bake chicken thighs or legs, heat the sauce in a large skillet serve over on a bed of white rice. Family loves it as much as I do. Usually serve with a fresh green salad as a starter. Yum!!!"
6357,64146,2003-06-10,5,"I had made this yesterday in my blender using 1 cup yoghurt, 1 medium cucumber(washed, unpeeled and sliced), juice of 1/4 lemon, 1/4 tbsp. mint leaves and 1/2 tbsp. dried marjoram. I did leave out the garlic, though, since I don't like it all that much and also because I was wondering how it would taste uncooked. This was amazingly refreshing and tasted really nice especially in this scorching summer heat. Ofcourse, I had it as a soup(watery as it was blended). It was really really enjoyable. An A+ recipe!"
14410,214118,2010-01-07,5,"Delicious! I didn't have cheerios, but I wanted to use up some languishing boxes of cereal. I had some Cinnamon Toast Crunch, some Corn Pops, and some Reeses choc/pb cereal, which I combined to make two cups, then crushed. For applesauce, I used two single serving cups of strawberry-applesauce. Smelled great while baking, came out nice and tender, and so good! I'll probably never be able to duplicate the exact ratio and type of leftover cereals, but I will definitely keep this recipe close at hand."
222055,167305,2006-09-25,5,"This pie really is so good! I was just going to have ONE bite in order to rate, I had to eat the WHOLE slice. I wouldn't mind eating the WHOLE PIE! 
I do admit and don't know how much it changed the pie, I didn't have enough clear karo and had to fill my cup with the dark. I ended up with a little more dark than lite. If someone thinks it makes a tremendous difference, I will be glad to make it again. But at this point, with my change, I am still going to give it 5 stars. YUMMY!!!!
Thank you for a wonderful pie recipe!"
153919,172264,2006-06-17,5,"This is very good.  My DH claimed it is much better than egg bakes and is even good reheated!  Used 2% milk, chicken sausage, and I omitted the chilies.  Great recipe!"
1679777,332009,2015-04-23,5,This is a great recipe which is flexible. We love veggies here so I trippled the veggies &amp; just compensated by making extra sauce. I also used brown rice &amp; substituted Ancient Grains Croutons which I crushed for the bread crumbs so my dish also was gluten free. This seasoning combo is fantastic. I split the recipe into 2 8 x 8 dishes &amp; froze the 2nd one which we had for dinner tonight. My husband &amp; I both loved it! Just a heads up however; if you use brown rice you will have to cook it in the fluids longer before putting in your casserole dish than the 20 min given in the recipe. We learned this the hard way on the 1st one. It was still delicious the rice just could of been slightly more tender. The 2nd one I froze from the same batch was slightly more tender I assume since it had been sitting in the sauce cooling before I put it in the freezer. I will cook my brown rice in the sauce mix next time for probably 30 minutes before putting in my baking dishes to insure that our rice is fully cooked. I would say the sauce and the vegetable blend here is flexible enough that you could change the seasoning to have many casseroles with different flavor themes you and your family enjoy. Just be a little creative!

1075452,179050,2011-01-26,4,"Overall this was a good chicken dish. It definately made the house smell better than the chicken tasted. Not so much that I'll be rushing to make it again, but it was a good one time try. If I did it again I would definately use chicken breasts!"
717221,83083,2013-09-30,1,"Sorry, but the custard did not set enough, the pudding just fell apart while serving - disappointing considering there&#039;s quite a bit of work / time standing and stirring, etc involved. I also found the directions in steps 1 and 2 a bit vague - I really struggled to get a lump-free custard. This was incredibly, over-the-top sweet for me."
224088,6964,2010-09-28,4,"We liked these.  Very nice with soup.  I made them with half whole wheat and half white flour.  The Parmesan taste was subtle.  I didn't especially like the sweetness (though the hubby didn't notice it.)  If I make these again (and I probably will), I'll eliminate the sugar and increase the cheese to 1/3 of a cup for a stronger Parmesan flavor. Thanks for the recipe!"
58430,50338,2004-02-04,5,"This is so easy and versatile. I have made it several times now for an easy nutritious lunch. I make with frozen veggies for added nutrition. For those not on weight watchers I totally reccommend topping with chopped avocado before serving, it really adds a burst of flavor. "
102058,182428,2007-01-26,3,"Definiately a recipe for real garlic lovers, which fortunately we are, as this a recipe small on quantity of end result but BIG on packing in a LOT of flavour into a very small amount. I had one major problem: the paste that I forced though the sieve didn't want to mix much with the olive oil... I tried with a fork, a spoon and a stick blender and it still didn't want to mix. I would therefore call this more of an oil than a spread. Hubby requested pasta for dinner so I decided against having this with bread and mixed a good tablespoon of the garlic puree and another tablespoon of the oil into a large bowl of spagetti... Hubby said it was nice but didn't give any further views and *didn't* say he didn't like it.... since he rates pasta and all dressings/sauces and oils on it rather severely I would say that yes, I would definiately make this again... but that it hasn't quite made the monthly favourite list and I think that every few months this would make a welcome appearance in a pasta dish. If you are a garlic lover, the house smelled devine when making this.. my neighbour stood our front door at the other end of the house and commented on the lovely smell wafting though the hall. Please see my rating system: a great recipes for now and again, expecially when we really fancy a garlic fix. Thanks!"
2342238,64639,2012-07-25,5,"Gotta say, This recipe was great. But what mostly got me was the sauce. I changed it a little though. We didn't have any Soy Sauce, so instead, we used Hot Sauce to spice it up, along with some red pepper and black pepper. See, now down south, we deep fry A LOT of things, so instead of baking the chicken, drop it in a deep fryer, and make sure the sauce stays on a low heat. As soon as you fish the wings outta the fryer, drop em in the sauce and roll them around a bit and then put them on a plate and cover em with aluminum foil and let them set for a few minutes. keepin them covered will allow the heat to cook them inside just a little more and allow the sauce to thicken a little. This sauce.... I saved it and I put it on everything meant. Hamburgers, hot dogs, cooked spam. it makes everything amazing. thanks for the recipie."
240958,13619,2006-05-20,5,once again very good! I tried it with half butter and half lard as well as all butter and found the all butter crust the best very flacky and very good flavor
89831,167757,2006-10-23,5,"Being Greek-born I really enjoyed this recipe, I increased the onions to 6 medium. Thanks for sharing Katia!...Kitten:)"
125458,53914,2004-12-22,3,"i must be the outcast here cause i really didnt like this as much as the others did. the only reason i am giving it 3* is cause my husband seemed to enjoy it a lot. for me, the mayo was the downer here - it came across far too strongly although i had hoped, after seeing the other reviews, that it wld assimilate better with the other flavors. unfortunately, i wont be making this again "
973916,249683,2009-06-04,3,"I made these last night, and wasn't thrilled. I could barely taste the balsamic vinegar, I felt they were under seasoned, and they weren't visually appealing. I also found that they needed 30 - 35 minutes to roast to be tender. My boyfriend said he liked them; however, I will not be making this again."
671644,226408,2009-12-24,5,"SOOO good, I don't think I'll ever be able to eat plain eggs again. Thanks for the recipe! =)"
721965,228463,2008-02-13,4,"Made it word for word with my wife. It was good, and especially great to get that Buffalo flavor without the fried chicken. Its hard to pair sides with. It is kind of its own meal. I guess it would be good with a salad. It was a very nice change from our usual menu. I would make for football games in the future, but probably not a main course for dinner."
799733,48075,2008-08-06,1,I found it somewhat bland and not at all worth the effort (including clean-up) involved.
765130,363374,2014-08-23,5,Awesome recipe. I made this just as the recipe said and it turned out wonderful. No one could tell that it was gluten free.
66246,10958,2007-01-07,5,Served this with a spiral ham tonight.  I added a little grated cheese on top (kids love it with cheese).  Thanks for posting.
69925,107786,2013-04-21,5,My gas grill keep blowing out so I decided to cook my ribs this way.  OMG! They feel off the bone and my husband said this was keeper.  Very very tasty.
1802817888,448861,2018-05-31,1,"Making the recipe as posted without any changes are as follows: The skin was soft and slimy coming out of the crockpot. It was way too salty. Didn't care for the smoky flavor in the chicken and gravy (ruined it for me). The meat was dry after cooking on low for only 6 hours, so the timing was completely wrong! It fell apart trying to lift it out of the crockpot, when I thought I was going to be able to present a whole sliced chicken on the table (had company coming). It looked pretty gross on the platter! I would not make this again. It was embarrassing to serve this to company!"
666682,105670,2010-04-11,5,"Yummy! The only thing I did differently was instead of shredding cheddar, I made long slices and placed it on top of the cream cheese so it wouldn't escape. I didn't precook the bacon or even place the poppers on a rack to cook, I just placed them straight on a lined baking sheet and it was great, the bacon grease just ran to the corner of the baking sheet. Next time I will leave some seeds/ribs on the jalapenos for more spice."
152195,115462,2007-01-26,4,"Yum!  I used about 15 lasagna noodles, used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella, and left out the parsley and my husband and I both loved it.  Thanks for posting!"
135287,46110,2005-10-04,5,"Really enjoyed this recipe. I put it all in the foil, sealed it up tight and put it on my barbeque for abou 90 minutes on medium-low. Turned out great."
155675,303132,2011-01-08,0,These were absolutely delicious!  I halved the recipe and omitted the coffee in the glaze.  So good!  I love pioneer woman...she has some great recipes!
209991,293794,2012-12-06,5,"Thank you for your recipe.  The cookies were really delicious, especially with a cup of hot tea.<br/>They were very tender (I stirred the flour and nuts in as suggested and did so as little and as gently as possible). They were also so nice and buttery (I used unsalted butter, but did include the small amount of salt in the recipe).<br/>Although I barely squeezed one tsp of vanilla from my almost empty bottle, it seemed to be  enough for me because it allowed the buttery flavor to dominate.. <br/>My oven runs a little hot, so I baked my lbarely 1 inch balls at 325 for 10 minutes and they were set up nicely and stayed light in color.<br/>Your advice to roll twice is right on.  When I was packing them in my tin, I couldn't resist sprinkling more over the tops using a sieve!"
176615,176753,2009-04-16,4,"Very sweet and very crunchy. Quick and easy to make. For my tastes, I preferred this as a topping for yogurt to reduce the sweetness. Lots of healthy fats, and because it tastes like yummy oatmeal cookies, would be a great granola for kids. Thanks for sharing the recipe! Made for PAC Spring 2009."
21487,28537,2002-07-10,5,"Fantastic Heatherfeather...I used frozen (hate to admit that) calamari and just made the sauce but oh man, it was good. My DS loves calamari and he raved about this! Thank you!"
149415,128558,2006-11-27,4,"I would have given it 5 stars if it were called ""Sherry Bundt Cake"". It is very good, but isn't a pound cake. This is light and fluffy and didn't have the dense quality of a pound cake. That aside, we all really liked it. I made a vanilla/brandy drizzle to put on top (ran out of sherry or would have made vanilla/sherry). It is easy to make and will be a good item to bring to bake sales, potlucks....."
953193,332513,2009-03-08,5,"These cookies are sooo yummy!  I do not like pumpkin whatsoever, but these were a great alternative to pumpkin pie.  I also added some semi sweet chocolate chips, but found that it took away from the taste, so I added an extra 1/2 cup of pumpkin and they were awesome."
226863,487059,2012-11-29,5,"I love arugula and spicy lettuces, so just knew I would love this!  I used honey glazed pecans instead of walnuts because that is what I had on hand.  Really enjoyed the pepperoni in this....I'd never of though of adding that!  The dressing is just perfect.  Thanks for sharing!  Made for the Aussie Reunion tag game."
129958,20379,2011-10-13,5,"10/30/05:  This is wonderful!  I used red pepper instead of green as that is what I had on hand.  I could eat my weight in this?!!  That would be a lot of soup!! LOL!  This will be on my menu alot with the coming cold weather!  Thanks MizzNezz!  12/13/10, just wanted to add that I made this soup quite often and it is a very ""forgiving"" recipe.  Sometimes I don't have some of the ingredients or not enough and I just use what I have and it is wonderful everytime.  We are expecting snow/rain mix in a couple of days and I have just made another pot of this soup.  Delicious!  (10/13/11 - just realized I forgot to add the stars! I still make this quite often)"
416684,210436,2010-07-04,5,"I followed recipe exactly and give it 5 stars, but my dh & family only give it one....but only because they just like plain old beet greens.  I on the other hand, thought they were a great change, and much like a braised green, but with a wonderful flavor. Thanks for posting!"
185446,23170,2006-04-21,4,A simple & tasty potato change.
188744,95222,2005-03-02,5,I just made this again and liked it even more the 2nd time around. Can't imagine it withOUT the ketchup - I would keep it in the recipe. Definately one of 'Zaar's BEST.
329586,8782,2006-10-21,5,"Wow! Talk about delicious!...and about as easy as you can get! My Dad is 78 years old, who reported, ""I think this is the best chicken I've ever eaten!"" I would say that sums it up. :-) "
916847,36232,2008-08-08,4,"The cookies are great. They are certainly cakey, but I think that's a plus. I used dark chocolate Raisinets instead of plain raisins."
107583,223154,2007-06-03,5,"Very tasty!  I used more Splenda and less sugar for dietary reasons, but turned out great.  Going to try with prune puree for a dark bar next time.  Thanks for re-doing the original recipe to make it healthier!"
498271,271871,2009-04-07,5,What a delightful treat!  I halved the recipe and got 8 good-sized biscuits.  The honey flavor really shines through in these and the cinnamon is just the right touch.  I had mine with butter and just loved them - thanks for posting this recipe!  Made for Spring PAC 2009
1084840,215790,2010-04-30,5,"I will say I did a 1/2 and 1/2 cheese  mix of mozzarella and cheddar, i do NOT recommend it, I have rated this a 5 because I could see and taste how good it would have been with out my mix. Plus it got my picky son and husband to eat broccoli. I will make this again."
1348477,97196,2009-09-22,5,"Yummy! We made this last week and just opened the first jar. I won't drain so long next time because we like a little juice in our salsa, but still very good."
1616063,140660,2010-10-14,5,OH MY!!! I made these this morning after i popped them in the fridge overnight and they were INCREDIBLE! My boyfriend just absolutely loved them and was ecstatic to find out I had more in the freezer(= Will def make these often!
1522687,84545,2010-01-15,5,"Absolutely perfect!  I'm a KitchenAid newbie, and this recipe was ideal for family pizza night.  I just turned my oven on to its lowest setting while the dough was kneading, then turned it off once it was in the bowl, to help it rise.  Will defintely make again!"
2241340,477055,2012-04-17,5,"Wow this is the best cebiche I have ever tried, I ended up using habaneros for a little bit of spice I also added octopus and calamari like your picture. Thanks."
610698,127868,2008-03-24,5,"Really, really, really good- must keep the onions!  Even the people who hated onions loved this, as the flavor of them completely change the taste of the burger! Definately try this one!"
486648,186729,2011-11-07,5,"I've made this sauce a couple of times and it is fantastic! One-half ounce meatballs make an excellent appetizer, but I make it a meal by doubling the sauce, adding about 30 1-ounce meatballs and simmering it all together while I make up some bulgur to serve the meatballs on top of (we have a crowd to feed around here!). I don't keep onion salt on hand, so I used 1/2 onion powder and 1/2 salt. I also only had cider vinegar one time, and couldn't taste a difference. Delicious, different recipe Gerry. Thanks for sharing!!"
59969,14606,2003-12-07,3,Basically taseteless.
181231,123883,2005-05-31,5,I grew up eating this salad every summer.My husband also loves this salad.P.S. I have enjoyed reading alot of your recipes grandma 2969 and can tell you are a great cook and most take me down memory lane. Thanks
242642,99636,2005-09-20,5,This worked so well with something I used to always throw away.  I added a handful of cinammon red hot candies to give it a gorgeous amber color and just a hint of spice.  Great stuff!  Big hit with my in laws and 3 year old son too.
1505896,77920,2010-01-01,4,"This was a great, easy recipe!  I cut up plain bagels to dip in it and it was perfect.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I thought it was waaaayyyy too garlicy (and I LOVE garlic).  Next time, I would add about a tsp. of garlic.   Then it is a 5 star recipe for sure!!"
323389,35393,2009-08-24,4,I think my strawberries were not quite ripe enough to make this... the muffins were good but could have been  more flavorful.  I sprinkled some raw sugar over the top before baking also.
69267,309610,2008-12-30,5,"Thanks for the recipe! I could not remember how I used to make cooked apples...I had about 8 gala that were about to go bad, so I used those. The kids loved them, so did my dh-delicious!"
361931,138482,2009-10-04,4,"I really liked the pork chops, and the sauce was just okay...  Though it did keep the pork chops nice and moist, there was a flavor I would want to change just a little bit -- either the brown mustard or the honey, not sure.  I will play around and see what I can come up with.  Thanks for sharing!"
422449,149424,2007-01-03,1,"I tried this for New Year's dinner and it sounded great! BUT there are a few things wrong!
  1  The cooking time is completely inadequate! I actually went a bit over on the times and a 14 oz Muscovy breast was still running RED juices and was as tough as shoe leather - It needs to be COOKED!! and that ""Gamey"" thing doesn't exist with domestic ducks!
  2 I don't know how you'd get the marinade to boil down to 1/2 cup! The only way I could get it to reduce was to use a very high boil and boil it over on the stove top creating a bit of a cleanup! Tasted great, though!!
 3 When I took the leftover duck and simmered it for about 1 1/2 to 2 hrs in Red Wine it became really tender and tasty! And, now I can have a good duck sandwich!"
51011,114271,2006-06-17,5,"Yummmmmmm!  Halved this tonight for my dh and I- Dh usually isn't big on dishes like this, but he ate every bite I gave him :).  No changes except to add a bit of butter to the potatoes, and used 1/8 cup of onions.  Thanks for sharing!"
109365,43852,2007-11-23,4,"Easy, wonderful. I used lemon peel instead of lemon juice, and cranberry-strawberry jam. I baked the cookies without jam, then filled them while still hot (they turn out nicer that way, I think). Drizzled with white chocolate when cooled. Beautiful cookie. Thanks!"
2001696823,68280,2017-09-01,5,Very similar to the recipe my Cajun mother-n-law taught me years ago. Am making it now. A cross between yours and hers. Can't wait to sink my teeth into it.
199848,69220,2007-08-02,5,"Great (and colorful) picnic salad.  As written in the intro, I added 3 chopped hard-boiled eggs.  I used the red onions, and the lesser amount of peas listed.  For the medium tomato, I halved a handful of grape tomatoes because I think they slice nicer/neater.  I subbed reduced fat sour cream for the yogurt without a problem.  This recipe is a keeper......thanx!"
346860,249457,2013-07-16,5,"So fresh and delicious. I added a bit more cilantro and did not add any of the jalapeno seeds (this time!) due to the request of my mild mannered dinner guests. ;0) &lt;br/&gt;The jalapenos simply give it really good flavor- without the heat- and the chili powder is a great addition without being over powering. DELICIOUS salsa that can easily be tweaked to your desired heat. Will definitely make this again and again! ***UPDATE: Have now made this salsa a number of times WITH the jalapenos and their seeds- LOVE it!!!! Try it with my recipe: Pintos and Blacks! So, so, sooooo good! Thanks for the BEST salsa recipe out there!"
1406799,472383,2012-07-06,5,"I love this recipe! Thanks for posting. I used it for a lot of my cake mix needs, i love that i know exactly whats in it, plus it's extremely cheap to make. Even cheaper than buying the box mix itself at the store. I've used it on the recipe Funfetti cookies #93732. I love it! Thanks again for posting, this is my go-to cake mix recipe now."
2001435020,33919,2017-03-26,5,"I'm typing this as I'm eating but I didn't want to forget, so I'm writing it now. My husbands exact words after his first bite, &quot;Oh my god, Ashley, this is fantastic! I'm actually hoping the kids don't like theirs now&quot; *laughing*. I never make casseroles so it threw me off a bit that you put the sour cream mixture on the bottom. I had to reread it like 10 times to convince myself that yes, that is indeed what it said. I followed the recipe to the T except for one thing; I greased the dish because I know how cheese can be without it. We loved it and will be making again soon, and doubling up for leftover lunches."
46190388,78814,2014-11-21,5,"A super easy and delectable recipe that sticks to your ribs! I used a rotisserie chicken and because of reviewer comments about the onions not being completely cooked through, substituted cream cheese with chives as well as onion powder instead of adding onions to the filling. As others mentioned, I also decided to add a vegetable to the filling - a bag of thawed, frozen spinach in cream sauce. I didn&#039;t have a problem with soggy crescents since I baked them without the sauce and served it on the side instead. I will certainly make this again, maybe switching up meat, soup, cheese and a different vegetable. That&#039;s another beautiful thing about this recipe - it&#039;s awesome as is, but lends itself nicely to adjustments and variations depending on what your family likes! I&#039;ve never met a Kittencalskitchen recipe I didn&#039;t like - Thanks so much Kitten, for another fabulous recipe!!"
623462,31300,2008-10-27,5,"THIS IS A WINNER!! It is EASY, healthy, a little different to serve, and is well received. (When I was a child my aunt used to make this salad.) I am so glad I found this recipe so that I can make it myself. My husband really likes it too. I served this salad last week as part of my buffet for a large party of 60 people. Be sure you make at least the night before for flavors to perfect. I add a couple of diced hard-boiled eggs too! Thanks for sharing recipe."
2008910,247150,2012-10-30,5,This was absolutly delicious. I flash froze mine. Then heated them up about 2 days later for a weekday meal. The ingredients only cost about $4.00 and great to keep in the freezer. My husband and I are going to add refried beans and make burritos with this recipe as well.
135470,335544,2010-01-10,5,"This was quite rich and delicious. I used extra brut cocao powder, 2 TBLS of caramel apple dip and 1 TBLS of sugar - the cocoa is very intense and needed more sugar and even with this amount was not very sweet. I used a mix of about 1/3 half and half and 2/3 non-fat milk, no schnapps and added a  1/2 tsp of vanilla. For the caramel on top I used more of the dip heated very briefly in the microwave with a touch of 1/2 & 1/2 to make it drizzleable, and Kosher salt. I love salt caramels and the touch of salt here is perfect with the intense chocolate, though I might add more carmel next time.  For me this amount was enough for 2 servings. Made for Winter 2010 Comfort Cafe"
107135,104052,2005-07-27,5,thanks  for posting this im always  looking for  good breakfast sausage and this is one  thank you for posting  and thanks for your kind review
519548,53516,2007-07-12,5,"Ummmmmmm ........ Wonderful flavor 
I GIVE IT **** 10 STARS."
128473,368987,2009-09-11,5,"Another winner from Deantini.  I loved this wonderful bruschetta. It was easy to make and was simply devine.  I didn't change a thing, it was perfect as written.  Loved the combo of brie, mushroom and rosemary. Kudos on a great treat, that I will make often."
2000055872,271888,2015-03-11,5,My Family loved this dish! Dinner originally was supposed to be spaghetti but realized I had no tomato sauce. I substituted broccoli  with green bean because that&#039;s what was in my fridge. I will definitely be cooking this again.
195988,145755,2006-01-25,5,"This was very yummy. Not too sweet, so if you like sweets, add more sugar. It reminded me of a breakfast food because of how the oatmeal got nice and thick. Thanks for posting!"
2123645,360805,2013-09-26,5,Very helpful! We should find time more often to celebrate with champagne!
89831,149658,2006-01-27,5,"This recipe has all of my favorite ingredients!I just made this in my oven on low heat, sauteed the onions and fresh garlic (in place of garlic powder) with 2 teaspoons cayenne, used chicken broth in place of water, and also cubed the chicken and browned first, also I increased the olives. Very tasty dish, thanks Geema!...Kitten:)"
114974,82925,2008-02-24,5,Excellent!
877529,268001,2009-10-12,5,"This soup has an excellent flavor and I love the quantity of vegetables it contains.  However, for some reason it seemed like it needed more liquid so I ended up adding an extra cup of water and I used an entire cup of cream. I wasn't sure when to add the cream so I added it to the stuff you boil separately at the end. I also throw it in the blender after cooking. The smell of the veggies cooking was not very pleasant in my opinion so we were pleasantly surprised by the end product. Turmeric = palillo"
837152,4447,2008-09-28,5,"I used 5 butterfingers in all.  I used the last 2 for the top over the Vanilla ice cream.  I chose to use French Vanilla.  Also, between the layers I used hot fudge. and chopped pecans.  The ultimate dessert!"
121690,40269,2005-12-03,5,"Having read Evelyn's comments I did not drain the beans before adding. I also used 2 cloves garlic, minced, in place of the garlic powder, adding the garlic with the chopped onion. This made an extremely easy, chili-style supper accented by the smoky saltiness of the bacon. Nice!"
227779,99558,2006-11-09,4,"I really liked these muffins.  I was looking for oatmeal muffins, but saw peanutbutter was an ingrediant and could not resist.  I will keep looking for an oatmeal muffin, but this is my peanut butter recipe.
I used old fashioned oatmeal."
383346,438353,2013-08-25,5,It was my first time doing and tasting preserved lemon and it&#039;s great.  I used it in 2 recipes and it adds so much flavor.  I will be doing it often :)  Thanks threeovens :)  Made for ZWT9
116137,2496,2010-06-06,1,I know that I'm in the minority but this recipe did not work out for me at all.  I made 48 mini cupcakes and 12 regular sized with this recipe and they turned out hard as a rock and crumbly.  I couldn't even get the paper wrappers off of them.  I didn't care for the flavor. That might have been the cocoa I used but I tend to think not as it tastes great when I make Recipe #32204.  I ended up throwing it all away and scraping my pans because of the overflow.  This may turn out if you are making a pan cake but I do not recommend it for cupcakes.
572166,22782,2008-02-13,5,"I've been looking for a good spaghetti sauce recipe using sausage rather than ground beef, or a combination of both, and finally found it! I made this last weekend and it was absolutely delicious.  After reading a few reviews, I decided to use 1 lb.of sausage and 1 of ground round.  My husband likes the sausage cooked in its casing, sliced in 1/2 in.pieces and then added to the sauce, so I cooked two additional sausages and added them to the sauce as well.  Like me, he gave it 5 stars and we'll definitely have it again.  Thanks, Sharlene, for a wonderful recipe!"
62264,374751,2009-05-28,0,"Was going to post this same recipe I received from www.Chow.com! Thank you for posting - I'll write a review when our garden starts making the peppers, tomatoes & cilantro. This seems like an ideal Sunday brunch dish!"
55578,94077,2006-03-09,4,"I cut the breasts into slices and cooked them that way.  Good, DS liked the little extra kick."
87023,90904,2004-09-26,4,"Very tasty, I used frozen mint peas in the recipe and I think the mint added something to the salmon cakes.  As we dont have Mrs dash here I made up Mrs Dash Seasoning recipe no.20729 and used it and it all turned out fine, but can't say if that seasoning is the right one, but as long as the taste was fine, its good."
231507,372766,2015-03-28,5,"DH loves this salad dressing.  That&#039;s rare, he is picky.  So easy to prepare, and a change from the &quot;usual&quot; lettuce salad with ranch dressing that he usually likes. Thanks for posting!"
1348891,23480,2009-08-18,5,"I made this cake over the weekend to bring to a housewarming party. OMG, I barely got a piece. It went so fast!! Everyone loved it. It was so moist and perfect for a 98 degree day (ugh). I will definately be making this cake again reallllly soon. Thanks so much for posting!!"
332843,404335,2010-01-19,5,My MIL (Indian) makes this and it is to die for--and much simpler than a lot of other Indian cooking.  :)  This is one of my favorite side dishes.
597362,341572,2013-10-28,5,Love this! I add spinach or kale the pasta also. Some times I add a dash of salt and garlic powder. Its even good with a splash of white wine. I had never tried a gorgonzola sauce and I had some at a really nice Italian restaurant and this was the closest recipe to that one that I have found.
2001409375,180645,2017-11-29,0,Remember Big Boy? They still have one in Sandusky Michigan . I always get the Slim Jim w/fries ?
1233170,84474,2009-04-10,5,this was delicious!  it is filling and definitely can be a meal on its own.  i served with warm naan.
104295,61154,2006-06-19,5,"The kids loved these.  I used whole wheat bread, unsweetened applesauce, and a lot less butter.  The kids really enjoyed it, especially the cinnamon sugar over the top.  Since I controlled the amounts, I found this to be a relatively healthy mid morning snack."
715550,187317,2009-07-06,4,My husband and I liked this.  Next time I aill add some soy and ginger I think.  I love sauces with honey for glaze.
1800054678,37336,2013-10-09,3,This dish is very easy to make and it&#039;s totally great for a quick dinner after work. I saut&eacute;ed some veggies to go along with the chicken. It was quite nice! I also butterflied the chicken breasts before coating them to get more flavors from the goodies. Good recipe!
2001293952,17316,2017-03-01,5,"Fruit is already very sweet naturally, so I only added 2 tablespoons of sugar to the fruit instead of 1 and a 1/4 cups. This recipe does not need so much sugar! And then another 1 cup in the batter?! I also reduced this to 1/4 cup, and it was quite sweet enough. For the sprinkle on top, I substituted coconut for the sugar. The mix of blueberries with peaches was delicious, and I'll definitely make it again."
350750,16521,2010-01-27,5,This was really good! I added italian seasonings to plain can of tomatoes.  Also used 2 pork chops and left everything else the same.  Thanks for a great easy dinner.
1363063,38678,2010-06-23,5,Parsley's beautiful photo prompted me to try this recipe and I'm glad I did!  It is already in my Tried and True recipe collection.  Thanks Parsley and Kate!
868012,250167,2009-03-05,5,soo good! just add a lil vanilla to make perfect! will make again
2001254748,224294,2016-11-19,5,"This is my go to recipe for impressing dinner guests, it is ALWAYS a huge hit and they turn out perfect every time. THey get Devoured - never any leftovers!!! It has spoiled us for ordering crab cakes out because we prefer these to any I've ordered out."
603504,126575,2009-09-16,4,I'm from the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Grew up eating cajun food. I doubled this recipe which yielded quite a few cakes. I thought the cakes were alittle bland but then my expectations may have been a little too high. I'll definately try this recipe again in the future along with lot more seasonings & spice. Thanks for sharing a great recipe with all on Recipezaar. Smiles!
2193903,89204,2012-02-25,5,This recipe was awesome! My husband and I really enjoyed it!
1439429,271213,2009-11-07,2,"This recipe was easy to prepare and the flavor was awesome, but 30 ounces of pumpkin was too much.  I put the muffins in a bowl and the next morning they were sitting in a wet goo.  So, I tried the recipe again using 15 ounces of pumpkin and they turned out perfect."
357272,57885,2009-09-05,4,"I didn't use the grenadine and had only had about a Tbsp of pineapple juice but it really does have an after taste of almond joy!! Strong drink by my standards, though. I might try using the Malibu in some chocolate milk sometime, now!"
279989,324512,2008-10-16,5,This coffee was the perfect pick me up this afternoon.  It had a great flavor and I love white chocolate and coffee so this was just perfect for me.  I didn't use the liqueur.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Prepared for PAC Fall/2008.
135344,95530,2008-05-21,4,Pretty good.....I used a blush wine and  my wife and boys really liked it........Thanks for a great recipe
168416,56297,2006-09-21,5,"I think this was the best chili I've ever had. Although I had to alter it a bit for 'the fussy' man (he likes it very thick). I used 1 can of sauce, omitted the water, used about a cup of fresh onions instead of dried, added a cup of green peppers, used fresh minced garlic and threw it all in the crock pot on high for about 5-6 hrs. I thought it was just the perfect amount of heat but I think next time I will cut down just a bit on the cayene & chili powder per 'his' preferences. But, I now have finally found my chili recipe and will look no further!! Thanks PanNan! "
281399,237566,2008-09-08,5,"This is the perfect slushie! So easy to make. I used about 2 tbsp less sugar that called for in the recipe and it was just the right sweetness for us. I used cherry flavored koolaid pkg. Thanks for sharing this recipe, one I will be making again in the future!"
371798,32566,2008-08-09,5,Made these potatoes with skin on. Excellent flavor with a crispy outer coat. Had to bake it a little longer than the stated 20 + 15 mins as they were pretty thick potatoes. Served it with a ribeye steak and baked beans. Will definitely make again.
97780,92110,2004-10-03,4,"Easy, tasty chops.  I have kind of phobia about pan fried chops so I just browned them and put them aside to make the sauce.  Then I added them back to the pan until they were cooked through.  I was a little worried that they would be too strong but they were tender and sweet."
37449,62854,2004-02-09,5,"Oh boy, was this delicious! I loved the liquid smoke flavor.I halved the recipe and have sauce leftover so will just have to make it again! I found at the last second that I was out of brown sugar, so I subbed white sugar with some molasses added. Worked just fine. Thanks keen, for a yummy recipe that I will definately use again!!!"
2001570127,182136,2017-06-05,4,"This is VERY close. Next time I'll cut the garlic and salt in half (the garlic was overpowering for me). I used tomatillo salsa instead of the green chiles, and chopped everything in the food processor before adding to the ranch/mayo/milk mixture. I also wanted it slightly less spicy, so I cut back to 2/3 cup of jalapenos."
383346,176927,2008-08-17,5,I used only 1 cup of sugar.  DH tasted it and he said it was not sweet.  Perfect.  The way we like it.  I used butter.  I had frozen blueberries that I tossed in the 1 tbs of flour.  We like it like that without the glaze.  The cake is very moist.  Thanks Redsie.  Made for Zaar Star Game
248414,98783,2006-12-23,5,This is a real star of a recipe! Incredibly easy and everyone loves it!  I also made it without the nuts and grated extra  orange zest on top.
2506183,448335,2012-11-17,5,2 lbs. of medium prawns.  I made this after I saw the show years ago and it's amazing!!!  Even better the second day and beyond.
141293,139231,2006-03-30,5,It's buttery - It's scotchie - It's REAL butterscotch.  Perfect over vanilla ice cream.  Simplicity at its best!
1316860,165750,2011-05-15,5,"These sticky buns are really good. I did change a few things. I used rhubarb AND strawberries and mixed them together with the brown sugar. I didn't use the butter in the crumble - didn't need it. I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp orange zest, and 1/4 cup orange juice to the batter. Orange goes amazingly well with rhubarb and strawberries. I also used plain Greek yogurt instead of cream. These sticky buns turned out EXCELLENT!"
206722,102274,2008-01-01,4,"I make it just a little thinner by not pureeing quite as much of the beans. Also, I skip the salt and use sodium free vegetable stock."
176615,121064,2011-04-03,5,Very good and a simple healthy side dish. Will definitely use again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
2000456505,141983,2018-05-12,5,"This was the most awesome sauce I've ever made. I only made it once, and for it being my first time, I didn't stray from the recipe. It turned out great. Next time however; I am going to take some of the tips given in the comments and try them. The two that stood out were the addition of a dry white wine and 1/2 a cup of either cream cheese or gorgonzola. Both were suggested and both were given good reviews. There was only one thing about cooking it that I had to do... one recipe wasn't enough to feed my family of 5 but a double recipe was just perfect. Also you should note that when refrigerating leftovers, it does solidify but reheating does bring it back to a sauce. Only, the one thing I noticed was that when reheating, the butter separated from the sauce. But it blended back in when I mixed it with a whisk. All around an awesome recipe. :)"
921766,95601,2008-08-13,0,"My husband is a picky eater, but when I fixed him this dish he said it was great food. I add this dish on my recipe.. Thanks Marie, for sharing the recipe. I give FIVE STARS!!"
502504,3400,2008-07-27,5,Ecellent and easy.  I used Baby Swiss in place of the parmesan.  So good.  Thanks for sharing. JCC
158446,166100,2006-08-24,5,I really liked this recipe. It was fairly easy to make and the combination of flavors was delicious.  I will definitely add this recipe to my repertoire although I might cut back slightly on the red pepper flakes next time.
2226031,321625,2014-11-27,0,"I also grew up in Muskegon with the tasty treats called &#039;Polish Roses.&#039;  My mother always made them using what I believe she called chipped beef.  This is actually my first time to make them and since I always paid less attention to the construction than the taste, and since mom is no longer here to ask, I came looking for the details. But can one really go wrong?"
286566,308355,2009-04-20,5,"I do believe this became the star at dinner tonight served with a simple grilled fish fillet and steamed vegetables and was thoroughly enjoyed by all 3 diners - we did pig out and ate all 4 serves between us.  Thank you morgainegeiser, made for Everyday is a Holiday."
161265,135325,2006-11-21,5,I was just coming to enter this recipe and here it is!  We love ham cooked this way...and it is very easy to do.  I will admit to liking using Dr. Pepper over Coca Cola or Pepsi!  Very easy and very tasty!
496315,78014,2007-10-15,4,"This was a good roast, very tender.  Next time I will probably add some Italian spices in addition to the Italian salad dressing mix for a little more flavor, but I did enjoy it though.  Thank you for sharing."
26278,21022,2002-03-04,5,"We are so happy to find this recipe.  It is my daughter's favorite and when she lost her copy she was so disappointed.  Thanks, Tarynne!!"
185365,204882,2009-04-26,5,"Truly a fabulous recipe.  My boyfriend groans when I say chicken for dinner -- until he sees that it's THIS chicken (he's not the chicken lover I am).  Tasty, nutritious and healthy, too!  Thank you so much, Doc, for posting and sharing this recipe.  It's our favorite outdoor-cooked chicken recipe!"
2002201855,128679,2018-06-29,5,This was one recipe chosen from several barbeque choices that was a unanimous homerun! This will be the centerpiece of offerings for an important summer event this July and my &quot;go to&quot; for WOW factor Thank you.
1803759087,474021,2015-02-08,0,"yes, very good !"
142380,414309,2010-02-25,5,"Oh My! These little gems were fabulous! Forcontaining NO butter/margarine or flour, they were amazingly tastey and rather healthy to boot. I did use splenda brown sugar blend rather than regular brown sugar. I also did 12 cookies as the recipe directed and for the other 12 I added a 1/4 tsp vanilla and a drop of almond  extract,  2T mini choc chips and 2T finely chopped walnuts...these were also just fabulous. I will be making these ALL the time as I don't feel guilty giving these to the family. Thanks for such a great contribution, it's truly appreciated~"
2239165,51083,2014-03-28,5,This was on Point....all I did different was add a extra teaspoon of lemon topping...we Loved it
61660,292710,2009-06-01,5,"Great sandwich!  I don't have a panini press so I just used a good ol' skillet to grill these in.  I don't enjoy olives so I used a fig spread in place of the tapenade, it was a great choice!  The fig and brie were great compliments to the ham!  Made for Las Mistico Magicos Sirenas -  ZWT5."
250812,249216,2011-01-15,5,"I love artichokes, but have always just boiled them. This recipe makes the artichokes perfect. I love the garlic in this, it really adds great flavor. <br/>Thank You for posting."
197023,178221,2008-11-29,5,"Delicious pie: with some, one could say, ""old-fashioned ingredients"", namely the onions and carrots and, with the garlic and wine, some most definitely NOT old-fashioned ingredients. I doubled the garlic (we love our garlic) added a leek (I just love onions, garlic and leek together) and added some Greek yoghurt to the mashed potatoes to make them creamy but otherwise made this exactly to the recipe. Loved the herbs selected, the blend of flavours and the potato topping. I made 4 smaller pies, one which we enjoyed immensely for tonight's dinner. The other three are in the freezer to be enjoyed on other nights. Thank you for posting this recipe, lazyme."
172749,12354,2004-11-26,5,"I wanted to bring something different than a pie or cake  to our family Thanksgiving dinner, so I made this recipe with just a little more caramel. I didn't have a ring mold, but used a non-stick bundt pan (2 qt)stuck the bundt pan in an ice chest, let it set on the ice for about 4 hours. When it was time for dessert, I gently ran a knife around the edge of the flan, flipped it over on large plate, filled the center hole with sliced naval oranges and it was a ""Kodak moment""  It was very well received, so light and delicately tasting. Perfect to cleanse the palate after the heavy traditional Thanksgiving fare."
60989,182770,2007-07-23,5,Very good. A great comfort dish that doesn't heat up the kitchen. I added in some carrots to make it a complete meal. Thanks!
1576657,8739,2012-06-25,5,"I have made this a few times for parties, and it always disappears so fast! Great tasting and easy."
166651,57631,2004-11-07,4,"While I thought this was very tasty my housemates just thought it was ""nice"". I used honey-baked ham and mozarella and I'm glad I did because I think it would have been way too salty for me with the prosciutto. I followed this up with your Strawberry Mousse (#62067)for a nice light dessert. "
424680,386537,2010-06-07,5,"Made this to serve with pork chops the other day & IT IS WONDERFUL! The only change I made was to cut back on the jalapeno peppers (personal preference), but had enough in there so we knew it, for sure! This is definitely a great way to serve up this tart red berry! Thanks for the keeper! [Made & reviewed for one of my groupmates in the Aus/NZ Recipe Swap #41]"
1007259,130244,2009-02-16,5,"Even as a clumsy beginner cook, mine came out just as pretty as in the photos!  Amazing!  The only thing I changed was to use fresh parsley (1 tbsp) because I needed to use some up.  I'll definitely use the canned biscuits to make other empanadas, that's a great technique.  My husband's exact words: ""these are weird, but they're good!"""
1438513,58942,2009-11-06,0,"Absolutely fabulous, I just made them and they were fantastic, however I did make some slight adjustments, because I read the reviews and everyone said they were bland so I substistuted Lawry's in place of the regular salt and garlic salt instead of the powder and omitted the msg"
240552,170876,2007-09-08,5,"This was wonderful!  I even used it for recipe #70239 and got rave reviews!  Thank you, Kzim4!"
781392,109481,2008-06-11,5,"This was a great recipe.  I used it more as a guideline since I did not have whole wheat pastry flour, only bread flour .  They worked like a charm and saved me from heading out to the grocery store.  I made a half recipe.  I've only ever had the tortillas with fat and other ingredients that needed the raising period.  These had that nice fresh taste rather than the store bought stale taste.  My husband heated up the stuff to make soft tacos in the time it took to make these with my stand mixer!  Nice recipe."
1456162,198837,2012-12-25,4,"The final meal was WONDERFUL however, the total cook time was WAY off. Common sense tells you that you cannot cook a roast, potatoes and carrots in 5 hours. It took about 10 hours to get it ""fallin' to pieces"". All in all.....a great recipe !"
691183,313426,2008-07-14,5,Big hit at dinner time! So easy to make. Great as leftovers the next day as well.
381180,290582,2008-03-07,0,COMMENT:  Is this a joke?  Seems like a waste of space on Zaar without instructions ~ guess the Chef can edit later if this is a real recipe!
58038,70774,2005-12-10,4,"Nice cookie without being too sweet.  I did have difficulty incorporating in the pecans (and I used only 1 1/4C) and rolling into logs.  Once the dough was chilled, they cut easily and baked well.  Thanks."
47892,408281,2011-01-06,5,"Easy! Drizzled on a very basic salad of mixed greens, radish, carrots, cukes and raisins. Why do people buy vinaigrette dressing? Sherry wine vinegar replaced champagne because I was completely out of the former. Reviewed for Veg Tag January."
1347173,416098,2010-03-25,5,"Made this for my hubby who loves french toast. It was a hit! He told me to put it on the list for guests. I did use real maple syrup and regular vanilla soymilk, still low cal and fat. Thanks for sharing!"
226066,213477,2007-03-17,5,Wow!  What a great way to use zucchinis!!  Loved this!!  Made as is and it came out perfect!  Next time I will try it with Dijon mustard instead of prepared mustard for a nice little kick!  thanks Lazyme!
103876,100408,2005-06-20,5,Wow!  I'm impressed.  These turned out really great!  I used about 1/2 the salt and pepper(s) and the flavor turned out perfect for my tastes.  I made up an egg in my egg ring after cooking the sausage and ate it all on a toasted english muffin with some maple syrup.  Kind of like McDonald's McGriddle.  It was mighty fine.  I will definitely make these again and again.  Thanks for posting!
498271,363230,2011-03-16,4,"Boy this is a tasty dessert!  To me not really a bread pudding, since there's no egg or milk in it, but delicious just the same.  The orange juice gave this a fresh flavor that worked well with the other ingredients.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!  Made for Spring Pick-A-Chef 2011"
527607,459231,2015-07-30,5,"I loved this, it was a wonderful lunch and so simple to make.  Thank you so much"
911964,233295,2009-06-05,4,"This was pretty good, I love the creme brulee but the mango was wierd. It tasted fine, but the texture didn't blend well with the creme. Regardless, it was really good. Also I think that you should put more turbinado sugar on the top, it wasn't enough to create the hard ""glass"" layer, it was just a bit of crisp on the top. I think I'll make this again without the mango. :] Made for ZWT5."
47510,81698,2006-07-05,5,I added in some seedless raspberry preserves and this was to die for!  I had to substitute almond and vanilla flavoring as essence was not available.  Thank you for sharing this delightful recipe!
335737,216954,2007-03-24,5,Oh my how wonderful! A great recipe! And another low carb one.. thank you!
177933,83475,2008-03-14,5,"This was just wonderful...smells so fantastic and tastes just as great as it smells!  I did make some modifications.  It was just for the two of us so I only used 3 chicken breasts and the full amount of most everything else.  I used only 2 tbl. of sesame oil because I am watching calories and it worked out great.  I used splenda brown sugar blend and used half of what is called for because splenda is super sweet.  I also only had about a cup of basil, so that's all I used and really it seemed perfect.  I used 3 tsp. of sambal oelek for the serrano peppers because it is heat I can count on.  We loved the sweet and spicy taste, all of the flavors melded so wonderfully together and all that garlic is really a must, don't skimp on it really.  Next time I might try omitting the sugar completely and using medium sweet soy (Kecap Manis) for the soy sauce.  I think the kecap manis will make the sweetness a little more mild and the sauce a little stickier and thicker consistancy.  Thanks we will be making this again and again!"
682409,162765,2007-12-09,5,Excellent....was my first time to try spaghetti squash.  The thinly sliced garlic head slices came out so brown and nice. They were a great  addition to the sauce that I prepared.  As we are on a low-fat diet I very quickly sprayed the inside of the squash with a combination of canola and olive oils . Took me a bit longer to cook the squash as I live at a high altitude.  I'm looking forward to using the leftovers spaghetti squash later in the week; I'll try them as patties and serve with a lovely green salad.  Thank you so much
426903,126082,2009-02-15,5,"We stayed in for Valentine's Day and had this, and it was very close to the real thing. I only wish we had access to some of the dipping sauces they provided. Our fondue pot is a little large, so I think we need to double the recipe next time so that the liquid goes over the meats to fully cook. I also used a cabernet wine. It worked great, thanks for posting!"
102526,80086,2007-04-26,2,"We thought this dish was ok. My husband only had one serving. It is quick and easy and has few ingredients, which is nice."
138162,108522,2007-04-13,5,Ok when I read this recipe I had to try it...and I did!! WOW for me this is the only way to eat a grilled cheese!!! Thanks for the recipe. Chefsteveo
1307164,66763,2009-10-19,5,yum yum yumm!! i didn't have my brown suger firmly packed and i think i over did it with the olive oil... instead of 2 tablespoons it was more like 4. I don't know why. and i had lots of mushrooms that were going to go bad if i didnt use them and boy was i glad i did! i cant imagine this plate without them! either way it was extremely delicious! i did add some maizena (cornstarch i think?) at the end to thicken it up for my mashed potatoes. thank you maeeast!
1123955,129539,2009-02-06,5,"Very good, my significant other even asked for more. I reduced the fat and cholesterol to nearly zero by using skim milk, non-fat cheese and egg-beaters. The other thing I liked about this recipe is its flexibility to add additional ingredients ie; chopped jalapenos, white corn, green pepper etc. Well done."
1122161,168578,2011-01-02,3,"I agree with another reviewer that this tasted like it was missing something. Maybe since it dosent have the egg that normal cakes have. It reminded me of a ""depression"" cake that they used to make during the war when dairy was hard to come by. I did enjoy it thougth and it was nice to make such a small serving size, but I just don't think i will make it again. Thanks for posting."
354465,29155,2006-10-31,2,"I've made this recipe twice now and both times I followed this recipe exactly, except that I added vanilla to my batter. I thought the batter was really thin and the pancakes were much thiner than I thought they would be. So I added about 4-5 Tbps. of more flour to thicken the batter and then they came out fluffy. All of my ingredients were fresh, I made sure to not overbeat the batter and I thought the first time that maybe I didn't let the batter sit long enough to give the baking powder enough time to react so I made sure to do that the second time but I had the same problem. I think there is too much liquid for the amount of dry ingredients so my batter comes out too thin. After I doctored it I thought they came out ok. They tasted fine but I just prefer my pancakes to be alot thicker. But Thank You for sharing!"
1223919,126611,2009-10-04,5,"Very good. Loved the artichokes. They really made it! 

Didn't need to serve 10 so I cut out the noodles. Easy to make and a great crowd-pleaser."
1800935766,173004,2013-12-30,4,it was good. maybe my issue was that i used brown long grain rice instead of white. my guests loved it.
609460,70646,2007-10-12,5,"Love,Love, Love this recipe!!!!! Extremely moist, flavorful and easy! It was a great hit at a potluck at work. I did add 1 Tbl sp of vanilla extract. Keep an eye on the baking time- mine was don in 40 mins."
199207,67256,2007-08-07,5,"I followed the recipe exactly as posted, it came out great.  Thanks for the recipe"
1530600,200296,2010-04-09,5,"""Delicious!""  That is what my 6 year old said - and I have to agree!  :)  I used 1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs and 1/2 cup Italian breadcrumbs.  I cooked the chicken in my oven on my broiling pan - since I don't have a baking rack - and it worked really well.  The juices drained into the bottom and the chicken remained crispy.  I will be making this again!  :)"
317631,31683,2009-08-03,5,"My impression when looking over the ingredients was there wasn't much (besides salt) to accent the taste of the vegetables. So I added a chicken bullion cube to the milk, and also stirred in a blend of Italian seasonings, which included sage. My first thought when taking my first bite? Omigod - this is vegetable STUFFING! Really, just like stuffing at Thanksgiving, except instead of just bread and herbs and whatever other things some people put in, it's chock-a-block with vegetables. I think I would have found it a bit on the bland side if I hadn't included the extras that I did. As it was, it was really tasty comfort food. With all the cheese in there, I think you could also decrease (perhaps even omit?) the margarine. Shall try that next time and see how it turns out. In any case, I will probably even up the sage a bit - love that unexpected little savoury taste of Thanksgiving."
162285,25216,2005-02-02,4,"The recipe was easy to make, but I adjusted the garlic. It was a little to overpowering for my taste. I also left off the cilantro and recaito. It was still very good and something different to do with broccoli."
452940,181235,2008-06-29,4,"Buddha made the brownie portion while I (Bird) made the cheesecake portion. The directions are simple to follow and easy to prepare. The brownie flavor of this recipe is excellent (I would add nuts though) as is the cheesecake. We did feel that these would taste better as two seperate recipes though, as they both have excellent flavor but as one dessert together, they lose something. We would also like to note that although there are no almonds in the recipe, the flavor from the extract comes thru quite nicely."
65056,91525,2004-08-26,5,"Very tasty basic recipe for tea, Fay!  I was able to get Assam tea leaves, but I'm not sure if they were CTC or not.  Lovely flavor.  The quanity of milk was just about perfect for my taste, although I would prefer 1-1 1/2 tsp sugar (I used 2 1/2 actually, just because I know I like a less sweet tea but I wanted to try and stay true to the recipe).  I began the recipe with the tea in a tea ball, but then dumped it into the water because I felt it was not infusing properly.  Most of the leaves sat at the bottom of the pot anyway as I poured it out, but I strained the rest of the tea leaves out using my french press.  BF is still raving about how much he enjoyed his cup- I will surely use this method again!  Thanks  Fay!  :D  "
2000213722,94907,2015-05-20,2,The only thing that made this edible was dipping it in ketchup
594923,270920,2008-04-27,5,"Wow! This certainly was different. My boyfriend thought I was mad when he saw me cooking rice to make bread with. I halved the recipe to just make 1 loaf and used 1 cup of cooked rice, 1/2 cup raisins, 1/2 cup dates and 1/4 cup sunflower seeds. For spice I used a tsp of cinnamon. This is absolutely delicious. It took about 45 minutes to cook but that's because I accidentally set it to 170C rather than 180C!"
312612,53503,2007-07-27,5,"WOW!  This was so easy and the best marinade I've had in YEARS! I added about 1 1/2 tsp. of seasame oil before I measured the olive oil.  Gave it a great nutty flavor!  I did peppers, onion, portabellas (out of this world!) and zuchinni, marinated overnight, and grilled on each veggie on it's own skewer, then took the veggies off and served them in a pretty bowl.  My guests went crazy over these and ate every bit of them!  This is definitely a KEEPER!"
2001978743,194400,2018-02-07,5,"Wow, this is a fantastic recipe.. my husband said it was some of the best chicken he's ever had! I appreciate how simple this was to make as well. I did grate up more cheese to add in with the mix (I used the Corn Flake breadcrumbs) &amp; also sprinkled the cheese on top of each tender. I had just ran out of zip lock baggies so I used a wide bowl for the mixture and then, pressed each tender one by one into mix to really get a nice thick coat on them. I baked at 450&deg; for about 10 minutes each side. Thanks a lot for posting this recipe! I was standing in my kitchen trying to decide how I was going to prepare the chicken tenders I was staring at when I Googled and thankfully found this! A++++"
2854405,130623,2013-06-07,5,"I made a profile, just to rate this frosting. Yes, it is that good. It has a luscious, smooth and fluffy texture, thanks to the whipping cream. For those who say it is too sweet, yes, with an overly sweet cake/cupcake, I suppose it would be. My favorite pairing for this is a white cupcake with a tart fresh raspberry puree filling. The tart filling and frosting are a match made in heaven! I would also like to note that I have made a milk chocolate frosting using this exact same recipe with a milk chocolate baking bar. I did have to add a tbsp of cocoa to amp up the chocolate a bit, but it made an incredible milk chocolate frosting as well Thanks Kittencal, simply amazing!"
2000985881,265314,2016-04-24,5,"That was very good.  Its completely gone now. It was enough to feed 3 adults. I added in some chopped up onion (1/2 of an onion) to the egg and some garlic before i poured it over the dripped buttered bread. I also half cooked 3 hashbrown patties (just to brown and unfreeze them) I cut them up and shredded them over the egg mixture. I also had some round sausage patties that i cut up and spreaded over the whole. One more barely layer of that cut up bread remains, drizzled the butter and added the cheese. It was gone in less than 10 minutes!!!"
1227673,135350,2009-04-05,5,oh so yummy!  my new go to recipe for family functions.  Thanks for posting! :)
2580683,135350,2012-12-22,5,I have to say that I have experimented several times to try and find the perfect baked macaroni and cheese and I made this receipe today and it was wonderful! I have made several receipes like this in the past but I paid close attention to the roux. It is the secret to the ultimate taste. The only thing I did differently was to add a 1/2 cup of shredded sharp provolone because I like more of a sharp taste. Just wonderful!
1910859,385472,2011-07-13,5,Perfect!!!
464327,221364,2008-02-24,5,"These are wonderful, not overly sweet muffins. I got 11 good sized muffins with perfectly crunchy tops and light tender bottoms. The sugar could probably be cut down even. This recipe was perfect, I'm happy that it didn't include any funny ingredients. These are all things that are in the house all the time. Thank you!"
440324,61095,2009-07-16,5,"Wow! This was delicious. I did not find the garlic flavor overpowering at all. I used whole wheat spaghetti for an even healthier treat. I just wish that garlic scapes were available all year round, because where I live you can only find them at the farmers market during the summer. Thank you for helping me utilize a new ingredient in such a flavorful way."
971396,233917,2008-09-29,5,Simple but very tasty. It's nice eating a pasta dish that feels healthy too. Will make again. Thanks!
2654514,385925,2018-09-22,5,"These were amazing. Made them to celebrate a birthday/hiking victory and will be shared around the campfire in a cabin in Alaska at the base of a mountain! They came out absolutely perfect and moist and delicious. Not too difficult , but making them last till tomorrow will be a challenge????"
2001390628,195237,2017-02-13,3,"Pretty good, honestly i'm not a cookie person, these are for my teen sons. So I was 1/2 done putting the recipe together and realized I didn't have &quot;Instant vanilla pudding&quot; so I used Dr Oetker vanilla mousse with a sprinkle of Shiriff cooked vanilla pudding. It worked out well but they came out pretty thin even though I put tons of dough per cookie. Regardless they're good, but I think I'd honestly prefer them with no pudding mix, but the kids are loving these so I'd say they're a win ??"
2428450,215026,2012-10-07,4,"This was my first attempt at making tempeh, and I am happy I chose this recipe. The sauce turned out like a bbq sauce, and the texture of the tempeh was a bit chewy, which I liked. I posted a picture of the tempeh for others to see."
67403,860,2007-04-07,5,Oh wow these really do taste like the ones at KFC! Good now I don't have to pay for good biscuits anymore!These came out picture perfect and I mean restaurant quality! They were moist and had SO much flavor! I really like the recipe amount to...its just enough for casseroles in place of refrig biscuits!
211329,386848,2012-03-09,4,"I had a similar recipe and over the years have lost contact with it so i searched and found this one and I must say, they were super delicious!  I love the dough and the sweetness it had and it goes so nicely with the beef and cabbage.  Glad to have found this recipe since mine went missing.  PS-these freeze well too,  Thanks Brookelynne26 for a definite keeper!"
32143,33489,2008-04-25,4,"I haven't had KFC's coleslaw, so I can't compare, but I thought it was very good. It had more of a citrus taste than I was looking for, but that didn't stop me from eating off it all week. I served with Recipe#10212 and BBQ chips."
792594,83678,2008-07-11,5,"Jim, I've made this twice now and people are anging the door down.  Didn't change a thing in the recipe, except for varying the balance between oven and grill cooking.  Usually I have to alter my own recipe depending on who's eating (spicy, not spicy, dry, wet), but everyone who tasted this loved it without exception!  Have not made the sauce yet...this weekend's project.

Thank you!"
437294,303399,2010-04-08,5,"This was excellent & easy! I didn't have any mozzarella so I used a pizza blend (has mozzarella  in it), which also worked nice. as I am dieting I doubled the veggies added artichoke heart & chopped broccoli."
187927,203229,2009-02-13,5,"This review is really just for the frosting and topping, which I used atop the easy version of these bars (I haven't tried these bars yet, but they look so good I *will* try them when I have a little time). The frosting was wonderful -- so easy and delicious! I used vanilla extract, and put the dried orange peel in the frosting instead of fresh zest on top of it (I wanted the flavor, but didn't want the orange color visible). Also, because I wanted the frosting pink without resorting to food coloring, I beat in additional cranberry juice... it produced a beautiful pale pink color and a bit more cranberry flavor. Simply grand, and sooo pretty! Thanks for a great addition to my dessert collection!"
226863,393140,2010-06-15,5,"Delicious!  I ended up making 5 burgers instead of 4.  I am a grill-a-holic, so just couldn't subject burgers to the broiler....sorry!  All I can tell you is that these are fabulous grilled!  I made exactly as posted, except on 1 burger I used gouda, on 2 I used provolone, and on 2 I used monterrey jack pepper cheese.  DS wouldn't eat the ones with pepper jack.  He ate his 3, and I had one....delicious.  So this serving for 4 served 2....although one person ate the bulk of it!!  Loved the avocado on this.  Thanks for sharing!"
499463,67740,2007-05-26,5,"This dip is very good.  Added a squeeze of lemon juice and dried, ground green chiles to taste.  substituted garlic chives and basil for the parsley and regular chives."
356130,3094,2006-12-21,5,"outstanding taste, texture, and prep. the best sugar cookie i've ever had. melts in the mouth. easy to decorate. thanks for sharing it. ( i added a dash of almond along with the vanilla like another lady did.)"
657845,90774,2008-08-15,5,"This cake definitely has a ""wow' factor.  It may look fancy but it's so easy to make and tastes great.  Some tips: assemble the cake just before serving.  The best thing to do is make the filling ahead of time and allow it to sit in the fridge for a couple of hours.  Also, you don't really taste the cream cheese so I would recommend adding a little more to your liking.  To make sure I have enough cake mix, I use the cake mix entender recipe.  I make this cake to impress-and it definitely does!!!"
1377630,317359,2009-09-18,5,Love the sauce!
5060,7747,2007-02-20,3,"Sorry this just didn't do it for us, the orange and lemon seem to overpower the fish. The timing was right on and it did look nice."
2001362808,50719,2017-01-22,0,My Husband was so busy watching Netflix he didn't know I was making these delicious Blueberry Muffins . He came into the kitchen while I was taking them out and was very surprise. Should have seen his face!!! :) He picked these blueberries himself so he's one happy man!
404214,198958,2006-12-10,5,"I do not know what went wrong.  They were horrible:  not much lemon flavor, the consistency was somewhat gooey even after cooking for more than the recommended time,half of the muffin stuck to the muffin cup liners.  This was a big waste of time and ingredients."
564289,444408,2011-04-25,5,This is an excellent soup! The dumplings are so good I could eat them alone. I will make this again and often. I added a can of black beans as Teddy's Mommy suggested and it gave it  added color and flavor.
201581,96877,2010-08-15,5,Thanks Paula for a great crust that doesn't require turning on the oven! I used this for Creamy Lemon Pie (Light) #96877 for a tasty treaat on a hot day! Made for Choose your Event party.
1250902,33489,2009-04-26,5,"LOVE THIS RECIPE! I will not eat any coleslaw besides KFC and this IS it!  I used Dole slaw mix and put it through a food processor to finely chop it.  Instead of buttermilk, I used my mom's secret of regular milk with 1 T. vinegar to curdle it.  I then used the regular 1 1/2 T. of vinegar as well. YUMMY!  I have 9 free bags of slaw mix, so I doubled the recipe and used 3 bags of slaw mix for a double recipe."
37449,318538,2009-07-01,5,"Yummy! I used ketchup instead of tomato paste(I usually open a can of paste and half of it goes bad, so I sub this alot for small portions, it works well). Great dressing! Thanks! Made for 123 Hit Wonders tag game."
280271,274468,2018-10-22,5,We loved this...I used the fancy whole baby clams by Bumble Bee...this gave us big chunks in every bite...I also cut this way back to serve 2...it does need salt...made for &quot;Autumn Fever&quot; tag game...
1171548,257436,2009-02-15,5,Oh soooo good! I doubled the recipe and had enough for friends at three different meetings (36 people in all) since it was so sweet that a small piece with ice cream was just perfect!The citrus gave it just enough of a kick! DEFINITELY do again! Excellent crust!
286566,326250,2012-01-22,5,"Doubled the recipe (though serving 3) and made in a loaf tin rather then as individual serves (baked for 50 minutes at 175C fan forced) using all very lean minced beef,  Though when making again I would only make enough sauce as per original recipe (2 serves) as I had nearly half left over but I think it will go well drizzled over salads and also as we don't didn't have dill I used parsley, which is growing rather well in the herb garden.  thank you Mom2Rose, made for Aussie Kiwi recipe swap #60 Januar4y 2012."
2000498330,134051,2018-10-06,4,An easy breakfast cake that was just slightly on the dry side. Didn't keep us from eating it. Think it could use a little oil in the batter. The topping is awesome.
609980,30425,2008-02-18,5,"Yummy! So rich, its a dessert where one slice is satisfying and plenty! We loved this, and it was so easy.
Thank you:)"
88378,19871,2013-09-20,5,"4.5 stars. Very delicious, maybe just a little chicken-heavy. I used bow tie pasta and needed an additional 10 minutes simmering time. Wonderful aromas, family enjoyed a lot!"
293410,62221,2008-03-07,5,"My mom and little brother said 5 stars right away; as for me, I just finished licking out my bowl! Served with vegan banana-vanilla ice cream for an easy, light Saturday night treat. Thanks!"
68904,137530,2009-06-03,4,"Very good recipe! It did not all fit in my tagine, however, and I had to transfer it to my largest skillet and finish it in my crockpot. It was a lot of food!"
131126,383392,2009-12-19,0,"This didn't match my expectations, but they do taste good.  They have a light coating of crispness & a mild lingering heat as you munch on them.   The problems I encountered started with the cooking time.  It took far longer in both stages. The stovetop portion was around 15 minutes to get it to a syrupy mix & in the oven the nuts were still swimming in liquid at 15 minutes.  I stirred & cooked them around another 30 minutes (checking & stirring often).  The glaze was very dark, almost to the point one would think they might be burnt.  After cooling they still had a very greasy feel so I poured them onto paper towel lined cookie sheets and then blotted them from the top too.  The spices don't jump out at all and I was looking for more flavor from the combination. All in all, they taste good, just not as spicy as I was after.  Thank you for sharing your recipe! Made for the Let's P-A-R-T-Y event."
333017,61610,2008-03-14,5,Wonderful!  You can add a bit of cayenne pepper to it to get it a zip!
400708,384086,2014-04-11,5,"I get so excited when I find a recipe that&#039;s been posted for awhile and hasn&#039;t been reviewed, it&#039;s like finding hidden treasure and this one is.  Other than the 15 minutes of constant stirring, this goes together so easy, with little fuss.  The directions couldn&#039;t be easier and easy to follow and the taste, Oh MY all that great tartness from the lemons - perfect.  After sitting in the fridge it firmed up perfect.  I&#039;m using this as a filling for a cake I have planned for Easter, but could see it working in a pie too.  Love this recipe.  Made for Spring PAC 2014"
968749,48606,2010-05-11,3,"I was disappointed with this.  I was expecting something delicious, the chicken to me tasted plain.  It was moist and tender, but just didn't have much flavor. I'll add seasoning to the panco if I try something like this again.  The sauce was not bad - not great, but not bad."
510096,496573,2013-03-08,5,I love the flavor combination on these and they are easy to make!
43083,379237,2010-07-08,3,I made this for my son (had a sip of it for reviewing authenticity) and it was a little sour for our taste. Would increase the sugar next time. Thanks for sharing though!
89831,202861,2008-07-15,5,"Annacia this is fantastic!  it is oh so good, this had gone into my favorites and I am going to make this again to serve at my BBQ get togethers... oh forgot to mention I increased the rum to 1/3 cup :) thanks for this great recipe!"
599450,142407,2012-03-25,4,"Unusual and delightful soup! Loved the combination of veggies, speaking of which, they took me a bit more than 8 minutes to chop, slice, and I like to remove the stems from the spinach. Thanks, breezermom. Made for Photo Tag."
523928,11734,2008-02-14,5,"Thanks again Bergy!
I did make a few changes: Dried red onion, and jarred minced garlic (small kids don't like onion, and this seems to disguise it for them) plus I used 1 tsp dry mustard, don't care for dijon so not in my house; and I always use quick oats instead of bread crumbs... pan fried them and the whole family ate it all up!  thanks again for a healthier alternative!"
1574992,106627,2011-08-20,5,"Wonderful recipe....I had never cooked butternut squash before! Trader Joe's sells the squash already peeled and cut up in the produce department, so I bought some and halved the recipe.  Also used salted butter and cut down on the amount of kosher salt.  I will make this again soon!"
88776,95222,2005-02-15,3,Maybe I did something wrong. I just wasn't crazy about this like the others who have posted. It seemed rather bland.
560491,458299,2013-03-16,5,"So quick and easy and had a great flavor!  Made with white cheddar since that is what was in the fridge, but left the rest of the ingredients as is.  I didn&#039;t mash the potatoes too much, left them kind of chunky.  Made for Zaar Stars."
262353,75733,2006-01-19,5,"I must say that this was a very tasty dinner ! And yes ya gotta have mashed taters!! Just make sure your room mates arn't asleep when you tenderizing your meat!!!
 lol 
we will have this again,thanx!!!"
149396,24799,2005-04-25,5,Perfect every time!!
972616,242694,2009-01-22,5,"These are so easy and fun to make! I was a little nervous about them cooking through, but they did with no problem! Fun kids dinner. Very quick! Thanks for the great idea! What a fun way to use my waffle iron!"
2001245808,21761,2016-11-14,5,OMG!!! I was looking for an easy recipe for brussel sprouts I never thought they would taste this AMAZING! 2nd day in a row I am serving them to my family. Even hubby is putting them on his plate. 10 STARS if it was possible
45351462,95416,2014-02-25,4,"First of all, I made a two-tiered Purple Ombre Chocolate Cake with Buttercream Frosting and a smash cake for my daughter&#039;s first birthday (i posted a picture of it in here). It was my first time to make a tiered cake and to use a ruffle design using buttercream. It took me weeks to find the best buttercream recipe.  I read a lot of reviews and so far, this recipe is &quot;IT&quot;!!!! Here&#039;s what I think about the icing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 stars - My ruffle design was holding up pretty well using this buttercream icing recipe. &lt;br/&gt;4 stars - At least it didn&#039;t have any hint of &quot;shortening&quot; taste unlike other recipes out there which was great. It would have been a &quot;5&quot; if it weren&#039;t too sweet for my taste. Instead of 5 cups of confectionar sugar, i&#039;ll probably make it 3-4 cups next time or simply dissolve salt in vanilla before mixing the dry ingredients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVERALL, this was a very good icing to make. This is definitely a keeper in my household! :) Thank you for sharing this recipe. :)"
884948,146361,2009-01-26,5,"Fantastic! I made this for a holiday party in the shape of a Christmas tree (I had a silicone pan) and used red and green M&M's as ornaments. It was a big hit. I wanted to take the leftovers home, but I it went so fast I didn't even get a chance to have a second piece. See my photo."
498271,267858,2008-09-12,5,Oh boy these burgers were GOOD!  I love ff onion rings and they gave such a great flavor to these.  I didn't add the salt and didn't miss it.  These burgers cooked up perfectly on the grill and were so flavorful - I will definitely  make them again - thanks for sharing!
795876,81845,2009-02-26,4,"Good, but next time I'll add 2 cans of tomatoes (I used rotel) and drain them instead of adding them undrained. Also strain the squash as much as you can to eliminate the moisture. Many people recommended adding more ingredients such as zucchini, mushrooms, bell peppers and onions. Great idea! I'll try that next time! We served ours with mashed up tortilla chips on top covered with salsa. Good and hearty!"
1423227,303107,2009-10-23,5,"I have been searching for a while for a good sandwich bread recipe, and yours is it!  It rose like it was supposed to and was the fluffiest I've ever made.  Thank you so much for posting it!"
358513,322492,2008-10-04,5,Delicious eggs I liked it with the mint. Gave it that middle eastern flair. Made for Ramadan Tag 2008. :)

Made this when my veggie son & DIL were here for an early & we all had a great breakfast, with them confiscating about half of the left-overs AND a copy of the recipe! Will certainly be making this one again! Thanks for sharing it! [Made & reviewed in Bargain Basement tag]"
561530,122968,2007-08-29,0,"I had to see this recipe because I make something similar.  I am not a fan of anything ""chunky"" in my food...like pimentos so I make mine with cream cheese, McCormick Hot Taco seasoning, and finely chopped jalepenos.  My MIL hates spicy food and loves these.  Even my 5 year old niece exclaimed ""these are good, how do make these?"" so cute lol.  

Nice recipe, will try for parties.
Thanks :)"
168423,49596,2004-12-25,5,Made this today for Christmas. Everyone enjoyed it. Taste like the peanut butter in Reeces Peanut Butter Cups. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
1929083,337680,2012-03-17,4,"I decided to take the plunge and be the first to go ahead and make this dessert.  My husband and I do low carb and high fiber foods mostly so this is right down our alley.  i like that this recipe incorporates some ingredients that I enjoy in my low carb desserts, the almond flour the cream cheese, and chocolate for example.  The recipe is very good, the cream cheese filling portion solidifies very nicely and the almond crust stays attached to the filling so when you slice you get a perfect square that does not fall apart and is pleasant to serve.  I would serve this with some whip cream as an elegant and satisfying low carb dessert.  I definitely will make this again as it calls for my basic pantry ingredients and is the perfect sweet bite."
1535,146953,2006-04-22,5,"Easy to make, a perfect last minute gift or treat for yourself. One person felt it was kind of weak and added more instant coffee so if you like a strong cup of coffee, increase that amount. Thanks!"
1825670,220702,2011-02-11,5,I'm 17 and a vegan and have only just started to cook within the last 6 months; every cake and batch of cookies I have made has either been a disaster or had problems... this was SO easy to make and I didn't stuff it up!! What's even better is that it is to die for... so delicious!! A really easy recipe with great results! :D Thanks you!!
385678,142464,2010-05-31,5,"This was delicious!  I used BRAGGS Liquid Aminos instead of the salt and reduced the amount of extra virgin olive oil, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  Thanks!!!  Looney Spoon Phoodies ZWT6. :P"
258799,24366,2012-10-21,5,This is perfect to my tongue - no additions necessary. I make it regularly to accompany turkey meatloaf.
424680,59998,2008-11-19,5,"Since I (with this recipe) was doing a variety of fruit flavors, I used strawberry yogurt, since that's what I had, then included everything else as indicated, & indeed, had a BERRY BERRY SMOOTHIE ~ Really loved this one, for sure, & will keep it around! [Tagged, made & reviewed in the Bargain Basement cooking game]"
437904,302998,2010-07-19,3,"We made this with fresh blueberries instead of strawberries...the flavor was delicious. Tart and fruity, very fresh; however, I thought the texture was too icy."
637254,53508,2007-11-04,5,Thank you Charlie and Sherri35!  Wonderful!
398964,198794,2008-04-17,4,"I made this using whole eggs instead of egg whites or egg substitue.  Also didn't have any fresh chives or dill around.  It was nice however, next time I'll be adding a little more spinach."
37449,493969,2013-09-22,5,I love putting lots of herbs in my salad and this used a nice amount! I enjoyed all the flavors. I halved the recipe and had enough for 2 servings. Thanks!
1097313,175211,2009-04-27,5,"Ok so I didn't exactly have the ingrediants this called for so I changed it up a bit substituting cajun seasoning and chilli powder for the fajita seasoning. I also used beef broth instead of water and added about a cup of wine. To get it to cook faster after 2 hours I took the meat out and sliced it then added it back to the sauce and let the sauce reduce with the lid off. It was done in about three hours and my roast was still mostly frozen when I started so all in all pretty quick. Amazing flavor, very tender, didn't have to heat up the whole house, deffinately a 5 star recipe!!!"
536463,113658,2009-03-22,5,"GREAT!!!!! I LOVE Bailey's but it is soooo high I very rarely get to buy it. Then when I do I have to have a cup here and a cup there to make it last. This recipe is one of my favorites, it taste enough like it to make me happy! PLUS I can afford to have more then one glass a month with this recipe. THANK YOU so much for posting!!!!!!"
333014,102274,2013-01-21,5,I made this recipe exactly as written the first time and it was good.  The second time I omitted the vinegar and the liquid smoke and I used smoked chili powder instead.  The second time ended up way better than the first.  Still a great recipe and you can play around with it to get the flavor you want.  I highly recommend smoked chili powder and no vinegar!!!
2001752608,12316,2018-01-03,0,This was listed under â30 Comforting Chicken Dinners.â This isnât a chicken dinner! LOL!!!
1597692,155754,2016-01-20,5,Thank you sooooo much for this delicious recipe. I will definitely make again..Perfect just as you posted :  )
744139,70165,2008-01-28,5,This crust was delicious! It baked perfeclty and wasn't too doughy and the bottom didn't burn. I chose to poke holes in it and pre-bake for ten minutes and it helped me spread the ingredients and turn out the perfect texture and consistency.
200862,195505,2006-11-15,3,"This sauce seemed exactly what I was looking for tonight: we're having white fish fillets, not ham, though. Molly, I preferred cutting the veggies by hand, which was a soothing task! The processor would have minced them too finely. However, the sauce needs tweaking. I added a seasoning salt and some Tabasco for a lift. It's pretty bland as it stands now. But I made some noodles, and I think the fish, noodles and sauce (and a side salad) will actually taste quite nice. (It's in the warming oven and will be eaten shortly). I'd suggest you consider adding salt, black pepper or pepper sauce to the recipe, and maybe chopped parsley. Thank you, it is something different and I loved the idea of all the veggies used in a sauce!"
586545,114067,2007-09-24,1,"Maybe I'm not use to the taste of curry, but this seemed like too much to me. The curry completely overwhelmed any other possible flavors in the wrap."
283390,87111,2010-04-26,5,"This may seem like a slightly odd combination of flavors (it seemed odd to me before I tried it), but it was really good!! The combination of coconut rice and avocado salsa was really tasty, and all of the textures together were so delicious. I used the optional lime, and I don't think I'd ever leave it out...it added something extra to the flavor. I am pretty sure I never would have thought of this combo on my own, so thank you so much for posting it! I'll be making it again soon."
266392,245590,2010-10-03,5,This was amazing! I was looking for a rub that would mimic the coffee cured fillet at Stoney River and I think this is it! I used instant coffee (no grinder) and 1/2 chilli powder 1/2 paprika. I also went easy on the salt. The amount was enough to cover 4 fillets with a little leftover. I pressed the top and bottom as well as the sides into the mixture and let it sit for about 2 hours. Grilled to medium rare and topped with bleu cheese butter. Heaven!
1135672,403895,2009-12-24,5,"Wonderful!!!  Just finished making these as a last-minute addition to our Christmas table, and I think these will be a permanent addition to my ""must-bake"" list of Christmas goodies.  I made these exactly as stated, using 200g (7oz?) of chopped white chocolate and a 170g (6oz) bag of sweetened dried cranberries.  These are such delightfully flavoured cookies - I made some as drop style cookies and the rest as a more traditional style round.  YUM!  Thank you so much for posting!"
2001552685,441783,2017-05-24,5,"Our family's favorite pot roast recipe! So moist, tender and flavorful. Easy prep important for us as working parents with 2 growing boys."
445711,66258,2007-08-20,5,"A little messy to eat (be prepared for greasy fingers), but vey tasty!"
579911,26213,2010-01-24,5,"Wow, this was absolutely delicious.  I will have to say that I am not a big dessert person...at all.  I simply don't like sweets...but this was fantastically rich and creamy and my family LOVED it.  The crust was crunchy and delicious and the filling was creamy and divine.  I was a little concerned because the crust crumbled when I started to layer the topping, but after setting in the frig for 24 hours, it all came together nicely.  Thank you, Sharon, for posting and I am sure my family will demand I make this again."
56003,310936,2009-10-13,4,"This was surprisingly good!  I think I will use a little more cayenne next time.  Came out moist, but not soggy.  Quick and easy, just like I like them!  Thnx for sharing your recipe, yumyumum.  Made for PAC Fall 2009."
165755,33919,2013-12-28,5,"Wow!  This was so much more than I thought it would be.  Flavor was amazing, easy to put together, easy to cleanup while cooking so most of the &quot;after&quot; mess was cleaned before we sat down.  I split this into two smaller casserole type dishes, used one tortilla cut up in small pieces as a lower layer, even though I had pieces of dry tortilla on top of dry tortilla, the time in the oven merged everything together nicely!  I used the mushroom soup as per the recipe, cut back the taqco seasoning (Old El Paso) a tad so it wasn&#039;t overpowering and cooked as per directed.  I received rave reviews all the way around the table.  There were 7 of us eating and from the youngest (6) to the oldest everyone loved it!  I paired this spanish rice and tortilla chips on the side, lettuce, tomato on top.  Thank you, thank you for posting this.  We enjoyed and will make this on a regular basis. :D"
486725,407694,2014-10-16,5,"First time we ate this at dinner, I would have given it 4 fours, but when I ate the leftovers I used tartar sauce instead of ranch (as another reviewer did), and it brought my rating up to 5 stars. I used Trader Joe&#039;s jalapeno tartar sauce, so it gave it a nice kick, and it was really the bomb with it. The base recipe is really easy and contains great ingredients. Any way you make it, you will enjoy it."
358796,118191,2009-02-20,5,"If you don't want to cut into rounds (it can be crumbly), just spread/press goat cheese into the bottom of a small dish and then pour the goodness over it. Use a small cheese spreader for spreading onto bread. We left to marinade for 5 hours. Salty, tangy, creamy & crunchy - what more could you ask for?"
499032,113817,2009-03-27,5,"I thought I hated asparagus, but the trick of snapping the ends off worked! I never had asparagus before, but dh loves it, so I have tried to cook it before, but failed miserably. I didn't know how to prepare it! I will be buying more in the future. Oh, did not change ingredients, but cooked at 350 for 30 mins due to my finicky oven. Salmon was perfect!"
2001703570,2886,2017-09-06,5,"Best banana bread ever! I use 4 bananas for the extra moistness! Easy, quick, and soooo delicious."
1911882,146753,2013-05-02,5,These are The Bomb!! OMG!! I did use 1/2 cup of oil instead of 1/3 cup omg so chewy and delicious!! for me I though they tased better the following Day that I made them im a huge red velvet fan so I will be most defiantly making these again! it doesn&#039;t get much easier then this recipe
67103,22526,2006-09-16,3,"I have three boys and none of them liked the rolls.  My husband and I thought they tasted pretty good, but not great.  They smelled great while baking and were beautiful when I inverted them on the plate, so I am a little disappointed.  Around the edges were especially dry with not much of the sauce on them and tasted like just plain dinner rolls.  I will probably not make this recipe again, but it was definitely worth the try.  Thanks, Bert.  I'm sorry I couldn't give it a better rating.  It just didn't work well for our family."
2000995652,387840,2016-05-01,0,I did not care for them. Think it was the flax meal
214988,73522,2008-01-02,5,WOW!! These were the hit of my cookie exchange party!!  I baked them in a 11x17 pan and used white chocolate chips and Craisins for the dried cranberries.  I cute them in to 1 inch squares and they were so sweet and moist.  These are now part of my holiday baking traditions!  Thank You Kittencal!
579814,44487,2007-12-27,5,"I am gluten-free and thought I would just have to ""get over"" pizza until my daughter got me to try this pizza. 

Hint: Don't use too much rice flour when pressing into pan or you may lose some of the chewiness in the dough. 

Five stars... delicious... This recipe may have saved my sanity  :)"
785604,317278,2009-08-25,5,"My friends were raving about this at a party I took it to :) I used 16 oz whole wheat shells, I used extra cheese - grated swiss and sharp cheddar.  I also added 1 tsp dry mustard and 1 onion that I grated.  I think you have to stir it at least once or twice, just my opinion.  Thanks for posting this!"
25812,149893,2009-10-18,5,"Easy and tasty for either weeknight or company dinner.  I too have tried this recipe with orange marmelade and freshly shredded ginger and the results were excellent.  If you are in a pinch, this can be placed in a crockpot under low settings for several hours."
80079,58341,2005-01-12,5,"delicious!  very nice appetizer for an Italian dinner....or as a light dinner, have a few with salad.  I followed Denise's suggestion and put some prosciutto on there.  I took the easy way out, and used sliced mozzerella from the deli instead of slicing it myself, and then I still placed it between plastic wrap and rolled it with a rolling pin to ""meld"" the edges together. "
87877,26205,2003-11-20,5,"Great Crust !!!  It's amazing what a little lemon juice can do!  I've been trying a lot of different, but always ""almost"" the same recipes, trying to find the perfect pie dough, and I think this is it.  Thanks, Mean Chef.  The only thing I did differently was to do it by hand, since I was feeling too lazy to clean up the processor afterward.  I ran the cold butter and shortening through a coarse grater into the flour, rather than chopping it up, and then incorporated everything using a pastry blender.  I've used this recpe now for a chicken pot pie and and apple pie, and it was great for both."
675214,246602,2007-12-28,5,Just lovely! What a great little treat. And there wasn't a single one left! Totally addicting...
1802568966,238069,2014-07-02,5,"Mom knew how to make a roast! I went 17 minutes after using a few garlic slices, the onion and the garlic powder following an hour to get it to room temp.Then the hour in the oven and 15 minutes outside oven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tastes great!"
189643,106826,2005-09-23,5,"Delicious, healthy breakfast, though not as pretty as yours I'm sure! I managed to break off two edges attempting to flip it! The plate thing is a nice trick though. I'll work on that. I added more cheese, and used cheddar, since the kids are on an ""orange cheese only"" kick! I will surely make this again. Thanks Paula!"
2837900,507063,2013-10-13,5,"I make this all the time and I&#039;m surprised there are no reviews. I always spread the cream cheese on the bottom of a glass dish, drain and rise the black beans, mix in the raspberry chipotle salsa, pour on top of the cream cheese and then add the shredded cheese on top and then bake. It&#039;s all going in the same place, I know but it just looks a little prettier when layered."
2001467977,383779,2017-04-02,5,"The Orange Crunch Cake At the Bubble room was absolutely the best cake I have ever had in my 40 years on this earth. Went there to try the Red Velvet cake that is rumored to be a favorite of Author Stephen King. Loved the Red Velvet cake, but the Orange Crunch Cake takes the GOLD! The frosting was a light orange, not off white like in the photo! Will try this recipie, but recommend the Bubble room hands down!"
2000840399,202461,2016-01-26,0,It tastes like Boston market chicken if you add 1 tablespoon of seasoned salt to the marinade and put it in the food processor. Boston market chicken doesn&#039;t have chunks of garlic in it. I also use dark meat chicken quarters. The seasoned salt and the food processor make all the difference in this recipe.
653438,117029,2010-04-04,5,Made this last night to finish up my sugar snap peas and I am so glad I did! Delicious!! I put the peas in a micro safe dish and covered cooking for a few minutes than added to the other ingredients as PaulaG had done. Simple and wonderful. I served this with Recipe#115446#115446 and Recipe#344598#344598 and we had a great meal. Thank you.
502463,13269,2009-08-17,4,I made this last night. I did use Diet Coke and a boneless pork loin roast because that's what I had on hand. My husband loved it!
281871,38015,2007-01-05,5,good healthy juice. i skipped the ginger.
2002224954,168678,2018-07-21,0,"I have not tried to make it yet, but what I did tried was the strawberry cheesecake in the cup."
48286,195086,2010-12-18,5,"Used this for my first attempt at making marmalade, and it turned out terrific! It thickened up perfectly, and had just the right amount of sweetness. Love this recipe!"
122993,49707,2007-05-19,5,"VERY rich! Yes indeed! My teeth are still spinning from the one that I sampled. :) I halved the recipe and used almond bark for the coating, no wax. PAC Spring '07"
47892,130408,2005-10-19,5,We love potatoes and these are wonderful. What a great way to highlight those lovely Walla Wallas from Washington state. Thanks for sharing your aunt's recipe with us. cg
341170,349613,2009-11-06,4,Pretty good for a quick and simple meal! I used cream of celery cause DH doesn't like mushrooms. I also don't have Worcestershire sauce so I used a bit of Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce. I cut the baking time to 2 mins and even then the edged started to dry. I think next time I'll add some dill
737805,244245,2008-02-03,5,"These are AWESOME!! Made for my family(me being the only vegan), the comment was ""These are the BEST you've ever made.""  The last time I made brownies (which I didn't eat) were the ones you buy in a store in a box. Thanks so much for this VEGAN brownie... mmm yummmy.."
498271,248641,2007-10-08,5,"Oh boy this was YUMMMMMY!  Incredibly easy to make with a rich and elegant taste.  I did add the extra powdered sugar as suggested to thicken the sauce a little.  I served this on a spicy apple cake, but I have to admit I ate a few spoonfuls by itself as well!!  Absolutely delicious!"
188390,83561,2005-02-21,5,"The flavors were so good. Easy to make and ingredients you would have on hand. This is a great way to make chicken, and this will be made again in my house!"
651144,8400,2008-03-31,5,actually I loved it I had to make two substitions: I just used FINE whole wheat flour for flour and used a sugar substitute for the sugar as I am unable to eat sugar and white flour and the recipe came out great. This is the first time I have been able to make a whole wheat cake that looks and tastes like cake instead of a wheat biscuit.
953790,181229,2009-05-04,5,"Awesome.  Do it just like she says with one exception, DOUBLE the recipe or you will surely be wanting for more."
565109,240198,2008-10-16,5,This is absolutely the BEST mac and cheese you would ever wish to make!  I found it years ago in the Los Angeles Times and whenever anyone mentions macaroni and cheese this recipe comes to mind. I always double the recipe for a crowd.
47559,95352,2009-05-03,5,This review is for the cake part of the cupcakes.  They were dark and had good chocolate taste.  They were also nice and moist.  I'll make them again.
274057,198689,2008-04-26,5,"Just made these and WOW they are really yummy.  I love all the textures.  I used a little less sugar (a heaping 3/4 cup) and quick oats (since it didn't specify).  I chopped the walnuts pretty fine, so the kids wouldn't complain.  I baked 18 minutes using pure convection.  I divided into 16 muffin cups.  They turned out moist inside and with a nice crust.  Next time I might reduce the temp a few degrees.  Definately a keeper!  Thanks!!!"
68460,95675,2004-07-25,5,"I'd never made salsa from canned tomatoes before and I have to admit that I'm really pleasantly surprised.  This salsa is so quick and easy to throw together and it tastes great!  I made it as written using 2 large green onions and real garlic (as opposed to the powder).  We had this with chips and everyone was happy.  Also, it's not real spicy, which pleased a couple of members of my family.  If you like your salsa really spicy, I'd advise adding some Tabasco.  Thanks for the recipe Barb, I'll be doing this one again for sure."
1231036,38124,2009-07-19,5,"This was EXACTLY how I remembered key lime pie to taste! I grew up in Massachusetts and Florida and was spoiled to have endless amounts of key lime pie throughout my childhood. Now living in CA the only chances I get at key lime pie are the frozen varieties, which are just no good. 

Since I am out in CA finding key limes or key lime juice was a bit tricky so I substituted key lime juice for 1/2 lime juice 1/2 lemon juice (freshly squeezed) and I just zested two limes in replace of the key lime zest. Honestly the pie tastes amazing, just as I remembered it. So refreshing on a hot summer evening!! 

Thank you SOO much for this easy and delicious recipe, I will be making this often!"
385999,32416,2007-03-12,5,"I made these and everyone who has eaten them love them.  How nice to see a Vegan Biscotti recipe.  I used sunflower oil instead of veggie oil, and they turned out delicious.  Great recipe."
57338,93914,2005-01-31,4,We had this for dinner last night.  It was really good & crispy! The only addition I made was some garlic powder. 
454307,245398,2007-08-17,5,it was good
291188,415248,2010-06-01,5,"Thank you, for some reason my mind read lime even though it says lemon so I used Lime and it is wonderful! I am sure lemon is just as good. I wanted to start drinking or eating honey every day. I am not a big tea drinker, I don't mind it but not everyday, plus I don't want to darken my teeth. I heard if you eat honey local to your area everyday you can become immune to certain pollens which will help reduce allergies! I wanted to try this approach to prevent taking medicine the rest of my life. I hope it works! Thanks!"
231054,63786,2007-04-02,5,"I thought I had already submitted a review of this recipe -- but apparently not.  These are so good!  I have only made them with the chicken (but I'm sure the steak or even pork would be just as tasty).  I have a large jar of Penzeys Fajita Seasoning on hand, so I added about a tablespoon of it to the other ingredients.  I also love the lime juice, so added an extra tablespoon of it as well.  Just prior to removing the mixture from the skillet, I sliced a couple tomatoes into thin wedges and added them to the mixture.  These are not only delicious, but pretty quick to make (but allow for the extra time if you should want to marinate the meat).  In order to cut calories, I had the leftovers over some lettuce (sort of made a Fajita Salad).  Rhonda, thank you for posting this recipe."
166642,454888,2011-05-29,5,This is an outstanding burger! All of the ingredients used together made for one VERY tasty sandwich. The sauce is wonderful. Excellent entry!
375404,30812,2006-11-20,5,This was super easy to make and tasted awesome.  We ate it with fritos.  Nice alternative to chili.
113941,178556,2009-06-09,5,"This sandwich was FANTASTIC, Sharon!!! LOVED it!!! I was out of pickles, though, so i just used some pickle relish and it came out great! (Putting pickles on the next shopping list! ;) ) Thanks so much!!! :) Made for the ZWT5!! :)"
424680,357863,2009-03-12,5,"ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! We really liked this cake, especially with the great cream topping ~ The combo of poppy seeds & lemon (I like the lemon taste, so almost doubled the amount of zest!)! Thanks for a great cake recipe keeper! [Tagged, made & reviewed in Please Review My Recipe]"
45999,84805,2004-11-27,4,These cookies are very good however a wee bit rich.  I think I would like to try them next time without the chocolate chips.
526269,20616,2009-03-18,5,"My daughter is allergic to dairy so I made this with tofutti better than sour cream. It came out wonderful and I was able to share St Patricks day with her.  
Thanks for posting."
1048246,239821,2009-06-03,5,"This sauce is so good on hot dogs, and we really enjoyed them with Recipe #251957.  The rolls were so tender and delicious, and the sauce over the hot dogs were the ultimate!  Even my littlest one liked them.  Thanks!"
413121,315697,2009-01-20,4,"This is a really great bean with bacon soup.  I wanted traditional, so I left the red bell pepper out, but I might try it next time.
Thanks so much for posting!"
223979,173567,2006-07-26,5,"This is excellent!!  I actually had 
Amarula; but never had it with creme de cocoa and Amaretto.  I love it!  Great drink!  Thanks!"
2706705,497440,2013-03-23,5,This looked so good I had to try it. I love pasta and this was a unique way to make pasta and use potatoes. I sometimes have left over potatoes or mashed potatoes from dinner so I think it would be easy to substitute. Great dish Chef JaylinHawkins
42236512,114558,2015-02-08,0,Loved it but I used beef and beef broth and it was wonderful!!!!
2001891281,105281,2017-12-26,5,Side dish to accompany prime rib and loaded mashed potatoes. Delicious
143946,17566,2007-03-19,2,I tried two of the top rated Pasta E Fagioli recipes on recipezaar and found them both to be OK. I guess when I think of Italian I crave cheesy or meaty or spicy... this was more like chunky v-8 juice. I like V-8 juice but for a meal I'd rather eat spaghetti and meatballs or Zuppa Toscana. I hope this review is helpful to others who like to try new things.
29300,50353,2004-02-28,5,"This was so good! I did one thing different though, I added bits of bacon. This is such a fresh and light recipe. We loved it and will be making it from now on. With or without the bacon it is absolutely........WONDERFUL!! Thank you very much for the wonderful recipe! Oh....I served it with grilled chicken and fresh homeade bread with real butter..."
416605,40888,2007-03-26,3,"This soup was okay, an interesting variation on the vegan puree soups that have become a staple for me. It was the first time I've ever cooked celery, and I enjoyed the flavor there, but I think the sweet was a little overpowering.  I also think it could benefit from some herbs.  Still, very simple and healthy."
101823,43327,2005-07-04,5,"I have a similar recipe posted that uses a fresh strawberry and homemade glaze as a topping.  This is a very easy alternative.  Today, I chose to use cherry pie filling, as my Hubby likes that best.  Thanks for posting."
1803690785,147497,2015-01-22,5,Phenomenal and do easy to make!
197023,342231,2009-01-17,5,"Very tasty and certainly a great way to use up leftovers although, on this occasion, I cooked up some turkey breasts using MsSally's Recipe #206176 for use in this and another turkey recipe, both of which I was planning to make in large quantities for the freezer.  I doubled this recipe, but it was still quite quick to prepare. Except for using many more mushrooms (probably about three cups: I didn't measure them), I made this exactly to the recipe.  We thoroughly enjoyed the serving we ate and are delighted that we have a healthy stockpile of future meals in the freezer.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, Jess.  All the ingredients went so well together. Delicious! It will certainly be one of my regular recipes when preparing meals ahead.  Made for PRMR."
58605,70331,2003-09-04,5,"This is a quick and easy recipe.  It's also the first time I have made bread pudding in the microwave.  It is very tasty.  Thanks so much, and welcome to the Zaar!!!"
12619,87085,2004-11-09,5,"Pretty good. I will be making this one again. I did not not have green pepper on hand, so I left it out. Also I didn;t have any fresh garlic cloves, so I used 2tsp. garlic powder insted. Thanks Kim D"
43986,87813,2004-04-27,5,These were absolutely delicious.  Family just loved them.  
134962,41941,2004-03-27,4,Delicious muffins!!  The struesel adds a great flavour and nice appearance.  Wonderful use for frozen rhubarb.
2000025137,53768,2017-04-29,5,I'm trying to lose this recipe. It's sooo dangerously delicious I could eat it all myself! People will go nuts. No tweaking necessary.
179133,190969,2011-10-23,4,"This was very tasty! I used homemade barbecue sauce (recipe #249779). The only thing I really changed was to cook the onions and peppers with the beef (and I used yellow & orange peppers as I had some already chopped in the freezer). As there was a lot of meat I decided to use a 13x9 pan (since you didn't specify) and when I started to add the cornbread I was afraid this might end up a disaster because there wasn't enough batter to cover the meat, so it was kind-of cornbread ""dumplings"". Fortunately after baking it puffed up some and covered most of it. This would be good with less meat and some beans added but it was good as is too! Oh, also, for anyone that is wondering, the muffin mix calls for 1 egg and 1/3 cup milk (I used buttermilk as I had it on hand). Thanks for sharing!"
444622,218323,2007-06-23,4,We used regular flour tortillas instead of whole wheat and granny smith apples. Enjoyed these for a quick weekend snack with sharp cheddar cheese sprinkled on the apples. Very tasty and versatile recipe!
88378,241322,2010-03-10,3,"Shockingly good, indeed!  But I was also unhappy with this recipe.  I made this for a dinner party with my in-laws, 7 people total around the table.  I was meticulous in following the recipe.  I weighed the boneless chicken breasts on an accurate kitchen scale, for a total of 2 pounds, and therein lay a dilemma.  The recipe states that it ""serves 10."" I was counting on that yield, but I also knew upon looking at 2 lbs. of chicken breast on the scale that there was no way it would serve 10 people.  Furthermore, it states that I should have had 30 skewers of chicken.  Honestly, how is that possible?  Step 1 (slicing the chicken) was maddeningly vague - across the grain?   I ended up deciding to use nearly 3 lbs. of boneless chicken breasts, and I cut them into neat 1/2"" width strips; I came up with  21 skewers MAX.  There was enough at the table, but just barely.  No way would this amount serve 10 people!  I was careful to only take 1 skewer myself so that the rest of the table would have enough, so I got just a tad.  That was way disappointing!  No hostess needs to worry about the amount of food at her table, especially when the recipe has said it would serve 10 people.  As far as the dipping sauce goes, I took the advice of most reviewers and cut the lime juice to 2 T.  It was very delicious made thus, but there was too much... the chicken long gone.  I saved the sauce to use on rice or something (?) later in the week.  Overall, an impressive dinner party dish but misleading and vague in instructions!"
220195,417122,2014-02-21,5,"The pairing of bland tofu with garlicky green chimichurri sauce is brilliant. The salad is okay, but nothing special, almost any veggie salad would work well with this. I highly recommend making this recipe if you have a vegetarian or vegan at a barbecue and have no idea what to do!. Make plenty of chimichurri, as the carnivores will want some too. It&#039;s as little fiddly to hand chop the ingredients, and it is easily done in a food processor, but be sure you don&#039;t make a puree, it needs to have a good texture. Grating the garlic on a microplane grater is also helpful, but the smaller the pieces are, the stronger the flavor, so adjust the amount if you go in that direction. I found that the recipe didn&#039;t need quite the amount of salt called for; I recommend starting with half, then tasting as you go until it suits you. I fried the tofu in a little grapeseed oil in a cast iron skillet to get a crispy surface on it and chose to omit the bread and serve it on a bed of jasmine rice.I suspect even people who think they hate tofu would enjoy this if hey tried it!"
27424,48219,2003-03-27,5,"I loved this recipe too; because my Mom's diabetic, and loves ginger, and so I substituted Sugar Twin for the sugar, and used Corn syrup, as I didn't have Molasses on hand.
This recipe in my opinion was on the best I've found; because although it still calls for two kinds of sweeteners, it was less sweet than others I had looked at. As previously stated by the other two who reviewed it, I agree it was easy to make; and I added to My Cookbook, as I would definitely make it again. Thank you for sharing your Grandma's recipe, she must have been a wonderful lady, these kind of memeories are priceless."
150281,221532,2008-05-28,5,"This was wonderful! I am reviewing it for ZWT5 and we loved this recipe. Very easy and quick to make, it was a delightful dinner! I did add some mushrooms to the recipe, but everything else was pretty much as listed.
Thank you for a great recipe!"
219311,123588,2005-05-30,5,"Wow!!!!  I was looking for a nice quick lunch for a bunch of teenagers yesterday at the pool.  This was fantastic and I should have made more.  I thought 4 pizzas would do it.LOL
Luckily I hide a slice for my lunch today!  Thank you for such a special treat."
33133,9538,2002-03-20,5,Very tasty...used cream of chicken soup instead and added a Tbsp. of capers...very easy recipe to work with.
229310,23480,2006-03-15,5,"Made this cake frequently when I was just a newbie cook when I lived in Germany as a military wife. When the boys were gone on manuevers the girls would gather for movies,wine and goodies and it was always my job to bring the cake (this and Black forest were always the most requested) Strawberry and Raspberry have always been the favorite flavors of Jello.
Thank you for posting this as I had not made this in nearly 20yrs and forgot the amount of water when preparing the jello.
Will have to make this again!!!"
209318,179633,2008-03-11,4,"Well, I needed something that used up my asparagus and an avocado that's not going to make it much longer. I threw in a bit of spinach in for fun. I gave it a 4 because I thought it was a bit bland. HOWEVER, if I'd made just the way it's stated I think it would've been more flavorful. I used olive oil instead of butter and I didn't use 4 T - as that is A LOT! I also didn't use as much cheese. So, if you do that I would recommend adding basil (I killed my plant, so that didn't happen) or another strong flavored herb or spice to add a bit of zing. All that said, it was very good - bright and colorful - wonderful use of all the veg I had in my fridge. Thanks!"
149363,66237,2004-09-10,5,"I made this casserole for my family when I had to go out one night, and I told them to save me some....there was none left when I got home!

Thanks for posting!"
213114,116738,2006-10-08,4,Very tasty! Reminiscent of Stewed Tomatoes that my mother made on the stovetop. I really like this baked version. I served it as a side for a steak dinner but I could make a meal out of it!
135525,80393,2012-08-21,5,Very easy and good.This is a keeper.Thanks for adding

30716,38971,2002-09-10,4,"This was very good. I made the tomato option and will try the mushroom next time. The sauce was a bit sweet for me, I will reduce the sugar next time if I made the tomato sauce type again. Very enjoyable and simple recipe."
41578,86873,2004-03-22,5,"This is to-die-for!!!!  While vacationing out west, we had quite a few pot luck dinners and I prepare this for the gang.  THE CROWD WENT WILD!   I loved the fact that it can be made ahead of time and just pulled from the freezer and serve.  Thanks, Kittencal, for sharing this.  It's a GREAT find.
"
341170,391318,2009-11-27,4,"I skipped the streusel as I've never been a big fan of it and instead topped them with a cinnamon/sugar mix. I made regular and mini muffins, the minis took 15 minutes and the regular took 20 minutes. Don't really taste enough banana in it for my liking, but still something different! They were nice and light and fluffy and much enjoyed by all"
675543,4765,2008-09-02,5,"I loved them! I like the fact that they are fat like steak fries yet not fried. I will not eat sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving with all the marshmellows, but this I can do. My bf wasn't crazy about them, but he ate 'em. I used EV-olive oil, seasoned salt, and paprika. I even ate the left-overs the next day. I'll pick this healthy option over Mickey D's any day."
459574,263707,2009-06-05,5,"These are fabulous sugar cookies! I halved the almond and added a tsp of vanilla. They are so easy and look professional. Rolling them into balls is much faster than having to use a rolling pin and cookie cutter, as many other sugar cookie recipes require. These spread perfectly. I frost mine with buttercream icing. They stay soft and have a lot of flavor!"
1086570,178003,2013-03-06,5,"This was a easy dish to make and it was easily 5 stars. We doubled the cooking time because the meat was pretty thick. the sauce was delightful, however I will make it a little thicker next time. I consider this recipe a real find and thanks to the chef for the recipe. BRAVO"

266635,271941,2014-04-24,5,"Made this rotisserie chicken tonight for dinner.  Loved the flavor of the orange-soy sauce -- the chicken came out nice and tender too.  Made this chicken in my Showtime Rotisserie -- came out perfectly.  Made for Spring PAC, April 2014."
198039,98150,2005-03-03,5," All my Hungarian and Polish family members made cabbage rolls, so I ate alot of these in my life. I made them last weekend and they were a lot of work, but WOW I never had them as good. This recipe is tops. I cut the recipe in half and shouldn't they were gone in two days and I wanted freeze some."
230860,157196,2009-01-21,2,"Not really sure what it was, but this just wasn't for us.  It sounded good, but it ended up having an oddly sweet taste that just didn't do it for us."
91453,58439,2004-11-07,4,"great recipe - very flavorful. I omitted water chestnuts as I don't care for them in savory dishes. Instead I added sliced onions (1/2 of a medium one). I sauteed the onions first before adding the beef and pepper. Instead of water, I added dashi stock instead. Very yummy and simple recipe. Thanks for posting. (Pick Your Chef Nov04)"
137302,405943,2010-05-26,5,"I made these potatoes a couple of days ago and they were very good.  I was thinking that this would be a good dish for leftover cooked or baked potatoes, since it would change the taste and consistency considerably.  I almost had too much sauce left over so next time I will probably cut back a bit on the sour cream and pouring cream.  I didn't know for certain what Australians call pouring cream...so I used whipping cream rather than half and half.  My potatoes did not brown too quickly in the slow oven as others stated.  Thanks katew!"
131674,88797,2004-06-26,5,My boys love this.  I make it for them all the time.  They can't get enough.  Very simple to do.
280271,190784,2007-03-30,4,"We loved this dish! I too made in WW friendly following the helpful tips from toni gifford. I cut it in half (just two of us) it worked great.I skipped the food processer (lazy, I didn't want to get it out or clean it) So I mixed all the tomato mixture together, using red wine and I doubled the red pepper flakes, we like hot and spicy. Turned out great! I will be making this again. Next time I think I will add in some green or red bell peppers. Thanks, Redsie for posting."
226863,462563,2012-12-14,5,"This was a hit at our house!  My son really enjoyed it, and ate 6 thighs!  The flavor of the sauce is very good...really permeated the meat.  I will definitely make this again...easy to make after a day at work.  Thanks so much for sharing!"
133174,174504,2006-09-12,5,This gets a 5 star for the cooking method alone.  The rice was cooked to perfection after cooking the time specified and allowing it to stand covered for an additional 5 minutes.  I did use brown basmati rice which generally results in a little longer cooking time.  The amount of butter was reduced to 1 tablespoon and in place of the beef consomme used beef base with the appropriate amount of water.  Thanks for sharing.
135863,60028,2005-05-30,5,"I made your recipe for Mother's Day, Keen 5, and it was just delicious!  I used unsalted, dry-roasted almonds instead of pecans, and butter instead of shortening.  Next time I make these I will add a dash of almond extract.  I found that applying the half-and-half and sprinkle of sugar to the round of dough before cutting it into wedges made the process easier.  I also found that a bench scraper worked really well for cutting the dough.  Thank you for this classic of a recipe!"
302094,113591,2007-08-17,5,I just finished the last batch of these little jems. They are absolutly the best oatmeal cookies. I did add the choc. chips and the walnuts and wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for an awesome cookie Creole Queen!
567537,151551,2010-11-16,5,"My mom introduced me to this soup.  We love it!  I go easy on the Chipotle because my 3yo doesn't like spicy, so I just add a few sprinkles and add some paprika and thyme.  Also, I add some chopped frozen spinach to it (about 8oz) and about a 1/4 - 1/2 bulgur.  Makes the soup a bit more filling.  Great find!"

107583,462165,2011-11-05,5,"Great bread, and simple to make, which I needed today, since we have colds here.  I usually let the machine do the hard work and then bake it off in the oven, but decided to let the machine do it all.  Made a perfect size loaf and went great with the chicken soup.  Will be making this at Thanksgiving time also, since it would be perfect for a turkey sandwich!"
1941733,145279,2011-07-01,4,"This recipe was really good. Followed it almost completely, but I left out the ham and spam. ( I don't like either and wasn't sure what to substitute.) Tasted pretty much how I expected. I would have liked it to have a little more POW! Next time I'll just add more of the spices."
780172,290192,2008-05-10,5,"This was great! It was easy to make and very healthy with a great taste. I did add a little more yogurt to make it a little smoothier and I did add the honey as we used very tart frozen raspberries. Also, doubled the oaks. Will make again."
194829,43538,2008-10-08,5,"I'm in the process of making this and doing taste-tests! This is great stuff. I put it all in the crockpot to simmer, and the house smells cozy and warm and spicy. It's a cool Fall day and perfect for good chili!

Used a mix of red and green bell pepper, doubled the garlic, but cut the cayenne in half, since I wasn't sure how spicy the sausage would be. Turned out great, not too garlicky, not too spicy. Used b/l s/l chicken breasts boiled earlier in the day and large shrimp I had in the freezer. DH took leftovers to work and said he had to watch the crockpot to keep his co-workers from stealing his lunch. :-)"

399474,259979,2008-01-30,5,"I loved this! I don't usually use ginger but this combination was really great! I didn't have parmesan but I'm sure it would be good. I did not follow the same cooking directions. I just put my broccoli in a microwave dish by itself, covered with plastic and microwaved for about 3-4 min until it was cooked then I added the butter and mixed it up, then added the spices mixed it up, and topped with the reserved spices. I might even try baking it sometime for a little bit more crunch. It turned out great and will be making it again for sure! Thanks so much for a new way to make broccoli, love it!"

It was late when fixing, so I just used the toaster oven for the crostini; I will try this with the crostini, as directed, soon! I added approx. 1/2 tsp. of herbes de provence, as my 'herb' addition.

When it came right out of the oven and was still warm, it was good, but kind of chewy and not like regular banana bread. The next day, when it had cooled down, it was just plain chewy. Sorry, this one just didn't work out for me, but I'm sure that others with different tastes will like it. Thanks for posting. :)"

Also, I was lacking in mint extract so I powdered up a few mini candy canes and used a table spoon of that instead. WILL make again. Thanks!"
2415068,5478,2012-09-22,4,"I made this tonight, and went by the recipe except the temperature--did 450 because of my oven-and I added a dash of cayenne since others mentioned it being bland.  My chicken wasn't dry or bland--it came out great. I did use an 9x9 baking dish rather than a 9x13, and I went with lining the pan with foil.  My husband did say the garlic could be reduced a little, and he thought adding soy next time sounded good. I thought it was great the way it was and my 6 year old said it was ""Awesome! 4 stars!"". We will for sure make it again. I like how easy it is to put together. It would pair well with fried rice, or just steamed rice. I served with Asian veggies."
1369648,126575,2009-11-08,5,"My first time making crab cakes and  it was a success!  BF and friends loved it!  As other reviewers suggested, I added 1 tsp of Old Bay seasoning and used Panko flakes for the outside, while using water crackers in place of saltines.  I added 1/4 tsp of salt to make up for the water crackers (thats all I had).  We ate the crab cakes with the Cajun Remoulade sauce, #322382  recipe as another reviewer suggested.  Great combo. Will definitely make again!  Thanks!"
585739,106715,2007-11-14,5,I made this about 2 weeks ago and its for dinner again. MY husband went CRAZY over it. Its better than his moms chicken which is a HUGE compliment because as we all know men love there mom's cooking! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!
29361,22067,2003-02-17,5,"Instead of fresh green beans, I used frozen pole beans, and the flavor was awesome! Since I'm from the south, I've cooked green beans before with bacon and salt, but that's about it.  I left out the mushrooms, almonds & chestnuts, but the pimentos really added a good flavor, along with everything else! Now with this recipe, we may have green beans (or pole beans) more often! "
704166,73315,2014-02-26,2,"Like so make other reviewers of this recipe I did not fully read the instructions, and took a hardy leap into the mix before looking.  Once I did realize these were not going to look anything like the photo (As I don&#039;t have a doughnut pan, and I don&#039;t think most people do either) I had to make last second decision on what to do with these things.  StrawberryParfait&#039;s review gave me the idea to turn them into coffeecake muffins.  Good base recipe, but you&#039;d get better reviews of you changed that default pic to something more muffin-like."

1186609,166005,2009-07-22,5,"Very good! I used sole filets and panko rather than regular crumbs. No buttermilk, so I thinned yogurt with white wine, also added Tiger Sauce for extra heat. These cooked up very quickly, and smelled awesome. Turned out nice and crispy and basic, just what we were hoping for."

870705,364235,2012-11-05,5,A really good stir fry recipe.  I left out the bok choy and added some frozen corn kernels to the dish.  My only complaint is it seems a little bland........maybe a little crushed red pepper would help.  Made for Fall Pick-A-Chef 2012.
53959,122585,2006-01-08,5,This was really really good. I never thought of using strawberry preserves as an ice cream topping. Much cheaper then the bottled topping. Thank you.
265956,51537,2009-07-01,5,Very good recipe. Thanks for posting!
209715,89992,2009-08-13,5,"This is a great quick recipe to make ,that is ver tastey!
I also cut up chicken breasts into chunks. Used half cream of chicken and half sour cream , clove of garlic,s&p.
Layer the dish as described , putting mixed italain cheese between layers and on top. (about a cup) Sauted chicken til brown and used the scraping from pan bottom! We loved it! Thanks"
141293,164371,2006-05-10,5,Actually made this as bread sticks to go with spaghetti and salad.  I like the garlic in the dough so it doesn't burn in the oven.  Also added Italian seasoning for additional flavor.  Thanks Kitz!
240552,283080,2008-02-22,4,These were yummy biscuits!  I made half a recipe and the kids ate every single one of them.  I omitted the pecans due to family preference.  I had to add a little additional milk for consistency.  Thanks!
634850,35988,2007-11-05,5,Fantastic soup....I wouldn't change a thing....So fast & so tasty.
305531,290061,2013-03-20,5,Yummy drink. I copied Boomie and Annacia and used Kahlua and canned whipped cream. So simple and good. Thanks for sharing. Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag.
1273273,98867,2010-04-29,5,"Wow!  What an amazing bread.  In the past, I've never had good luck with cinnamon raisin bread, but this is the best!  It's sooo moist and flavorful.  And it really didn't take that long to make. I used the rapid rise yeast and it took half the time to rise.  I did do as some suggested and plumped my raisins in water, used brown sugar instead of cane for the filling, and added more raisins.  I did wind up rolling it into one log, but it still came out great!  I gave two of them away to the two handymen working on my new deck outside.  Will keep this forever!  Thanks!!"
227978,301401,2009-01-29,5,"A very tasty dish. The chicken was moist and tender.  I used the whole can of diced tomatoes, but my pan was so full to the brim that I didn't use the whole 26 ounces of pasta sauce.  Nonetheless, it was positively delicious.  Made for the 1-2-3 Hit Wonders tag game."
98722,225916,2007-05-12,4,A nice change from steamed carrots!  I used garlic powder instead of ginger as I only had fresh.  Thanks!
353485,222261,2009-03-29,4,"I must have the same large glasses as the original poster as indeed this made 4 (large) and very strong (raspberry) servings.  Every sip seemed to bring a comment about the strength of the drinks but that didn't stop anyone -  there was none left, not even in the bottom of the glasses."
526666,382135,2009-07-30,5,"This drink is luscious! I did use diet soda, but otherwise followed the recipe. The taste was great and refreshing, perfect for a hot summer day! I'll be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing, WiGal!"
895132,490821,2014-04-29,5,"OMG, this was good! I used ghee instead of the butter and coconut yoghurt, but otherwise made as written. This was absolutely awesome, and I&#039;ll definitely make it again!! Thanks for sharing.&lt;br/&gt;Made for PAC Spring 2014"
1291672,57130,2010-01-18,5,"YUM!!  This recipe is so easy and delicious!  I added carrots, celery, onions and potatoes all around the roast.  The best part about this recipe is that the sauce thickens itself into gravy so you don't have to do it!  Highly recommended!"
937635,110505,2013-03-09,5,"I love this! Had it at a friend's house and had to make it at home. I did shorten the cook time by sauteeing 2 chicken breasts chopped, onions and after a little, garlic in the oil. Then added the spices, and finally the rest of the ingredients. Used chicken stock instead of water and eye-balled it. Such a good, healthy recipe! Thanks!"
430765,79410,2008-08-06,5,"Yummmmm!  And, super easy!  I used Ghirardelli milk chocolate and heavy cream.  This is a recipe that I will use again and pass along to anyone that asks for it.  Thank you for sharing."
65502,483857,2012-08-05,5,I just love queso fresco and I was happy to find it at a specialty store here. The sauce is terrific and would be very good on chicken as well. Most of my family doesn't like eating corn right off the cob so I just cut the kernels off and put a dollop of the sauce on top. Delish! Made for ZWT8. Thanks IngridH! :)
201752,37797,2005-03-10,5,"Fabulous, spicy, easy to prepare & YUM!  Try this recipe."
176615,125909,2005-09-05,5,"The kids are doughnut connoisseurs, and just gobbled these up. Regular doughnuts are so BAD that they're a rare treat around here, so it's nice to find a recipe that's low fat and still yummy. I used my Donut Express pans, 12 mini and 6 regular size. These are very lowfat so even though the pans are nonstick, they should be sprayed well with cooking spray. I'd suggest checking them early, 8 minutes was just a bit much in my oven for the mini ones. I didn't even let them cool all of the way before glazing. A lovely treat with a cup of coffee. Thanks, mariposa, for posting!"
1138164,73166,2010-03-30,5,"This is a great recipe. Found it to be best when made with Guinness, regular brewed coffee (the strong coffee I used made it bitter) & the full amount of brown sugar."
160974,118080,2006-05-22,5,"I've made these cookies several time (got them from Southern Living magazine). It said that Louise Bodziony from Gladstone, MO won the 1987 state fair with this recipe! The dough slices nicely and you can really see the swirl in  the baked cookie. I have never toasted the coconut and walnuts, but will give that a try next time.

Roxygirl"
231556,28616,2007-06-15,5,Delicious and easy. Definitely worth making again.
68207,25382,2003-01-23,4,"I tried this last night and we liked it.  The only thing I would do differently is put the bread in the oven for a few minutes to toast it before adding the cheese to it.  That's just my preference, I like my bread toasted.  Will definitely make this again."
1530179,95607,2013-01-31,5,"I loved this, my husband liked it. It was my first time doing a double layer breading, but it was like my boneless skinless chicken breast had skin, so I'm a huge fan of the breading. The dish was very moist and rich, I will definitely be making it again, probably when I have company next time."
190399,326421,2009-04-26,5,This was a hit at my house as well. I loved cooking the pasta in the same dish. The pasta was yummy and the sauce was really good. I'll be making this again.
732498,98724,2008-06-11,4,Please also try this with slices of extra sharp cheddar cheese! Don't try to use any of those processed cheese slices.
426903,26210,2010-01-17,5,"Very nice potato recipe, they turned out nice and soft. Thanks for posting"
227652,254374,2008-06-17,4,Lovely!
75490,26760,2003-08-20,5,"Great snack mix, Nurse Di. I did like the other reviewers and made up individual snack bags for me and my kids. I loved the salty-sweet taste. Very addictive. Too bad it isn't low-cal. Oh well, can't have it all."
119445,12619,2004-01-06,5,What's not to like?  All those great flavors and so easy. When served my dh covered his in parmezan cheese. Too good. I had to make this two days in a row in order for us to get our fill!
894666,64446,2016-03-25,5,"Made in the bread machine with active dry yeast, just dumped all the ingredients in. Used the entire amount of flour off the bat. The last few minutes of baking I spread the butter on top and sprinkled on some sea salt and it turned golden brown. Baked on a pizza stone. Wonderful! Couldn&#039;t have been easier!!"
407088,79040,2009-10-18,5,"I just made this and could NOT resist having a small bowl before I put it away for tomorrow night (cub scout night).  My dad has been talking about Shoney's cabbage beef soup for some time now, so he's going to be thrilled, because it DOES taste like it.  I don't typically eat much meat because it doesn't sit well on my stomach, but this, I think I'll just grin and bear.  Thanks so much!

Oh, and I used extra lean ground beef, crushed tomatoes, and beef consume mixed with water to make up the broth."
249867,111839,2009-02-23,4,"These were very good, and healthy tasting with the oatmeal.  They didn't rise much for me though. Also, 20 min. at 400 was way too long. 
But the cranberry and walnut bits with oatmeal made them a filling breakfast through the week."
291612,123565,2006-02-07,5,"I looked at the 15 kiwis on the sink a friend gave me and read this recipe.  Majority rules so I tried it, made a double batch.  It;s awesome and I will make this again and again and again"
1242436,276879,2009-04-18,5,Was very easy and very good. Thanks for sharing!
609195,31073,2007-10-08,5,"Great recipe, tasty, fillable! Pretty easy to make. Recommend big time!"
461834,536384,2018-07-26,5,"Wonderful, tasty, buttery biscuits!! I cut the recipe in half, and made as written except for adding some chopped chives!! So good. I used my ice cream scoop for making the drop biscuits, but they were on the small side, so next time I will just hand form them to the size I want, lol!! Thanks for sharing this yummy biscuit recipe."
239596,18817,2005-09-15,0,"I make one very similar to this, but use yogurt instead of the mayo.  I mix oregano and basil into the yogurt."
804550,370283,2011-03-24,5,"WOW! Simply delicious! Such an easy recipe! Unfortunately I couldn't wait for it to totally freeze up hard so I ate it when it was what folks in New Jersey call soft serve or custard! I also used French vanilla ice cream for the base. Since I used black berries and the family has a dislike of the seeds, I strained the seeds out with a mesh strainer. A super treat! Made for Veg 'N Swap tag."
354725,206878,2009-10-02,4,"These were very good; I love to find a healthy cookie that tastes great!  I'll make one recommendation--use green lentils, not french lentils.  I used french and they didn't puree up as I'm sure green lentils would, so I had lots of whole lentils in my cookies.  They tasted fine that way, but I didn't share them with anyone because of it."
333017,232055,2010-07-23,5,"Wow!  I usually don't go too crazy about veggies....but this was so good!  The first time I tried Swiss chard, my DH was not too keen about it (I didn't quite get it cooked enough).  This recipe was the deciding factor....like or dislike?!?!  Well, you sold him (and me, of course!!)  The lemon really makes the dish shine through!!  Kudos on a great find and thanks for passing it on!!"
137302,412079,2012-04-19,5,These were very good even if you didn't dip them in the salsa.  The only thing I did differently was that instead of putting in the black olives I substituted some finely chopped lunch meat ham.  I refrigerated them overnight near the top of the refrigerator for best chilling.  Flavors blended wonderfully.  Made for PAC Spring 2012.
2000169383,70522,2015-04-27,1,I followed instructions and I didn&#039;t like it at all
524709,172647,2009-02-05,5,"Not only was this very simple, DH says it was the best pizza I have made.  I needed a pizza crust that did not require yeast because I was in a hurry and didn't want to go to the store.  I was skeptical at first but was proved wrong.  I will make this crust regularly now.  Thanks"
257993,120258,2006-06-20,5,This is very good.  The only thing I did different was double the recipe.  Thanks.
437237,506,2008-03-04,5,"This turned out very well! I did cut back on the cheese to 2 cups, and may leave it out the next time I make it. We all enjoyed this :-)"
39301,146882,2009-04-11,5,"Very good! Thanks for posting this. Now I can have a quick and guiltless cup of Chai tea whenever I want! Yum!  Like another reviewer, I used just one cup of Splenda and it was perfect."
420166,294849,2008-12-01,5,"These were great!  I used velveta cheese for the cheese cube.  I also used a mixture of ground beef/ground turkey.  We could only fit 3 meatballs on each bun, so we ended up with 6 sandwiches.  Served these on hoagie buns and they were a huge hit!"
381144,63712,2008-05-27,5,This was my first time making meringue and it came out very well.The only thing I did different was that I made a graham cracker crust.This was totally delicious.It was definitely worth the effort.
37449,436624,2012-04-07,5,Delicious! I used decaf tea and really enjoyed this on a hot April afternoon. Made for PRMR.
28636,96111,2010-02-28,5,"A classic.  This has been my go-to recipe for many years on those Sunday nights after a busy weekend.  They are so quick and easy to make for another week of school lunches.  Now that the children are older, they can make them themselves!  Thanks Bec."
35965,37235,2002-09-09,5,"I substituted fresh red potatoes shredded and partially cooked (hash brown like) for the tator tots. (Only because I'm not in to prepackaged foods.)  It was delicious! DH and I both agreed we will definitely be having this one again.  In fact, he specifically said, ""I sure hope you make this one a lot.  It's really good!""  Thanks for sharing this recipe Mark!!"
66008,161349,2006-03-04,4,I would never have dreamed these had all the ingredients in them that they did. Very tasty!
195175,180192,2007-02-23,5,"Love this recipe, Riffraff!!! DH and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I followed the recipe exactly. I did add mushrooms and onions to the kabobs and basted them as they grilled. The flavors were well balanced and didn't overpower the shrimp. I am so glad I found this recipe and plan on making it often."
211933,38953,2010-03-07,5,"WOW! This lemon loaf is amazing!! I doubled the recipe and added 1.5 cups frozen cranberries and it turned out so well. I have guests coming tonight, so I will have to hold out, but it's going to be very difficult. Really great recipe."
632249,119732,2014-03-06,5,This recipe is similar to the Low Carb Pizza that we love so much.  I did reduce the cheese in the &quot;topping&quot; portion of the recipe and it was still yummy.  I put the crust ingredients together earlier in the day and chopped up my toppings so that everything would be ready to go at dinner time. Very good and easy to make too. Thanks Mercy!
241385,52556,2005-12-17,4,Yummy!! Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone was pleased. Can't wait to make it again for Christmas.
128473,365502,2011-08-29,5,"Another winner from Lalaloula.  Your biscuits and scones never disappoint.  These were lovely.  Made exactly as written.  Loved the addition of the honey.  A lovely light, tender, semi sweet scone.  I can't wait to make these again, they were wonderful served with soft butter and pansy jam. Thanks so much for sharing."
919195,2510,2008-11-27,5,"Wonderful recipe! I made this in three small loaf pans and I'm taking one to my sister tomorrow when we go to her house for Thanksgiving dinner. It will make a great breakfast treat with a good cup of coffee. I used a cream cheese glaze on mine and it complements the bread beautifully. Love this, thanks for sharing the recipe."
2002053457,14537,2018-03-16,0,How do I print this recipe??
389431,111257,2007-06-27,1,"This just didn't cut it for my husband and I. We followed the directions and didn't stray, but we still couldn't eat it. I guess we are spoiled by the all day sort of chicken and dumplings.  We liked the idea, but it just really didn't work for us."
2002138875,132765,2018-05-02,5,"I loved this dish, no garlic added added butter instead of olive oil i made it as a side for dinner and oh my delicious. It was so good i had to have a bowl for lunch.."
50969,59773,2003-08-31,5,"well, i was going to post
this.but it just seems that
great minds think alike :).i've also tried this with peanut butter chips. works great!!!"
50969,22128,2002-10-21,5,"this is just sooo!!!! good everytime i make this my son will eat what's left.
thanks

131126,160336,2006-07-11,3,"These have wonderful flavor!  I had a hard time in cooking them however.  My deep fryer was at 325 so I know the oil was hot enough.  The balls simply wouldn't hold together and several disintegrated completely. I used frozen spinach (thawed & squeezed dry) and formed the balls smaller than golf balls. I will try these again, but try thickening them a bit more or maybe I will shape into small patties and see if that works better for me. Thank you Rita for sharing a tasty recipe! "
80998,378406,2010-01-09,5,"These are awesome!  I made them exactly as stated and wouldn't change a thing.  They were a bit time consuming to make, but so worth it.   These went great with our after dinner coffee last night."
333017,35805,2009-11-05,3,"While this recipe is easy to put together using the bread machine....I had problems rolling this out.  There was no way that that piece of dough wanted to be round...no matter how many times I attacked it!!!  As for the taste, well...that part was very good!!!  I might search around to see if I can find a dough that is a little bit more forgiving!!"
879716,126978,2009-05-30,5,I used this recipe to make a whole lot of meatballs and froze them in batches for later use.  I just used a bag of thawed meatballs to simmer in wizkid's Recipe #97674.  So good!  Thanks for this recipe Deb - I'll have to try your gravy soon :)
2191027,474521,2012-02-28,5,Made the recipe over the weekend when breezermom e-mailed me the recipe to try.  It was chilly and rainy and this hit the spot.  Very pretty too.
233583,256080,2011-01-08,5,"Great pizza dough and so easy to get together.  DS said it is one of the best yet and he is a connosieur!  I made a large 16"" pizza on the stone, 1/2 with steak and onions and 1/2 with artichoke hearts, brocolli, and onions.  YUMMY! Made for Aus/NZ Swap 37.  pics to follow<br/><br/>OMG  I made this again for the AUS/NZ Swap and did not realize I had done it before.  Well it again gets 5 stars.  Made for pizza night here and this time topped with shredded BBQ chicken, onions, peppers, olives.  DH and I gorged on it and had leftovrs for lunch the next day.  I made 1 16"" thick pan pizza and added in mozzerella cheese to the crust rolling it over itself so the cheese oozed out for each bite.  GREAT! (edited to add stars in they did not show for some reason)"
108416,176594,2006-08-22,5,Excellent! I made this in the crock pot and cooked it for 6 hours on low. I added a tin of mushrooms and thickened it about 1/2 hour before done.
343228,89877,2007-01-26,5,turned out perfect. i used butter instead of ghee and still was amazing. i loved this. the only issue was that i had to wash my hair twice after making it coz the smell of all the spices caught on.
2321218,182660,2016-03-07,5,"As a big fan of pineapple we loved this recipe, not only did we love it, it was super easy to make. The only thing I did different was used fresh ginger. Will make again"
1579854,131018,2011-01-29,5,"Great recipe though I was less than optimistic about the ingredients.  I was suspicious of the extremely fatty pork cut which I had.  But you're right--the fat melted away.  And, I thought the BBQ sauce would be overpowering.  Again, I was surprised.  I began by adding just a few tablespoons of BBQ sauce and then sampling.  I ended up adding three quarters as much as the recipe calls for and still the BBQ flavor seemed mild.  Thanks for a keeper."
1072593,224758,2011-07-29,5,"I just loved this!  I don't even know where to start, so just know that I loved this.  Made for All You Can Cook Buffet--Special Event Tag."
233839,147161,2009-12-20,5,"Very pretty colors in this cookie --  I too used red & green cherries.  Be careful of the timing, though...  one pan burnt a little on the bottom.  They taste great just out of the oven.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!"
93417,95002,2004-10-08,5,"New favorite! To avoid the beans rolling around, I used the bottom of a glass to ""smash"" -- just a little. Extra special with Jalapeno Jack Cheese.  Second time I made this, I mistakenly put the butter in the frying pan to melt, then used the brush to get it up on the tortilla -- this saved a step.  Mahalo nui (thanks much) for this recipe!"
375111,16687,2007-03-07,4,"This was sooo easy & really tasty!  I didn't read the past reviews in time, but I added the corn & beans in the beginning & had no problem with that at all.  I did use 32 oz of salsa, but would probably cut it to 16 oz next time so it's a bit more meaty & less juicy.  The taste, however, was awesome!!!!  Both my husband & I loved it rolled up in flour tortillas with a little sour cream, diced avocado & shredded cheddar cheese......can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!"
627420,265329,2008-06-01,5,I made to bring to my friends graduation party.  They went over BIG!  Anyone that loves tacos will enjoy these.  Thank you Linda for posting this for us!  Michelle
134624,70165,2004-05-18,4,"I froze this dough for about a week before using. It still came out very nice, nice and crisp where it needed to be with no funny ""bready"" taste. I made one pizza on a pizza stone, and one on a metal pizza pan. The one baked on the stone most definitely came out crisper and better. I will be making this again next week using for calzone dough. It's a keeper!"
688338,121999,2008-02-16,5,"Made this the other night and it was sensational! Absolutely delish and the best thing ive eaten in ages... will make this again and again and again. I used pork belly and cooked for about 30-40mins as I prefer the flavour of the belly meat plus its more tender than ribs.... there was lots of sauce to drizzle over the rice too and yes, oh my........."
83093,57015,2006-10-26,5,"I'm pretty sure that by law in most southern states, grits must be served with butter, sugar & cream.  When Twissis chose this recipe as part of our cooking expedition, I gave her my famous squinty-eyed-head-cocked-sideways-I-remain-unconvinced-we'll-get-arrested look, but hey, she's the guest so I took the risk.  Assembly was a snap.  I used quick cooking grits prepared in the microwave. The chorizo I found wasn't in a casing - just a roll like plain old breakfast sausage & she had precooked it to use part in another recipe so I was saved from the casing removal/frying experience. Other than cooking the veggies, it was work free.  And, OK, I'll admit it - I liked them. Twissis was right again.  Thanks for posting!"
411647,15875,2011-12-12,4,Just made this last night to use up some roasted chicken and it hit the spot.  Creamy goodness all around.  I pretty much made it as called for.  The Cayenne added quite a kick so if someone doesn't like spicy maybe cut that down a little bit.  Pretty much made enough for 4 full meal size servings for me.
89310,56413,2003-07-16,5,Very tasty. I added a cup of mixed sliced mushrooms.
838515,192600,2014-02-14,5,"These were AWESOME cookies!! We cut out hearts for Valentine&#039;s Day, and topped them with pink frosting. Sooo good. Thanks for sharing. :)"
2002122066,263857,2018-04-19,0,sorry but Scottish tablet is not fudge...fudge and tablet are two very different things over here in Scotland
311203,387540,2010-06-22,5,These were a yummy summer treat!  My BF says these are his favorite out of all the bars that I make.  They are also one of the easiest.  I used 3 chocolate bars but added 6 ounces of peanut butter chips.  I baked them for 30 minutes and they turned out perfect!  Thanks for the recipe.
263542,73425,2006-12-22,5,"This was always my favorite frosting growing up- a special treat that I required on every birthday.  Today I still make sure I get a cake with White Mountain Frosting on my birthday every year.  My kids have caught on to the tradition, and it's their number one request as well.  I just make a white or yellow cake, drizzle some sweetened condensed milk on top of each layer and frost with this special frosting.  Sometimes I will top it off with coconut.  Yummmm!"
83093,166973,2006-09-05,5,"The best cucumber salad I've ever tasted! I used fresh parsley & dill plus 1 packet of Splenda for the sugar.  It was perfection!  The creamy dressing would taste great on any salad!  Thanks, MP!"
242122,248912,2007-12-21,5,"This is my new favorite condiment!  I mixed some up to have with Tyson Southern Style Chicken Nuggets and loved it. It was also pretty good to dip french fries in.  I've also had it with rotisserie turkey breast from the store, and I imagine it would be great with pork roast.  I also think it might make a great sauce for Vitello Tonato (poached cold veal breast with tuna sauce), based on recipes I've read for that particular dish.  I might even brush it on some cod fillets before baking them.  I didn't follow the proportions of ingredients really; I just started mixing them together until I got the taste and consistency I liked.  I added a little lemon juice, too, as several recipes for the sauce called for it.  I do think it's really quite optional, though.  Thank you for this one!"
620763,348261,2010-02-08,3,"This recipe received rave reviews on the Food Network site, but I had some problems with it. The dough was incredibly wet after adding the full cup of buttermilk, and I had to keep adding flour to get it to come together. I barely got 7 biscuits out of it and they were not even close to 1 inch thick. No way would I come close to getting the 10-12 as the recipe states. Plus, I thought they were very bland, tastless biscuits. On the bright side, they rose nice and I did like the texture of them, I just wish they had more taste."
2000153396,199209,2015-10-07,0,This recipe and ingredients were possibly the worst combination and taste I have ever experienced in a recipe.  The odor and consistency with curdled sour cream were the worst.  What was I thinking to make this disaster?  Please just take this recipe off your usually wonderful list.
82616,105016,2006-02-12,5,"Nummy !!!!!
This is a wonderful recipe thanks Ev :)"
255394,120159,2005-10-25,5,"Very easy and delicious using a 12"" thin Boboli and about 6 oz smoked gouda.  I also added some thinly sliced red onion.  Yum."
381333,36127,2007-07-02,5,"We were given some really large shrimp this weekend and I decided on this recipe to cook them. I'm so glad I did. I had all of the herbs growing in my ""earth boxes"" and this was fun to make. Will definiely make this again. I served it with pasta, but will try yellow rice next time."
2000732626,111151,2016-12-21,0,This was the biggest hit with pork roast ever !!
186070,117483,2007-11-30,5,"Love this one, it brings back so many childhood memories when my parents entertained and would make these for their guest and we kids would always sneak a sip, I recently was visiting a Canadian friend and low and behold she served this refreshing classic.  Thanks for the post and the memories."
303700,265538,2007-12-01,5,Made for Photo Tag Fall/Winter 07 These are easy to prepare and quite tasty.You could even add some thawed frozen peas to add another dimension or some chopped mushrooms.I used egg roll wrappers because thats what I had on hand but a won ton wrapper would make a nicer size for a little appy.
98919,63860,2005-10-04,5,"Eggs in the microwave are nice and fluffy.  I've done a lo-cal version, by using a cooking spray (easier clean up)...water or skim milk...(no butter)and my favorite seasonings. (California-style onion powder a must!!)  Still makes for great eggs. I love the convenience and no mess! "
158086,61962,2007-08-05,5,We loved this! It was so darn easy....but I forgot in my haste (or it could have been the martini I was sipping while cooking) to put in the cheese...still was great even without it...Next time I will lay off the martini's and add the cheese...
586037,19393,2008-04-04,5,"Super Yummy.  My kids LOVE it.  It's definitely a 13x9 pan recipe, though.  Otherwise, perfect as is."
99624,71739,2007-02-21,5,Loved it!
301002,29709,2009-04-09,5,"Great recipe!  Easy and everyone loves it.  

I sweated the onions in a tablespoon of the bacon grease and then added an ample helping of shredded baby-back rib to the beans.   MMMmmmmm....."
778484,146373,2008-08-24,5,"These potatoes were excellent, we grilled them over charcoal in tin foil and the flavors were outstanding.  We added fresh onions instead of the onion powder and used olive oil instead of oil.  And we are having them again tonight, we are thinking of adding bell pepper and crumbled bacon.  Let you know how it turns out.  Thank you for another outstanding recipe."
2324285,486236,2014-03-01,5,This was a delicious stew.  I used chile-stuffed olives and didn&#039;t add the feta until the very end.  The sauce was perfect over couscous.  I overcooked my chicken at 6 hours- I probably should&#039;ve checked it after five hours.  Still tasted great though!
92913,288922,2008-03-24,5,"My family really enjoyed this. I doubled everything, but followed recipe exactly. Thanks!"
2550275,279234,2013-02-07,5,This recipe was a first for me and it will definitely not be the last time I cook this. We absolutely loved it.  I didn't change a thing except I omitted the can of mushrooms because of my picky eaters.
397519,7461,2008-03-28,5,"WOW- what a pie- easy and incredibly rich.  My Dad loves p-nut butter pie so, I made this for him on his b'day. I have made this pie several times now and it always goes over well with everyone.  For extra pizzaz I double the filling and top with crumbled reeces p-nutbutter cups, then  the whip cream and garnish with 1 more p-nut butter cup on top.  None of the other pies got touched when this was on the table!  Just make sure you take enough to go around and a copy of the recipe because someone always requests it!"
38865,58070,2003-09-12,4,This qualifies as good old fashioned comfort food.  I did have to add extra liquid and extend the cooking time.  We really enjoyed this soup and will make it again.
369284,76143,2011-10-18,5,"Very, very good!! I thought I had cranberries, but they were dried cherries~and they were great anyways! ;) We will have this again soon--so perfect for Autumn."
382071,267535,2010-11-12,3,"I had a huge bag of Fuyu persimmons from my inlaws tree so went looking for recipes. There aren't very many recipes for this type of persimmon. I made this as directed with cinnabon bread and added golden raisins. The recipe didn't say to peel the persimmons, and some people do eat the skin, so I didn't...I wish I did...the skin ended up giving the whole thing the texture of dried shredded coconut which I dislike. It didn't have much flavor and wasn't sweet enough. Sadly, we ended up throwing most of it out. If I were to make it again...I would try peeling and dicing the persimmons and adding extra brown sugar and spices."
148903,21051,2004-12-12,4,"An OK recipe, but not sure if I would repeat.  We added a bit of hot sauce for more zip."
143318,330910,2008-11-03,5,"Oh boy is this pasta good-with the crusty delicious edges like baked ziti! This recipe caught my eye when I read through the Craze-E Crockpot Contest entries, but I didn't think it would work. How could the turkey burgers be fully cooked (let alone good?) just sitting on top on low. I was skeptical of the Mac and Cheese since I struggled to make my own entry work, and it definitely required stirring. When I saw this come up as a finalist in the contest, I was completely intrigued! This made not only delicious, juicy, flavorful burgers that were perfectly cooked but also absolutely fantastic pasta - spicy, cheesy, full of mushrooms and crusty to perfection-which I don't think would have been achieved if it were stirred. (I couldn't get back to the crockpot for a full 3 1/2 hours.) I love this recipe and will definitely do this again-besides the perfect blend of flavors, I really like only having to wash one pot! I will likely delete the bacon and definitely use cooking spray first,to reduce clean-up. This is a very clever recipe conjured up by a crockpot genius!"
381180,365505,2012-02-17,4,"Quick and easy ~ and tasty!  Next time I'll reduce the butter to 2 tablespoons, and use the juice of half a lemon along with the lemon slices.  I baked my Tilapia at 425F for 15 minutes ~ Made for Cooking from the Pantry, Freezer, and Fridge 2012."
696326,183270,2008-02-15,5,"We made this with Giada's marinara recipe & it was flawless!! I found the sauce & meatballs makes good pasta topping, thanks for sharing! :D"
427184,82546,2007-05-12,4,"What flavour! These aren't your ordinary scrambled eggs. I served this with some toasted rye bread, and I did use lime at the end as well. Thanks for a great breakfast."
403396,71580,2009-03-25,5,"I rarely dine at buffets, especially those that are bound to attract children, but I do have a Hometown Buffet in my neighborhood. I've long loved this dish but didn't know what it was called. I also didn't have much luck getting the name of it, let alone a scoop  of it, on  my visits to my local HB. They rarely make it and when they do - it's gone in a flash! I just happened to be looking up nutritional information for something else and realized that was the  perfect way to get the name of this recipe - by scrolling their nutritional pages, then immediately found it on the 'Zaar here and made  it for breakfast! Awesome! Just like the stuff in the restaurant! By the way, if you are a fan of Hometown Buffet, you can get buy one get one free coupon if you sign up for their eClub on the website. They haven't spammed  me yet and the coupon is printable, good for two weeks and is in  your inbox  the next morning. So on your way to buy the cream  to make this, you can stop at HB with a friend and fill up on fruit and roast beef!"
622972,83624,2008-09-18,5,This stir fry sauce was really good - better than those sauce mixes I have used in the past.  I had all of the ingredients on hand and it was quick.  Thanks!
1399941,391864,2009-09-30,5,This recipe is very-very good.  My family loved the fish cooked like this.  THANK YOU!!!!!!!
839753,139596,2012-11-07,5,"Oh man, these are delicious. I made quite a few substitutions, and it still turned out great. <br/><br/>Brown rice instead of white. <br/>I only had 1/8 cup of heavy cream so I made up the difference with milk (I ended up using 1/4 cup less milk than this recipe called for, so a total of 1 1/8 cups milk and 1/8 cup cream). <br/>I also used salted butter, a pretty cold egg, and raisins. <br/><br/>I topped each muffin with a sprinkling of cinnamon and slivered almonds. Mmm!"
171171,481146,2015-01-06,5,"We loved these cookies. I only had light brown sugar, so I used that, and increased the baking soda to a full teaspoon. My only problem was that after 10 minutes in the freezer, the butter/sugar mixture still was not cool, and after adding the flour and oats, the dough was still very sticky and there was no way I would have been able to roll it into balls. Added to this, even with all other ingredients added, the dough was still warm enough that it melted the chips a bit when I added them in. We ended up putting all of the dough in saran wrap, wrapping it up, and putting it in the freezer for about 30 minutes. By then it was cool enough for me to handle and I was able to roll it into balls. This recipe ended up making about 30 cookies, rather than the 24 that the recipe specified. Love them, though, and will definitely make them again."
8688,54448,2006-07-20,5,"These little shots are a whole lot of fun and pretty tasty, too!  It's easy to down several of these little babies without realizing just how much you are having.  Dan'l told me to tell you, Miss A, ""Shame on you for contributing to the delinquency of the Over 50 Set!"" LOL!! It's all in fun : )  Thanks so much for the laughs and these delicious little Jello Shots, Miss Annie......and always remember, Don't Eat Jello Shots and Drive ; ) "
198601,28091,2007-08-28,4,"This turned out ok.  Needed a little extra, so i mixed some PB into the top half which added flavor and sprinkled with chocolate chips.  Next time may try nuts instead."
954139,258679,2008-12-23,5,"The sauce is so meaty and delicious we all had seconds and couldn't wait to have the leftovers for lunch the next day!  The sauce is outstanding and in 1st place at our house.  This is my new recipe for sauce and the others are packed away in my recipe box!  I can't wait to make your spaghetti pie, it sounds so good!"
1245096,59635,2010-01-31,5,"I was seriously EXTREMELY leery about making this one!!  I've made salsas before but never with these ingredients.  I've never used canned anything to make a ""fresh"" salsa...but this was GOOD!  Probably one of the best salsa recipes that I have tried.  I made it EXACTLY as indicated...  I even included the sugar.  It's such a small amount that all it really does is slightly cut through the acidity.  You can't even tell there's sugar in it!  Delicious!  I will be making this on a weekly basis!"
1262836,26370,2010-05-21,5,"ItÃÂ´s a delicious and very easy cake to make. The only change I make is in the icing, which I switch from buttercream, to chocolate to almond fondant. Thank you very much for the recipe."
2573508,244193,2012-12-19,5,"This cheesecake is so amazing that I had to register on this site and thank you! Absolutely delicious!<br/><br/>Thank you for all the tips about pan preparation, about the water bath and the trick with the dental floss. This made my cheesecake come out beautifully. <br/><br/>I am on a gluten free diet and I learned to choose great deserts that simply don't contain wheat to begin with instead of fighting that losing battle of trying to simulate wheat in a wheat recipe.  I made thischeesecake for my birthday. It was so good, I made it for an office Christmas Party. It was a huge hit!  <br/><br/>I added quite a bit of extra lemon juice, not because your recipe was lacking, but because I'm a lemon fanatic and I served it with fresh raspberries. Perfect combination!"
2001386266,91266,2017-02-10,5,"this was amazing! i didn't have any basil so i substituted it for oregano spice and it worked nonetheless! i was in such a jam figuring out what to make for dinner since we had an unexpected guest and all i had was chicken, peppers, and onions. ha!"
1802723570,13162,2014-05-07,0,I don&#039;t care how many rapturous reviews you have for this recipe: the broth tastes terrible cooked this way. There are many recipes for mussels on the internet and they all agree that you should saute the shallots and garlic in butter (or olive oil) before adding the white wine etc. Otherwise you are simply boiling them and they turn out bitter. Addition of cream might help but why do it this way? It is interesting the number of reviewers who say they loved the recipe and yet they changed it substantially. Apparently boiled onions can substitute for boiled shallots. I never usually write reviews but in this case I would like to save people from this recipe.
128541,154996,2008-11-26,5,"I love this recipe, it is a staple for our holiday tables. Thanks for sharing here!"
244082,73274,2008-11-27,3,"As I have never made caramel apples before, I decided to do a test run.  The first time I made these, they turned out great. I placed the apples on a silicone mat and life was great.  The second time I made these, the time when it counted, didn't work out so great.  The caramel came up to temperature really quickly, the apples stuck horribly to the greased wax paper and I had to stay up until the wee hours of the morning trying to salvage what I could so I could have something for my son's class.  I love the idea of making these from scratch as the thought of unwrapping a million caramels doesn't excite me in the least!  I am definitely open to some feedback....as I am willing to try this recipe again."
496315,115372,2008-10-25,4,A tasty Mac & Cheese.  My family enjoyed it.  Thank you for sharing!
706608,81465,2009-03-25,5,"Oh Wow! So good! So so good! This is a definate keeper. I didn't read the other reviews first and used 1/2 skim milk and 1/2 2%. It took about 65 minutes to cook but other then that everything went fine! I was a bit worried for a minute when I came back and saw that everyone else used cream. I might try that at some point but this was fabulous with my low fat milk. I let it chill over night, and it popped right out of the pan this morning with lots and lots of caramel sauce! Wonderful. Just follow the directions and you can't go wrong! The caramel cooled off a bit before I got it all out of the pan and formed quite a spider web. I'm sure candy makers are used to this but I thought it was just awesome lol The 8"" pan was full to the seem and ended up spilled over when I tried to move it. Next time I'll use ramekins or a 9"". Thanks soooo much Barb!!"
143318,487397,2013-01-14,5,Green curry is one of my favorites - never thought of adding fish sauce or spinach! I'd love to try more recipes from The Everything Thai Cookbook!
51109,51784,2009-06-23,5,"Rita, I love your recipe for this...so much so that I've merged your recipe with my family's by omitting the sugar, using 2 full cups of honey, lowering the water to 2 cups, adding the juice of the orange as well as the zest, and increasing the vodka to 4 cups.  I also used 1/2 vanilla bean.  Now I can have the best of both worlds!  Took this to a Polish birthday party and everyone loved it.  Not really a summer drink, but my daughter (one of the birthday people) requested it.  Thanks so much. Your spice mix is dead on."
522177,25082,2008-04-29,5,"I like how simple the recipe is! I doubled the recipe (16 cups of flour) and subsituted 4 cups with white for a lighter bread. Salt should never be added directly to yeast, it can ""burn"" the yeast and cause bread to ""flop"" in the rising stage. Add to a small bit of flour and then add into the dough, the flour creates a buffer.  I got 6 med size loaves and a dozen small buns. I make bread twice a week for our large family and although it took longer to make, the taste was uncomparable. I've traded my old recipe for this one."
782307,100281,2010-02-08,5,"Great! I did the lower end of the sugar and it was still a little sweet but good, and the higher end of the cornstarch for tart filling. I used half blueberries half strawberries.
Excellent!"
22724,27515,2002-09-02,5,"These are AWESOME chicken fingers.  The BEST homemade ones we have ever had.  Moist, flavorful, and just the right amount of coating.  We felt these were good enough to stand on their own without the sauce!!  These will definitely be added to our recipe rotation!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!  :)"
104634,46382,2004-01-31,5,"I made this for Christmas eve snacks while waiting for Santa, and let me tell you, one recipe is not enough.  My family literally \"
58892,65340,2003-11-04,5,We liked these ones too!  I made 12 larger rolls instead of the 24. The second time I made them I baked them at 350 instead of 375 - they got too dark too quickly at 375.  Thank you!
840768,51881,2009-10-04,0,"I tried this but didn't do it exactly as written so I will reserve my rating for now.  I'm not a fan of curry either, however, even though I cut the juice & perserves, I found this mango sauce abit on the sweet side.  For us it was missing abit more spicy nature to it, such as cumin or cayenne (that might clash with the mustard though).  Also found there was lots of sauce, enough for 8 breasts."
1114713,169635,2009-01-20,5,I used a big bag of fresh spinach instead of the broccoli and red bell peppers.  I also did not add carrots or bacon and I used shredded velveeta instead of cheddar as this is what I had on hand.  I also didn't have a deep pie dish so I used a small glass rectangle dish that worked fine.  I've made this twice and it is much better if you can wait an hour after it is done to eat it.  Kids and adults alike loved this dish.
226066,215816,2008-03-20,4,This was easy to prepare (steamed my veggies in the microwavwe) and very tasty!!  Thanks Sydney! :)
120069,94991,2004-08-23,5,"This recipe works great. You wouldn't think so, but these taste awesome. My family loved them."
163112,480945,2012-07-30,5,I am so happy :)  This is so wonderful.  This will cure anything that ails you.  Al I had was dark Belgian chocolate but it worked.  ;)  QOTD:  what do you do when you taste your pudding & it's not as sweet as you were expecting?  Add the sugar quick while it's still hot!!  It worked just fine.  And this makes the perfect amount...anough for me to have a huge serving while leaving enough for the 3 of us to have after dinner.  bwahahaaaaa!  Made for ZWT8 Chefs Gone WILD!
207616,248248,2008-07-01,5,"LOVE this corn! It went perfectly with ""Recipe #99245"". Muy Bueno!!!
I did change the method of cooking a bit as I already had a fire going on the grill so I pulled back the husks, applied the butter, tied the husks back on and cooked it on the grill sealing in the flavors of the spicy butter! Delicioso!! ZWT4 with the Babes in S/C America"
25467,19007,2002-03-08,0,"Thanks for the comments!  I, too, found the stew to be very thick, so among some other variations, i reduced the barley quantity from 1 cup to 1/2 cup prior to posting.  Now I went ahead and changed it to 1/4.  Hopefully that should make it just right!  To speed up the prep, I bought as many vegetable as possible already sliced/chopped, and kept the baby carrots whole."
128473,382904,2009-08-14,5,Acadia this was a wonderful dessert. Super flavor and an excellent texture. The strawberries and blueberries really shine in this simple yet elegant dessert. The texture is unlike anything I have ever tried...but wonderful none the less. Can you believe that we were out of chocolate sauce...(to the dog house with me)....so I garnished with cool whip and fresh berries...blueberries for the dh and raspberries for me. Thank you so much for sharing your delicious recipe which will be enjoyed again. Happily made for the Comfort Cafe Coffee Diva/09 ... Long may she reign. :)

80101,51652,2003-03-30,0,I took the first comments seriously and added a teaspoon of Dijon mustard. I also substituted stuffing crumbs for the bread crumbs. I served the chicken on a puddle of Hollandaise sauce with fresh steamed broccoli. Outstanding!
614978,105209,2007-10-18,5,Fabulous taste and texture. A real fall treat. Thank you.
1900301,165430,2014-02-18,5,"I used all-purpose flour, &quot;hot rize&quot; cornmeal and added 1 teaspoon of baking powder as a previous reviewer recommended.  To experiment, mild cheddar cheese was added to the batter for the final waffle.  Additional cheese was sprinkled on top after cooking.    Next time, I&#039;ll try pepper jack cheese or sharp cheddar.  The mild cheddar wasn&#039;t strong enough to stand up to the cornbread.  The recipe itself is awesome though.  My father makes the greatest corncakes which are cooked in bacon grease.  This is a much healthier option, they&#039;re just as tasty and less hassle too."

It did, IMHO, need *something* and I was really uncertain what that something was.  I was thinking more Dijon, but I'm seriously glad I went with the sour cream (well, actually, don't tell my DH, but it was yogurt--the bazillion calorie high fat kind so it isn't like I was going for health with the substitution--it was just what I had on hand).  I can't describe exactly what it did except to ""round out the flavor"".  It seemed to tangy/sour and the yogurt really softened it up and made it GREAT!***<br/><br/>(Original review) I did add about 2 T tomato paste because I had some to use up and I thought that the tomato would work and play well with the beef, beer, mustard, etc.  I think I was wrong or this beef stew is just too tangy for me.  It just didn't taste like I hoped or expected, but the tomato paste could definitely be the problem, so I'm not blaming the recipe as is.  I am big into beef burgundy or mexican flavored pulled beef and wanted something different which this definitely is.  My husband likes it, so no complaint on that count."
176615,45390,2009-01-01,5,"We love meringues and these were gone in a flash. Used mini chips as suggested. After a few hours, they were still soft inside so I turned the oven on to 250, then turned off and left all night. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
2000912998,57059,2016-03-14,5,"It&#039;s hard to get excited about pot roast. I thought pot roast is pot roast is pot roast. Not so with this recipe. It&#039;s a &quot;10&quot; and a keeper for sure. I tweaked it a little by doing the following:  I always marinate venison in Coke overnight b4 cooking. The Coke tenderizes the meat and removes the gaminess of venison. It does not impart any sweetness to the meat. Just rinse off the meat b4 cooking. I used fresh baby Bella&#039;s instead of canned shrooms. And I added 1/4 cup of soy sauce to add a little extra depth of flavor. I skipped the potatoes bc we served the roast and vegetables over garlic roasted mashed potatoes. I also salt and peppered the roast and seared it in a skillet before cooking everything in a crockpot on low for 7 hours. My wife, who grew up eating pot roast after church every Sunday and turns her nose up at pot roast, said it was the best pot roast she had ever eaten.  Will make this again many times."
17803,48477,2004-07-11,5,"My son (9 years-old) has been salivating for days now, waiting
 to try this recipe.  Finally, I helped him make it this morning and he said, ""weâd have to make it again"".  It is an easy and tasty omelette to make.  I liked the addition of the salsa.  Make your first step the draining of the salsa so as much of the liquid will drain off as possible before adding it to your omelette.
"
486725,482619,2015-06-03,4,"Made the horseradish version, and loved the flavor it added, but I definitely had to increase it to be able to taste it (if I had made a full recipe it would equate to my adding 3 tablespoons). I used horseradish, not horseradish sauce though, so I would think you would need to add even more if you were using the sauce. But in order to compensate for not using the sauce, I did add 2-3 times the mayo. With a little tweaking, this is a definite keeper."
315055,137080,2015-01-13,5,Delicious!  Would definitely make again in a heartbeat!
2000311830,131643,2015-07-03,5,"I tried this recipe and our guests loved it. Now, I have a new recipe to use for school functions."
356713,48490,2007-12-09,5,"brought this to a family gathering and it went over really well. I thought it looked really nice after I rolled it in chocolate chips.  Served with graham sticks and cinnamom cookies. I will be making this again for sure, probably for New Years Eve!!"
1925885,452468,2012-04-12,5,"This recipe was very good, it tasted alot like a good Pad Thai.  I gave it five stars because of the taste - it was wonderful.  The only thing that was a bit confusing was knowing when to add the veggies and the noodles.  I assume it was step 3, because everything worked out fine.<br/><br/>I made this while our son was visiting and everyone thought it was very good.  How good was proved the following morning when we found him eating the Asian noodles - cold and straight out of the fridge!  Made this for PAC Spring 2012.  Thank you, Hedgiehog for three wonderful recipes!!!"
4470,40444,2004-09-09,5,"Love this recipe - minimum ingrediets, great finished product!  I did add 1 tsp dry  Chili pepper and that did give a perk! I marinated them from 6 AM until 5PM. & the flavor was infused even after this short time. Easy recipe with great results. Thanks Diggy for a definate DO AGAIN recipe"
183964,504921,2015-05-22,5,Great crunchy batter! Love it! It&#039;s just like the kind of batter I like to make.
80733,11830,2004-08-11,4,"We have a weekly organic veg box and we never know what we're going to get until we pick it up.  Whenever there's beetroot in it, I make this recipe, excellent.  I've made it with basmati rice when I haven't had the proper risotto rice."
53868,105365,2006-05-05,5,"This is far tastier than I was expecting!! Very easy to make (just a lot of chopping). I used more garlic. After cooking for a bit over an hour, I processed it in batches in my Vita-Mix to make a smooth pureed texture. This recipe will lend itself to lots of variation (i.e. different herbs/spices); I'll be making it a lot!"
141654,9165,2009-10-05,4,"I didn't have french onion soup - so I mixed beef broth with onion soup mix.  

FAB.  It was so tender and had a great flavor.  Keeper."
38681,19918,2002-04-22,3,"This recipe looked odd to me at first but I decided to try it (partly because the other reviewer didn't really make this recipe).  I stuck to the recipe with minor exceptions.  I added chopped garlic as well as onion powder plus I added some corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit.  I used a heavy dose of pepper but only a tiny fraction of the salt, plus I used the optional tahini.  The results were very good though not spectacular.  I added more pepper on top and a bit of grated paramasian cheese.  The pepper helped but the cheese didn't add much.  This sauce does have great potential, I think it would be great with curry for a shrimp or chicken curry dish.  For those not on a low salt diet I think this would be even better with the normal salt quanity."
383407,209317,2007-03-11,5,"YUM!  I used the double cut chops, and doubled the brown sugar (my husband loves sweet sauces) and they were out of this world!"
679953,304121,2009-01-05,5,"VERY VERY TASTY !! I used corn, peas, ans carrots. This is a real easy recipe to make.  Other than that I made recipe as written.  Made for a great dinner during the games.  A definate do again recipe."
227675,32147,2015-01-11,4,"The flavor on these ribs is great! Flavorful throughout the meat. I followed the recipe to a t, but sure didn&#039;t get the same results as in the photos. The sauce didn&#039;t stick to the ribs at all, needed some cornstarch to thicken it up even enough to use as an au jus. I think that a lot of the issue may have been from the ribs themselves. They were super juicy and may have been the culprit that diluted my sauce. Will try again, the flavor was great."
182010,127029,2006-01-20,5,Delicious and easy.  And the Italian parsley really adds a great level of flavor.  Had these with Hope's Green Rice (#143499)--terrific meal!
95743,3806,2003-10-30,5,"Wonderful!  Delicious, easy to do, quick to prepare and it looks gorgeous.  The perfect recipe.  This tastes more like dessert than a side dish."
212359,155392,2008-07-16,2,"My mom and I did not find this glaze to our particular tastes.  Too much confectioners' sugar and not enough cocoa. We like a richer chocolate flavour.  We ended up adding at least 3 more tablespoons of cocoa, a splash of almond extract, and had to heat it up to get it all to blend well.  Thanks for a basic idea."
2000849550,20352,2016-02-01,5,"This is a great recipe.  The only change I made was to use chipotle chili oil (we have a local chili oil here called Chili Beak, which has an amazing smoky flavor) in place of the crushed red pepper."
240552,254156,2007-11-02,5,"Yummy, yummy!  We had it Tex-Mex Style and what a great treat and change from plain grilled cheese.  I ended up doing 3 sandwiches with 6 pieces of bacon but didn't crumble. I definitely want to try the other types, too!  Thanks for posting, SusieQusie!!"
880889,27210,2010-01-17,5,"I'll add my kudos to the nearly 200 others! This is a great marinade. Followed it to a ""T"" and it was juicy, moist and very flavorful--I would have never thought to use the lemon-pepper onpork! Go figure! thanks for posting."
610268,254299,2011-07-02,5,Fabulous!
2000231169,230754,2016-11-10,2,"I wish that the recipe had mentioned that you need to refrigerate the pretzel and creamy layers for about 1/2 hour before adding the jello portion, which you also needed to let coagulate in the refrigerator for probably about 1/2 hour as well. All layers were room temperature and when I poured the jello and strawberries over the cream layer, the jello drained straight to the bottom pretzel layer and it was a mess. I'm not going to lie, I still popped it in the refrigerator and had some the next day because I'm addicted to this dish, which was always made by my mother and I never witnessed the creation of it. Now I know better and I hope you do not make the same mistake because this is a great crowd pleaser!"
266635,510791,2014-01-20,5,"If you love cabbage, you&#039;ll love this soup.  Loved the sweet and sour flavor and the addition of the golden raisins.  If you want a more substantial meal, you could add some steamed brown rice to your bowl and ladle the soup over it -- don&#039;t forget the dollop of sour cream on top. : ).  Either way, this soup is really delicious.  Made for PRMR, January, 2014."
163112,299774,2009-04-07,2,This didn't really do it for dh & I although the kids liked it.  I served it over tofu sticks instead of chicken.  It was waaaayyyyyy too sweet.  I used close to 1TB chipotke sauce & added extra garlic & onion powder & it was still waaayyy too sweet.  I think Susie D. has a great idea to use some molasses & fresh garlic.  It needs more depth.  I brought it to a boil stovetop for just a minute vs. using the microwave.  That worked well.  Made for PAC 4/09.
806478,51782,2009-03-01,5,It's my second time using this recipe. My family really enjoyed them. I used ground turkey with ground pork and just added a little more of the spices for more flavor. For the sauce I also used a can of tomato soup with the crushed tomatoes and brown sugar. My mom made these alot but didn't serve anything else with them. BUTdon't forget the mashed potatoes. This is a wonderful compliment to the meal. My husband just raved about the meal. Thanks
176160,132186,2009-01-12,5,"OH MY GOSH this is so good, I LOVE IT! My husband is hispanic and loves menudo, but I can't stand it, so I was looking for a good substitute and this is IT! I make this recipe EVERY week now! I like to add an extra can of hominy too. Definately add the squirt of lime, chopped fresh onions and cilantro before serving, that really makes this even more delicioso! mmmmm YUM!"
869184,292165,2010-01-14,5,"What a yummy potato dish! In our house it easily serves 4 people. I cut back on the cheese, only used 1/2 to ligthen it up a bit. Next time I think I will mix all cheese in with the potatoes, I like it better in it than on top. Thank you for sharing this great dish!"
1191081,219454,2010-06-20,4,"I made this in a cherry flavor for my dad's birthday cake. It wasn't as ""buttercreamy"" as I expected from the name, but it was alright. It gets 4 stars because it stayed where it was spread (mostly) and didn't drip all over the place."
2001731834,386983,2017-09-27,1,Boiled over! Made a mess. Had to finish it off on the stove the old-fashioned way.
58937,14811,2003-11-26,5,"I too make an Oyster stuffing, however, I add blanced almonds, do not drain the oysters, and I use Pettridge Farms Rye bread crumb mix.
Your recipe is right on for the Scandenavian crowd!  I made this recipe & I think fresh oysters are better."
185926,187901,2008-11-19,5,"This is EXCELLENT!  Hearty, flavorful and delicious; and easy to throw together.  I did not have allspice so I substituted with some ginger, cinnamon and paprika.  I also added four potatoes because my son doesn't like sweet potato.  This was perfect because there was more sweet potato for the rest of us.  The aroma was intoxicating.  I will make this dish again.  Thank you."
195186,89552,2005-11-03,5,"This has become my go-to recipe for special dinners.  The only change I make is use spagettini #9 instead of angelhair pasta. The spagettini is about 1/2 way between angelhair and regular spagetti.  I also steamed sugar snap pea pods and added then just before plating the dinner.  By the wat, tonight was our 49th anniversary.  
Thanks Kay for an easy and delicious recipe"
1265522,415947,2010-04-02,5,These make a great garnish! I used some on top of a lemon cake and they were fabulous!
250920,136411,2006-03-12,2,The dough is very much like a baking powder biscuit recipe I'm familiar with.  The filling didn't really have much of a sauce in it and the dough didn't match it well either.  This just didn't taste right for us.
443447,35385,2007-12-27,5,Very good.  Will make again & again.  The whole family gobbled them up.
1603130,3745,2010-07-25,5,"These hit the spot!  There are so many blueberries this year in Texas, and this is an incredible way to use them.  I used whole wheat flour, a container of vanilla yogurt (only 6 oz.) and about 1/4 cup skim milk.  Yummmmmm!"
482933,338465,2009-02-22,4,A new and tasty way to fix Italian sausage.  Instead of coring the apple I sliced it with the peel left on.  Loved the apple/onion mixture and timing was right on.   I do think the mustard mixture needs to be reduced but that is a matter of personal preference.  Served ours with Recipe#293119. Thanks loof for sharing.  Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders!
678862,12630,2007-12-19,4,"This is a great casserole that I have had in my collection for a long time.  The only change I amke is that I use my own biscuit recipe, adding additional milk along with the basil to turn my recipe into drop biscuits. Thanks for posting!  : )"
2000210851,118358,2016-02-17,4,These are hard to resist as they taste so fresh and yummy. I may try them again with agave to make it a little healthier.  The  ingredients should include the amount of cucumber and/or length.  I used 1 hot house cucumber almost a foot long and the marinade was too much so you can cut back by at least 1/4 cup of water and sugar.
226863,355525,2012-08-24,5,"Made this while my son was home from college, and he really enjoyed it.  It is spicy, but the sweetness of the coconut offsets the heat.  A big plus was the wonderful smell that filled the house! Thanks for sharing.  Made for ZWT8."
63291,35988,2017-02-13,4,"This was very good. Very tasty and so simple and fast to make. It's definitely on the repeat list. I didn't have spinach or Parmesan cheese but will be trying at a future time with the spinach. I used 1 - 28 oz can diced tomatoes, 1 box reduced salt chicken broth, 1 small onion minced, 1 heaping tsp minced garlic, 2 tsp dried basil, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 pkg (750g size) cheese tortellini."
557659,2498,2009-01-23,5,"This is so good!
Prepared exactly as written, came out perfect.  The pecans are wonderful on top.  This  will become a family favorite.  Thanks for the recipe!"
550557,348114,2014-05-30,5,This is tasty! I had fresh sweet and sour already made up so I substituted for the sour and Sprite. I like that it isn&#039;t too sweet of a drink or too strong.
63128,84807,2004-05-07,5,"Excellent recipe!  So simple yet it tastes like lots of work went into it. I forgot to cut up the mahi and I only let it sit about 10 minutes, but it came out great anyway. I used olive oil instead of canola. I also used bottled lime juice and poured a little extra in the pan after the fish was cooked to drizzle over it.  The pepper gave it just the right kick and the cumin went wonderfully with the lime.  My husband (whose family is from Maui) raved.  "
34880,16769,2002-03-26,5,"Beware when cooking with fire oil!!
The food tasted incredible. It was spicy but still had a lot of flavor."
147109,154388,2006-06-23,4,"These were a bit too different for my tastes, and I am not a huge fan of beans of any sort so I would have given it three stars, but my husband seemed to really enjoy them, so that is all that counts!  Thanks!"
80998,250932,2007-10-15,5,"I loved this smoothie.  I am really trying to be healthier and get all my fruits and veggies in.  This really helped.  I used soy milk instead of 2% for myself , but kept recipe as is for hubby and we both enjoyed it.  Thanks Saturn!  I need to try your other smoothie tomarrow!"
794029,64446,2016-04-24,5,"This is a wonderful recipe! I used some others&#039; advice and substituted olive oil for the butter in the dough and also used about 2 tsp dried rosemary. I made the dough in my bread maker, then followed the directions for the second rise and baking. Brushing with butter at the end and toping with sea salt was a delightful finish. The bread was soft, but easy to cut and delicious. I will use this again and again, with rosemary or other herbs, or even plain. Thanks for posting!"
132221,104394,2004-11-26,4,Great cake!  very moist and tasty.  The only thing I did differently is mix dried and fresh cranberries to the topping. I would definitely make this again.
768321,376575,2010-01-21,5,"I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! Amazing!  I only used about  3/4c of brown sugar and about 4 TB of butter for the filling. And made a 1/2 batch of the frosting and it made enough for the whole batch.  I also used buckwheat instead of millet and cocconut flour for the dusting.  A good tip for cutting cinnamon rolls is by using a piece of thread, slide it under the log cross each side of thread at the top and pull. A perfect cut."
1803237169,423316,2016-01-01,5,"Been making these for years ... but they really need to be baked in a 250 degree oven for about 15 to 20 minutes (stirring once or twice during that time).  Baking gets rid of that greasy feel, but they taste fabulous."
264017,95222,2008-04-26,5,"I'm proud to be the 347th reviewer for this fantastic recipe! I combined several ideas from previous reviewers to give this a 5+ star rating. First, I browned 4 bone-in chops under the broiler, then doubled the sauce using 4 cloves of freshly minced garlic instead of garlic salt. Then I cut slits in each chop to marinate for 4 hours. When ready to cook, I put all in a large frying pan on the stovetop and simmered for 45 minutes, turning the chops every 10 minutes. The sauce turned to a rich, thick glaze and the meat was tender and moist. Thanks Brad!"
189616,43023,2007-07-09,5,"Karen this was awesome-how awesome? Well my eldest DS wanted me to give him 2 more helpings!

Thank You Karen!"
288218,224700,2007-07-22,4,"A great spread, easy and tasty! I served half with crackers and the other half on a rusk, with fresh tomato cubes! The olive oil was so good with the goat cheese! I felt that the clove was overpowering the rest ingredients.  So, next time I'll reduce the ammount a bit. Thanks AmandaInOz!"
450571,7629,2007-06-28,5,"Really tastey, really easy, really pretty.  Will make again!  ZWT3"
340570,167356,2006-08-10,5,This was a good cake.  But the filling was a little runny. It actually made a lot for just a 2-layer cake.  So next time I will add another layer or two.  Above all it was very delicious even though not an exact clone of Olive Gardens Lemon Cream Cake. Still looking for that recipe..
451055,53914,2008-04-01,5,"I thought this fish had lovely presentation.  Can't understand why my teen daughters didn't care for it, but my husband and I loved it.  It will be made in this house often.  Served it alongside rice and we spooned the sauce over it.  The girls liked the sauce - go figure.  I did as another reviewer suggested and added a couple cloves of minced garlic and used fresh basil.  Next time I think I will add more garlic, fresh basil and more Old Bay as we like a little more umph in taste.  Thanks for an easy, quick, delicious fish.  I also added several shrimp to the fish."
2900243,23803,2013-07-13,0,"I made some tweaks and it was almost gone before it completely cooled!!!&lt;br/&gt;I used 6 egges for a more quiche like consistency,  1 small grated potato to help bind the extra eggs and made my own &#039;Bisquick&#039; since I didn&#039;t have any on hand.  I used an 8x8 pan and baked at 350 for 50 minutes.  &lt;br/&gt;Going out to the garden to see if i have another zucchini to make another one!!! so so fluffy, golden and YUMMY!!!!!!!!"
1272144,139664,2010-02-09,5,"Absolutely the best venison ever, and I LIKE venison.  Other reviewer is correct, this is too much marinade, half is about right.  Go ahead and make plenty...it won't last!"
922088,32906,2009-08-24,5,My family loved this salsa.  I used tomatoes from our garden.
36025,29577,2003-06-08,0,KellyD - I am sorry you found these dry - i just can't believe it!  Are you sure you didn't over mix - a common mistake when making muffins.  I have been making these for years - and have never had a negative comment.  Give them another try.
119466,163145,2006-07-03,5,Delicious and healthful--loved it! The only change I made was subbing vanilla yogurt for the plain. Thanks for posting!
2000254196,140466,2015-06-07,5,*RECEIVED RAVE REVIEWS* I made German Chocolate Cupcakes for my nephew&#039;s open house.  I came across this recipe in my search for a filling.  The only thing I did differently was that I put 1/2 of the Coconut &amp; Pecans into a food processor and pulsed several times. I thought this would make it easier to go through the tip for filling.  I think it did somehow make the flavor even better though. :-)  Friends and family asked if I had any spare.  LOL.  This will be a keeper!!
1002864,44888,2012-02-06,5,"bomb! i made this for super bowl and the boys were devouring it. Licking their fingers to savor every single bite! <br/>i would cook this again and again for any occasion. <br/>So easy to make, i mixed everything together and put it on a cookie sheet and i basted it after a 1/2 hr then flipped them. and i kept basting every 10 minutes after that until they were done<br/>so good...."
202661,113525,2005-10-19,0,"I love Tilapia.  I tried it for the first time last week. Merely sauted it in a stick proof skillet with about 1/2 tsp of butter and scarfed it down.  I think if I were to oven bake it, I would put it on my Pampered Chef cooling rack so it would crisp on both sides at one time.  The cooling rack has multiple square grids in it, so it would not let the fish fall through."
446032,137142,2008-08-09,4,My whole family loves this. I definately think it needs to be marinated over night for the full flavor. I skip the vegetable oil and serve with rice and steamed broccoli or sauteed cabbage.
1635242,356632,2012-07-08,5,"This recipe is awesome. And very forgiving to my adjustments. First, I scaled the recipe down to half as much, which I think affected the amount of liquid (I ended up adding about three quarters of a cup of water, in quarter cup increments, at three different times during the simmering). Also, I substituted the portobellos with baby bellas (portobellos are more expensive and this girl is on a budget). The package of baby bellas was labeled as 24 ozs. The mushrooms were so meaty and delicious and I am NOT a vegetarian per se but it was very, very filling and satisfying. Be careful with the  adding chili powder to taste because I think as the chili simmers the flavors will deepen (maybe this is an obvious thing to professional chefs; I am not one of those either). Lastly, I only simmered it for 2 hours because I couldnt wait to eat it... but it was perfectly fine. Thanks Kittencal!"
331581,55768,2006-07-18,5,This was Fabulous!! Everyone in this household loved it!! We sprinkled it with some FF Cheddar and scooped it up with tortillas. I will be making it again very soon. Thanks
806051,142066,2008-03-31,5,"This dough is terriffic!  It was so easy. I used 1 1/2 cup unbleached white, 1 cup whole wheat, and 1/2 cup rye flours and it worked great!"
28177,252960,2010-04-14,5,"This was delish!  I've been sick & really didn't feel much like cooking, but waiting to make this recipe until I felt better seemed to defeat it's purpose.  LOL  It turns out to be really easy to make and it's about the only thing I have been able to eat a serving of since last week.  Not being able to grocery shop required me to improvise slightly.  I had chicken tenders in the freezer, carrot shreds and cilantro, so I subbed those for the whole chicken, the chopped carrot and the parsley.  Without the whole chicken to flavor the soup, I needed to add about a Tablespoon of chicken base.  I think the lime juice was a unique and key addition to this soup & I have no doubt I'll be making it again, well or sick.  And in fact, I think the cilantro paired quite well with the lime.  I may continue to use that in the future.  Thanks so much for sharing your mother's recipe, One Little Deer.  Made & enjoyed for Spring 2010 Pick A Chef.

136828,62136,2008-09-14,5,"Tired of the same old zucchini recipes?  Then try this!  It has so much flavor.  I agree with the reviewer who said it could be a main dish on its own.

The basic recipe is great, but I added a couple of things that I needed to use up.  Added sliced mushrooms to the tomato mixture.  Instead of 1/2 cup parmesan, I used 1/4 parmesan and 1/4 smoked gouda in very small dice.  And because I was out of fresh dill, I used 1 tsp dried.  Came out fine, but I think fresh dill would have given it a little brighter flavor.

All in all, this is a keeper.  Thanks, Kim."
356062,244721,2007-12-28,5,I scaled this recipe down and used low fat sour cream for an awesome dip. The carrots I feel really bring something diffrent to this recipe that puts this dip up a knotch from the other spinach dips posted here.
226863,440309,2011-01-22,0,"I printed the recipe before noticing the honey amount was missing....so subbed what I thought would fit.  Since then, the poster edited the recipe......and wow!  the amounts matched!  This is delicious!"
117974,55796,2008-12-05,5,wow!!!! great soup. I used kidney beans since I didn't have navy beans.  Just wonderful.
2002299666,17823,2018-10-13,5,I go to a Friendship Program during the day and one day a staff member had wanted to make a recipe that a companion for one of the other clients had given her &amp; low &amp; behold it was that recipe I have been thinking about looking it up for quite a while now or asking the staff member who has the class for recipe swap but I keep forgetting to do it. Finally I have looked it up.
46104,307263,2009-11-09,4,"This was very easy and very good.  I left out the peas and artichokes because I don't really care for them.  We didn't have any parsley, so we left that out.  I subbed chicken broth for vegetable broth.  A very pleasing side dish.  Thanks!"
251917,433189,2012-10-23,5,Aussie Swap #69: These drumsticks are so juicy and full of flavor - outstanding!! I cannot wait to make them again!
1355312,301943,2009-10-31,5,Cooked this for my husband. He had three plates of it! I will definitely add this recipe to my dinner rotation!
111313,98377,2004-09-15,5,This was fantastic.  I used creole mustard becuase that is what we like.  I marinated about 2 hours and grilled outside.  Wonderful flavor and very moist chicken.  This will be a staple for our BBQ's next summer.  Thanks for posting.
297546,112831,2008-05-01,5,"Really excellent!  I added a vegetable bouillon cube to the liquid  for a bit more flavor.  Freezes well, too."
926328,145018,2009-01-21,5,"These burgers are wonderful.  My family asked me to make them again, soon.  I used crushed saltines, as it was what I had.

Thanks for submitting."
189156,205957,2009-07-28,5,"This recipe is great!  We're having a heat wave here in the Pacific Northwest and I was looking for something easy and quick to make for dinner.  This did the trick.  I made it as written other than using Lite Miracle Whip instead of Mayo (hubby's preference) and added just a touch of olive oil to the butter in the pan while frying.  Served it was a cold green salad dressed with olive oil and balsalmic vinegar.  May add a dash of hot sauce next time, and there will be a next time.  I'm planning on serving this next week when out of town company is here.  Thanks for sharing!"
133174,8949,2004-07-19,4,"These came out very good.  I added a little olive oil to cook the onions and a touch of water after adding the greens.  Most recipes for collards require them to be cooked for a long, long time.  These were ready in a short time, approximately 20 minutes."
2001763328,213785,2017-10-23,5,"made this last night,,,used 1/2 turkey meat and 1/2 hambuger,, no corn used nalleys jalapeno chili beans and kidney beans,pureed the mexican stewed tomatos,,added diced green chillis...... Came out SO,,,,,,GOOD"
348192,118761,2009-01-28,5,"What a great way to poach eggs, thank you so much. My husband is the egg poacher in our house and laughs at me when I try to make them. I cooked the egg for 50 seconds and did not add vinegar and put a paper towel over the coffee cup and it came out perfect, we like the yolk to be runny. My husband said the egg came out perfect and was impressed that I made a great poached egg. Now I want to fool around and try to make 2 eggs at a time, that would really blow him away! Thanks again.....Debbie"
1189571,27520,2009-05-19,5,"I have made this at least 15 times since I first tried it. It's great, easy, quick and cheap. I add various things depending on what I have, or what I feel like. I always add: Frozen corn, Italian Seasoning. Sometimes, I add: Cheddar, Cajun seasoning, various spices. If I have it, I also sometimes substitute a can of beef broth for the water. It makes it richer. It freezes and saves well, it's great for lunches and goes with many different side dishes. It's great for potlucks, especially when you don't want to spend an arm and a leg. Another cool thing about this is that you can keep almost all of the ingredients in the pantry for a quick meal, without having to go to the store for it."
1276080,11808,2012-02-19,0,This was delicious! Used some white wine to give it some extra flavour since mushrooms and wine is heaven. Thanks for the recipe!
220433,27520,2013-06-05,5,"Super easy, quick and tasty dish. I made it with Ground Turkey and added a can of small White Whole Kernel Corn, an extra clove of Garlic and some Basil. Was enjoyed by all. Will make again. I peppered the meat while browning it and it cooked in nicely. I also added some tomato paste to thicken it and used Hot Rotel instead of Stewed Tomatoes. Kidney Beans are also a nice addition."
153188,115637,2005-04-18,4,"This was good.  Very refreshing. Would rather try the marinade on Chicken breasts next time, I think it'll be spectacular.  Thanks for a great new ""refreshing"" way to do some chicken."
162155,114995,2005-11-03,3,"I was so excited to make this one when I got if off the Pillsbury site, but, we couldn't really figure out why it was the winner.  I can just say the family and I thought it was 'ok', but not something I really wanted again.  We didn't like the way the bits of granola got sticky and chewy the next day.  I have made many different pies that weren't the grand prize winner that we liked much better than this one.  Honestly, we were all disappointed by it."
6357,9996,2001-07-06,0,"Methi is very good for health and curd has a cooling effect on the body.
This roti is enjoyed in India generally in the winter months."
343980,46721,2007-01-28,5,As smiple as it sounds its by far one of the best meatloafs I have ate. I made a pan of cornbread to go with it its great. However my family like onions we did not think that one onion was enough so we added extra. Also I added one extra can of tomato sauce . I use two 8 oz. cans of hunts roasted garlic tomatoe sauce because my family also likes garlic it taste great.
1457659,193653,2010-09-25,5,"Very tasty.  Pine nuts being somewhat expensive, I'll probably use almonds when making larger batches.  I'll run the pine nuts (when used) through a quick chop in the food processor to get them to ""stick"" more to the broccoli as opposed to chasing them around on the plate.  All in all though both thumbs up on this one."
1964674,134437,2015-02-08,3,"I decreased the cayenne by half because I was worried it would be too spicy for a 3 and 7 year old, but I think they could have tolerated more. I also used milk instead of water for liquid which I think works better. Overall, it was a good recipe that I would probably make again, but I don&#039;t think it tastes too much like Wendy&#039;s as I don&#039;t taste hot sauce in their recipe. Also, I had no trouble getting my coating to adhere to the chicken."
308434,416187,2010-06-24,5,We really enjoyed this!  I did add garlic and a wee bit of tomato paste with herbs as I didn't have quite enough of the sun dried tomatoes.  I soaked/cooked the garbanzo's and used crimini mushrooms for the button.  I am looking forward to trying this as a burger. I made a Piquant Sauce to go with it. We will definately be making this again and again.  Thank you so much for sharing this lovely recipe.
53959,211779,2007-02-22,5,This was really good and very pretty. The yogurt was a perfect touch... not overly sweet.
37449,324526,2008-11-23,4,"I enjoyed this salad and liked the roasted cashews in the dressing. I felt the dressing could have used a little more seasoning- I added more lemon and a touch of sugar, but felt it still needed a little something more, but couldn't figure out just what. Thanks Mike for an idea I will use again, putting roasted nuts in the dressing!"
27783,63340,2003-06-03,5,"Excellent!  The flavor and texture of these eggs was perfect.  Note: the recipe doesn't currently mention when to add the cream, salt & pepper - I added these when mixing up the eggs."
869184,398832,2010-03-20,5,"I made this with pork tenderloin which worked out well. Next time I would double the sauce part. I was in doubt whether to add the salsa to the noodle mix or to serve it on the serve, and I opted to serve on the side, which I think was the right choice. The flavours were great together and liked by both adults and kids. Especially the coriander salsa stood out. You can always spice it up with some hot sauce if you wish. Made for Everyday is a holiday."
1801705745,32204,2014-04-16,5,This is the best brownie recipie have another pan in the oven right now! No more boxed mix 4 me.. If you are a baker like me u usually have these few ingredients on hand &amp; they always turn out no second guessing they&#039;re perfect every time! Thanks for the great recipie!
422893,250282,2008-02-22,4,This one was quite interesting not like anything I've had before. An unusual combo but I loved it nevertheless. Thanks Boomie!
376098,176182,2009-05-22,5,"This was a delicious recipe!  I marinated the chicken for about 5 hours, then used the oven baked option.  Everyone devoured their portion.  Thanks so much for posting!"
39301,293971,2008-04-23,4,Yum!  Fruit is my favorite dessert and this is a great way to enjoy it.  I've made this as written and also with a small container of strawberry-flavored Fiber One yogurt layered in (which I like even better). Great!  Thanks for posting.
72597,243142,2007-09-17,5,"Papa Gino's used to make these great cheese calzones--I was looking for a recipe that was similar, thankyou for this!! Yum!!"
160157,91598,2004-09-26,5,"This rice dish is fabulous!! Fast, Easy and Delicious! It will be made often at my house. It goes with just about anything. Thanks Cindy!"
145352,261422,2008-03-04,5,Fantastic Mama!!!!! The only change I did was to add some marinara sauce to the ricotta cheese. I also served them with more sauce for dipping. I love the crunchiness of the rolls (I used french bread rolls) and the cheesiness of the filling!!!! YUMMO!!!!
2512893,84078,2016-07-03,5,"Perfect recipe for Zucchini season! I made 2 loaves with intentions of freezing one or giving it away, but we ate both loaves. It's moist, chocolaty, and not too sweet. I didn't measure the chocolate chips I used, but it was probably more than the what was listed in the recipe. I will make this again and try to make muffins; maybe I can share those."
128473,279729,2012-06-05,5,"Thank you charlie #5 for sharing this lovely recipe.  I love Italian Sodas and this recipe is no exception.  What a great, refreshing, cold treat.  I used orange syrup and mixed it with 2 oz of cream.  It made a lovely soft subtle tasting orange treat that I will make again.  Made for My 3 chefs."
400708,117281,2007-07-22,5,"Thanks Kittencal, for a great recipe with clear directions and wonderful results.  I cannot believe I really made fresh home made hamburger buns.  They turned out great and from now on I'll be making my own, next time I'll try to shape them like hot dogs.  The crust was perfect with such a light fluffy center.  Ate one fresh from the oven and can't wait to serve these to the family.  I followed the recipe exactly, even holding back on the temptation to add more flour when I saw how sticky the dough was.  So glad I did as I'm sure that's what makes them so light and fluffy.  I didn't have sesame seeds to sprinkle on, but next time you can bet I'll make sure I do.  I wasn't sure about the right size of ball for the dough so tried a couple of differant sizes, but from now on I'll know just how to go with that.  I think the size of a baseball works for me.  Thanks again for a great recipe."
451060,70909,2008-02-16,5,"What a great idea! I modified this recipe by using plain non-fat yogurt and only three tablespoons (one serving) of demerara sugar, as I was out of brown. It was delicious, and I can't wait to try it with the blackberries that I have in the fridge!"
241241,22612,2010-01-24,4,Super easy to put together & makes alot! Great for our potluck dessert buffet party!
1735611,309754,2011-02-20,3,"Very nice texture and super fluffy but they have next to no flavor.  I used Grade B Amber syrup and even swapped the yogurt out for mixed flavors (mocha, marula and cinnamon) and can't imagine what it would taste with the regular light syrup you find and plain yogurt.  I would try them again but add much stronger flavors."
285039,124336,2008-03-09,4,"These were a wonderful side to the Prime Rib my neighbor made for dinner tonight.  I simmered them for around and hour and the mushrooms held their firmness, but were cooked tender.  I would have enjoyed a bit of thyme in the sauce, and think I will add about 1 t. of dried next time I prepare them.  Very tasty! Thanks for posting!"
2054493,149205,2011-11-05,5,I doubled the recipe and had a little trouble with it being cooked long enough.  You may need to use the cold water/softball technique to be certain.
402279,73194,2007-02-17,5,"Had four bunches of celery in the fridge so decided I needed to make soup to get rid of it. Wow, made this with some customizations and it was wonderful! Yes, the dijon mustard certainly does add a nice flavour. I made a double batch and used soy milk instead of skim milk (for non-dairy), leeks instead of onions, and oragnic chicken broth. It was fab, the whole family enjoyed it. I'll be making this one again and again. Thanks for the great recipe., qiltkitty!"
283251,141880,2006-12-24,5,"Yummy yummy! I used fresh mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe. So good! This freezes and reheats well too. :)"
246844,50315,2006-12-04,5,"This was fantastic!  This will replace my old recipe, for sure.  The couscous really makes this special.  I cut the cayenne in half for my daughter's sake and left out the hot sauce and it was perfect for her...only slightly spicy.  The flavors were sooo good.  Thanks for posting."
182268,28077,2006-06-21,5,Heaven is an understatement. Santa likes them too :D
195796,132432,2008-12-02,5,"Great recipe!  This was very easy to make and makes very delicious nuts.  I used meringue powder instead of actual egg whites, which calls for 2 tsp of powder + 2 tbsp of water to recreate 1 egg white.  Next time I will sub all the water with orange juice to increase the orange flavor."
1405736,60056,2011-08-11,0,"Very good recipe!!! I have made this twice this week, once with bratwurst and once with chorizo; both are tasty and delicious. I also added some corn on the cob to the chorizo and it fit in perfectly. Thanks for a delicious meal that I'm adding to my regular rotation."
291226,153827,2009-10-24,5,Easy and great fast recipe. I used mild Italian sausage and Hungarian sweet paprika. I omitted the mushrooms. Served with Asiago Cheese Bread and it was a hit with the family.
2001836212,73939,2017-12-03,0,"I've been making this for years using my own sauce recipe. My grandson loves it but my wife says I always make too much. One slight tweak I use, I got it form watching the Sopranos and heard Uncle Junior mention it. I add fresh basil leaves between the cheeses in the middle layer."
323186,90949,2011-10-21,4,"Easy and pleasant, I did find it maybe a little stodgy,  but I think the addition of cubed chicken, some onions,  or similar would just lift this to a full meal, it was nice and I might well make it again.  Thanks John, made for PAC Fall 2011"
148226,139909,2005-10-13,5,what more can I say than delicious!
427101,162779,2007-05-11,5,Yummy! Yummy! Yummy!  This was so good.  I will definatly make this again!  I made it for guests and everyone loved it.  Thanks for posting - made for PAC Spring 2007
471863,96475,2008-01-07,5,"WOW! Fabulous recipe!
I have tried about 10 different times to make my own burger buns (as I make all our bread). All 10 times I have failed! DH was getting frustrated but 'let' me try just one more time ;)
I see your recipe and tell DH well if 79 other people made it and loved it, how bad can I screw it up?!

I did not use a bread machine, just mixed the dough in my stand mixer.
However, I flattened them out to the thickness of a pancake and they did not rise nearly enough. Maybe I make thinner pancakes?!
So i re-kneaded it all and flattened them out to about 3/4 of an inch thick. PERFECT!!
I will always use your recipe!
Thanks for letting me save face for DH!"
89435,62761,2004-03-10,5,i worked in the kitchen of the ywam base in newcastle australia. i made this for 100 people and none was left! it is so amazing. we didnt have vanilla or cocoa so this dessert was perfect. it was even a bit undercooked and everyone loved it. thanks for making my day!
6357,67812,2003-07-30,4,This is a nice drink. I did add 3 tsps. of sugar to my cup of Klah  and I used 4 tsps. of the mix for my drink. It was thick and indulgent! Thank you for the recipe!!
1350389,186745,2009-11-25,1,I used cream cheese instead of mayo - everything else the same. I found it blah.  Would not make again.
4740,37336,2007-12-12,4,Very flavorful and easy.
21752,81334,2004-04-29,5,"Last night it was just me and my youngest Dornette at home, and when I asked her what she wanted for dinner she answered, ""Dessert!""  Did a quick search on Zaar for something fruity and reasonably healthy and found this recipe.  I made a full fat version with regular cream cheese and sour cream and served this on toast.  Heaven, simply heaven!  The two of us watched Pirates of the Caribbean for about the 45th time munching on our dinner.  I've got a bookclub meeting at my house next week, guess what's on the menu!"
1769963,96514,2015-01-08,5,My 13 year old daughter made these to contribute to Christmas dinner and they were fantastic!  Can&#039;t wait for her to make them again!

383346,87512,2010-12-30,4,Great drink.  Next time I will omit the lime juice cause it was a bit too tart.  Thanks Nat :)  Made for Let's Party event
1316248,31163,2009-07-06,0,"My parents made the best green beans in the world, but they are not longer here, and I can't duplicate them. I picked beans out of my garden and followed the recipe.

247927,32317,2006-09-23,5,"Oh girl!!!!   This is fabulous!  I am slow in responding with a review, but made this at Thanksgiving dinner 06.  My dad who has a response of ""Pretty good"", said great!  Which is a ""you have no idea"" response for him. Salad hasn't a right to taste this good.  ha ha.....will make again and again.  You're a gem for putting this recipe out there for all of us....thank you and keep sharing. Happy Cooking!

2449046,384700,2015-08-14,3,"I&#039;m giving this three stars, because although I didn&#039;t care for this, my son and neighbor both loved it.  There were several issues that I had with it.  First, it was a lot of work.  Lots and lots of chopping.  It took forever to finally get everything into the pot.  Second, it was very soupy.  Way too much liquid.  Third, even though I cut the jalope&ntilde;o, cayenne, and crushed red pepper down each by half, it was way too spicy.  And I like spicy.  And fourth, the cilantro was overpowering.  I like cilantro in small amounts.  I would have to cut the cilantro in half if I would ever make it again.  Which I guess I wouldn&#039;t have to worry about, because I didn&#039;t like it that much, and it was way too much work to ever make again."
209441,71245,2005-10-28,5,"Really good soup Kitty, rich and cheesy. I did add in bacon. We loved this. Thank you."
122087,79275,2009-03-29,5,"Used veggie broth and a little extra lemon juice instead of white wine and still turned out great! LOVE the sauce drizzled on top of white rice and steamed green beans. Next time I'll try putting asparagus directly in the pan with the fish - for a baked, buttery side dish."
798079,470498,2012-05-24,5,"Bang Bang Shrimp is one of my favorite foods! I've made this recipe on many occasions, always deep frying it, and we never have any leftovers.. It's that good :)"
4470,238,2009-06-30,5,Lovely peppy spices than enhance the flavor of the livers.  I was generous with the peri-peri because I love spice.  I added some mushrooms to the onions - Dinner was enjoyed by all
1453153,17126,2010-02-10,5,"Great simple recipe!  I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I used a can of diced and it was perfect.  I didn't edit the chili powder or cumin and did not think it was spicy at all."
1361992,291004,2009-09-06,5,This is one dessert that I love to make and eat anytime!  I love it topped with whipped cream but it's even better with French vanilla ice cream!
355944,74982,2006-10-08,5,"This was fantastic. I've always only had candied yams for Thanksgiving, but I found this dish much more fresh and light tasting, while still being creamy. Also easy to make. A keeper!"
1350389,77009,2010-04-02,3,Read the reviews on the thinness to cut the slices.  Paper thin turned out great - slightly bigger not so good.  Very time consumming for not much result in the end.
163872,66969,2005-01-03,5,"I took this to a party at a friend's down the street for New Year's Eve to serve as appetizers and it went over very well!  I doubled the recipe as I knew there would be a number of guests, but based on previous reviewers comments I started out with 1/4 c sugar, then tasted, then added another 1/4 c sugar, basically making the recipe with about half the amount called for.  Any kind of cooking with tequila is a wonderful thing!"
2000555343,353859,2015-10-12,5,"This is the best tofu recipe I&#039;ve tried so far! The whole family likes it! I doubled the sauce because the tofu I buy comes in a slightly bigger package and I just like to cook it all at once. I made it just for myself once and had  leftovers for the next day, and I must say, it was even better the next day! This recipe is a keeper! I serve it over rice with stir fry veggies on the side. Love it! Thank you for sharing the recipe!"
25356,10949,2002-04-13,5,"Wow! This was the best. I also used taco seasoning on the meat and threw in some black olives. After baking I topped it with sour cream, fresh tomatoes, a little lettuce and some tortilla chips. We kind of mixed it all together and it made an awesome taco salad sort of thing. Dh is so picky about what he eats and he gushed over this one. Quick, easy and really very inexpensive to make. Thanks!"
513366,37297,2008-06-30,3,"Although a good idea - I agreed with others as not much flavor, I was glad my breakfast guests canceled. My BF ate it because he doesn't like anything to go to waste.  I thought it was kind of mushy and overcooked."

262272,410023,2011-03-14,5,"I haven't had tuna noodle casserole in 30 years.  My mom finally stopped making it because we just wouldn't eat it.  I saw this and decided that it was time to be a big girl and try it again.  I made half a recipe because I wasn't sure how it would go over with my family.  I used albacore tuna and I used 4 one cup ramekins to serve it in.  I figured that maybe I could dazzle with presentation.  DH and I enjoyed it very much.  The kids don't like their food touching so I had little hope for them.  Unfortunately I ran out of time and my toaster oven just didn't want to broil the tops.  No matter, it was still good.  I really think this would be good without tuna and or vegetables or good with chicken and broccoli.  I plan on making this again in different ways.  Made for Spring PAC 2011."
844554,196186,2009-10-02,5,"Ohhh boy!!! Was this ever tender, moist and tasty. You could cut the chicken with your fork --didn't even need a knife. I also couldn't find roasted garlic broth, so added some chopped garlic to the onion sauteeing and used seasoning salt. I cut down on the butter and it was still S-O-O-O good!! Will make again for sure. Made for Fall PAC 2009 and very glad I did!!"
503916,2496,2008-03-29,5,"yummy! thanks for a lovely birthday cake for my friend. used 3/4 cup boiling water, and it was lovely, moist and chocolate-y. =)"
674022,145064,2014-11-28,5,"Absolutely terrific. We halfed the recipe as we only had that amount of turkey drippings but it was fab. Smooth, creamy, tasty gravy. The roux and the whisking makes it great.  We used recipe #77861 for roast turkey and the drippings from that flavored the gravy nicely. Everyone loved it. It was poured on everything. Of course it was gone in a flash. Will be the go to gravy recipe from now on. Thanks for posting Kittencal. Enjoy! ChefDLH"

1209242,106054,2013-09-20,5,"I was looking for a gluten free option for topping no-bake pumpkin pudding.  I didn&#039;t have SC, so I substituted milk which is like traditional southern pralines.  I know the flavor is different than if I&#039;d used SC, but these were still very good, and topped my dessert wonderfully!"
383346,411815,2011-01-09,5,"I used unsalted butter.  It's a great recipe to do for a small dessert.  It was eaten by me, DS and DH.  So yummy.  Thanks Greeny :)  Made for cookbook tag game"

57042,29636,2007-06-27,3,"I gave this 3 stars. I liked this coffee. I'm not sure what Dunkin Donuts plain iced coffee taste like as I've never had a plain iced coffee but this was good. I get iced coffee's with caramel or chocolate syrup from Dunkin Donuts. When I purchased the fresh ground coffee from Dunkin Donuts I asked the lady how to make it taste like the hot coffee they serve. She said to use cream in the coffee instead of milk so I used light cream. To me it tasted just like Dunkin Donuts coffee but much cheapier even with their bags of coffee. I made this recipe of my iced coffee with what I had on hand cooled half caff. coffee, fat free milk, and splenda. I added 2 tsp smuckers caramel to the bottom of my glass after trying this first as I wanted some flavor. Overall this is good and I will make it again as I do enjoy iced coffee. Thanks for posting. Christine (internetnut)"
442988,61911,2007-05-27,5,"Good, basic, very yummy zucchini recipe.  Prior to finding this, I'd sauteed zucchini and onion; now I can spritz it with olive oil spray (instead of using 2 Tbsp. of oil) and bake it, saving a lot of fat calories and getting a lot of flavor.  Thanks!"
308434,434407,2010-09-23,5,"Wonderful!!!!  It was hard waiting for the 2 weeks but well worth it.  Served this to guests who raved about it.  I took your advice and served with toasted french baguette and chopped tomatoes. Great to have on hand!  Thank you for sharing, Pink!  Made for KK`s Greek Forum."
799994,290314,2008-03-24,5,"Hi, I made these biscuits some days back, and they got over like hot cakes.  They are just wonderful and a simple and easy receipte too for the kids hungry tummies.  My hubby and kids want me to make them again so trying out a bigger quantity today.  Thanks for this receipe.  Simply fab !."
540346,77585,2013-03-07,5,This soup is delicious and easy to make.  I made a few changes because I didn't have some of the ingredients--such as subbing okra for green beans--but I left it mostly the same.  I am looking forward to eating it for lunch tomorrow.
383346,278395,2013-09-23,5,"That&#039;s so easy to do, very fast.  I used diet sprite.  Me and my son liked this a lot.  Thanks bmcnichol :)  Made for PRMR tag game"
2000299169,417995,2015-06-27,5,This dish was amazing.  When I first saw the picture my mouth began to water and I knew I had to make it.  I didn&#039;t stick to the recipe 100%.  Instead of bacon bits I fried up fresh bacon and crumbled it into the mixture and used the bacon fat to add flavor.  Amazinggggggggggg!  My husband and I almost ate the entire pot in one day!!
1682818,178233,2010-09-12,0,Outback uses spicy Tasso ham for this recipe. I used to work there.
2002029920,96008,2018-03-04,5,Fabulous! I cut the oil back further and I'm pleased with this dish. Made the sauce to accompany. This is a keeper!
804550,297272,2013-03-11,5,Wow! I sprinkled this on toast and it was a perfect combo of ingredients. I plan on trying it on a sliced banana in milk. Made for Veg n Swap tag.
248023,57250,2008-01-02,4,I halved the recipe easily and baked it in a 9x9 in pan.  These are very dense and truly do taste like cookie dough!  My BF loved them... to me they were a little too rich ( if that's possible!) and left me craving a large glass of milk!!!  They baked up very high and were very moist and delicious...  Great recipe!!!
528137,6548,2007-10-31,5,"Absolutely best meatloaf recipe ever. Here's a small hint for a great sandwich the next day(s)   Grilled meatloaf sandwiches. Absolutely terrific, especially on a sturdy bread, like a pump/rye swirl, with mustard. OMG! Of course, I topped the mearloaf with a brown sugar, mustard and ketchup blend."
1900301,53914,2015-03-04,4,Substituted cod for tilapia.  Served with garlic bread and Recipe #125463 by Crabbycakes.
54678,53757,2003-04-02,4,Kids loved it. We used caramel and choc sauce. Thought it had a coffee flavor to the oreo base.
2001034112,14499,2017-01-08,0,Try it with 151 Bacardi. Rumforgetable!
978876,418914,2010-07-25,5,"In response to a direct question to Bergy, this is what I did for DH...Drizzled the bread with Olive Oil and baked til crispy on ALL sides but still slightly soft in the middle as is his preference.  Removed the bread from the oven and rubbed with a Garlic Clove.  Topped with Smoked Oysters, very thin sliced Red Onion, as much Jalapeno as would ""stay"" and a drizzle of Lemon Juice (Capers were ommitted).  DH raved over it!  Smoked Oysters is always his ""Treat"" when we go camping and something he enjoys around the campfire.  Looks like I'll have to start thinking more ""Gourmet"" next camping trip! :)  Thanks Bergy for a GREAT treat to serve my husband!!"
552613,254752,2008-05-27,5,"A very versatile veggie stirfry recipes where you could easily switch in and out with whatever vegetables you have on hand.  I used normal mushrooms, fresh baby corn rather than canned and green onions rather than white because that is what I had and it was a very tasty lunch.  Also, because I have to really watch my fat intake I used a splash of rice wine vinegar instead of the oil to 'fry' the veggies.  I also used splenda instead of actual sugar and it all worked and tasted great.  Made for Zaar World Tour 4."
64153,52386,2003-08-16,4,These were good.  I had pineapple/mango preserves which tasted great as well.  Simple recipe with great results.  Thanks for posting!
386585,476089,2012-03-18,5,"Well, this couldn't be simpler and it definitely tastes great.  Even though I'm not the biggest fan of limoncello, the sugar and orange juice really mellow it out.  I think this would go great on a dessert like cheesecake or sponge cake or even added to a fruit salad.  Thanks for sharing this just in time for strawberry season!"
38182,14363,2005-10-21,5,I didn't want to mess with chicken wings so I used chicken tenders. Great Taste and thickened sauce looks pretty too. You can use the sauce over leftover chicken also.
90148,95906,2007-12-06,2,"Not impressive.  Not aweful, just plain."
105601,111230,2010-05-04,5,"I was a little skeptical on this recipe, as the ingredients didn't sound right--pineapple juice and soy sauce for carnitas?  However, I tried it because I love Mean Chef's recipes.  I'm so glad I did!

One thing to note when you make this is that the marinade and fuego spice mix actually make WAY more than you need for the 3 lbs of pork.  Next time I make this, I plan to use 8-9 lbs of meat & triple the other ingredients in the FIRST section of the recipe so I don't waste anything (and have lots of yummy leftovers to freeze).  I also don't plan to coat the meat pieces with seasoning before I marinate.  I plan to add most of the spices (reserving some) to the  Aqua Negra marinade.  Coating them seemed like a waste of time since immediately you throw them in liquid.  I will use some of the reserved spices to throw in the oil when I fry the pork before cooking.

I HIGHLY recommend this recipe.  The layering of flavors is fabulous!"
360080,297290,2009-10-22,5,"This is great! Ham, mustard, and brown sugar just belong together. My dad always made a very tasty sauce for ham with plain yellow mustard and brown sugar, but the Dijon mustard, honey, and rosemary in this recipe really add something. We made this on the grill rather than under the broiler. A great easy meal for a busy weeknight! Thanks."
350938,425174,2010-06-09,5,This was so easy and so tasty. Made exactly as directed and was very pleased. Will make this again. Thanks for sharing this lovely recipe ;)
470351,28383,2008-07-28,0,"I won't give this any stars because I don't like peas but was hoping I would with this recipe.  That being said...the mixture of toasted almonds, onions, fresh mushrooms , butter and salt and pepper was wonderful!!  I think for someone who really likes peas, you'll enjoy this dish.  For those of you (like me!) that hate peas...it won't quite sell you.  Thanks for posting!"
424680,421079,2011-06-21,5,"I made these first of all as a lunch, & got adventurous, I thought, when I rolled a bit of shredded BBQ chicken inside & topped them with a homemade blueberry sauce! Later in the day, the two left over were spread with a bit of cream cheese, with the blueberry sauce used as a dip! Very, very nice, & we thoroughly enjoyed the combo of the oatmeal & the flour used! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Made & reviewed in Zaar Cookbook Tag]"
1802614020,107868,2014-03-24,5,"I actually made an account to review this! My bread machine instructions gave me horrible, stodgy bread and this one is so close to the shop-bought one in terms of texture but the flavour is much much better! I&#039;ve just made a chicken sandwich using it and oh sweet wow. To anybody in the UK I used 410g flour, 240ml water, 50ml of vegetable oil and a Sainsbury&#039;s dry yeast sachet."
92886,83235,2004-06-17,4,"I really liked this!  It was easy, fairly quick and original.  I used provolone because I had it on hand, but I otherwise followed the recipe fairly closely."
73836,56626,2003-09-15,5,"Made this for dinner tonight and the flavour was superb.  I added chunks of swede (turnip to you Americans)because my DH and I both love it and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. Cheap, easy and delish!! I will definitly be making this again and again. Thanks for the recipe!!"
1289714,252161,2010-06-30,5,good
606419,50676,2010-04-26,5,These were delicious! I used canned chicken and mixed the corn & black beans with the chicken mixture. They were quick and easy a great weeknight meal. Thanks!
166642,315653,2008-09-27,5,This is a wonderful drink! Love the flavors blended together. Very refreshing. Thanks for posting.
461834,276875,2010-01-13,5,"Wonderful fruity punch and very easy to make!!  I also scaled this back to 1 1/2 servings and enjoyed it with my breakfast today.  It is the beginning of our strawberry season, so I subbed fresh strawberries, added a little bit of sugar and then pureed.  I used Sprite Zero for the lemon-lime soda.  Thanks for sharing another great recipe.  Made for Gimme 5 Tag."
406667,26723,2008-04-22,5,Made this for the family and my DS's 8 and 7  went gaagaa!  The loved it and want me to make it all the time  Since there was no amount for the nacho chips and sour cream I added a bunch and it was very filling :)  thanks so much for sharing
651609,84764,2009-09-16,5,"What a pretty dish! I made this last  night to take to a potluck at church tonight. DH tried it for me (as I dont care of Mac salad personally, but he loves it) and he thought it was really good! Easy to make, smells great! Makes a large amount. I am sure everyone at church will love it as well!"
94243,210634,2007-02-22,4,"Hmmm... Mine didn't really look anything like the picture and it definetly wasn't creamy.  I am guessing by looking at the picture that you are supposed to mix the whipped topping in with the cream cheese, pudding mix and sweetened condensed milk.  But I followed the dirctions and spread the mixture (minus the Cool Whip) on the pie crust and it was really hard to spread.  I put the Cool Whip on top.  The flavor was really good.  It was reeeeally rich, but very tasty.  My husband helped himself to three pieces after dinner last night.  I'll definitely be making this again, but next time the Cool Whip's going in with the rest of the ingredients.  ; )  Thanks, Angie!

755268,209259,2009-02-15,5,George was my boss and a great chili cook. Maud and George both where World Champions. I have had this chili. none better.
95743,48475,2004-10-30,5,This is an excellent soup.I made no changes other than skipping the butter and adding Italian turkey sausage to Dh's portion.  I recommend using a good homemade broth.
164610,18162,2007-05-27,0,"Just a hint to all of you; I found that Jimmy Dean makes a mild pork sausage that is 50% less fat than other brands.  This is great news, because the sausage is delicious, but if you need lots of pan drippings to make sausage gravy, you should prob pick the full-fat pork sausage.  In my recent experience, I got less than 1 tsp of pan drippings from 1lb of the Jimmy Dean 50% less fat.  I'm not rating this recipe, because I didn't use it to make my gravy and biscuits, but since it calls for Jimmy Dean brand, I thought I'd share my recent experience. :)"
2001486332,8334,2017-04-13,0,"I have made this several times and it is everyone's favorite - friends even named it Frank the Flank - it is a great, simple recipe! You should certainly give it a try! You won't be sorry!"
1993358,382108,2011-08-28,5,"Fabulous! Had fresh zucchini, tomatoes and corn on hand, and browsed for a good recipe. Tried this one, and loved it. Delicious. Definitely a keeper!"
232047,60119,2006-07-26,4,"I had trouble getting the right temerpature without having a deep fry thermometer.  So my cooking times were a bit longer.  However the fries still tasted good.  But they only stayed crunchy for a few minutes after cooking.  To add extra zest I coated the fries with dry Italian dressing mix by placing a SMALL amount in a paper bag, adding fries then shaking.  We didn't even need ketchup."
141293,164153,2007-04-28,5,"These cookies were wonderful, but I only got 27 cookies - I must have made them too big.  That's okay - they were still delicious!  I used walnut oil, and super chunky peanut butter.  OOPS, I just re-read the recipe, and I didn't add butter!?!?!  They still worked tho."
337963,253289,2008-02-11,4,"loved it!  hubby made this for me last night and it really hit the spot.  a very pretty drink too.  i had him add 1 more oz OJ so it wasn't quite as strong.  thank you Amanda.  made for bevy tag, please see mt rating system."
280605,219899,2008-02-05,5,"Very nice!  I didn't have frozen peas, so left them out.  Outstanding recipe. I added a bit too much cayenne for my liking, but the rest of the family really enjoyed this!"
278118,334220,2010-10-02,4,"I really liked the flavors of this recipe - the rest of the family - not so much.  It is a wonderful way to use those really big zucchinis though!  I didn't puree the soup - just partially mashed with a potato masher.  I like the ""chunks"" better myself. I also threw in some diced carrots for color.  A very pretty presentation.  I will post pics later.  Made for the September 2010 Aussie/NZ recipe swap."
779318,66121,2009-10-12,5,"This was awesome. 
I only used 1/2 cup brown sugar.
This is a keepeer.
Thanks for posting."
452881,284465,2008-03-01,1,"not at all like a Lofthouse cookie.  They came out still raw in the middle even after baking for 9 minutes. The search for a Lofthose cookie recipe continues. By the way, I used a cookie scoop and got 18 cookies from one batch."
2216316,24943,2012-11-21,4,This recipe is fantastic. Made it tonight. Added 1/4 tsp allspice and 2 Tbls fresh dill. DELISCIOUS!!!
50778,398664,2011-09-19,3,"Good basic recipe.  I used dried out hot dog buns for the bread because that's what I had and I changed out 1 c. of the milk for buttermilk (again, it's what I had).  Had to stir up the mixture very gently as hot dog buns (even those toasted and dried out in the oven) are pretty delicate.  Folded in chopped, frozen cranberry's and poured the whole mess into a 12"" round baker and sprinkled the top with raw sugar.  I baked it at the specified temp though it required a bit more time.  Pulled it out when it was puffed and golden.  It looked beautiful!  The tangy punch of the cranberry was excellent and I think next time I'll add a bit of cinnamon.  <br/><br/>The only issue I have with this recipe is the sauce.  I think the butter ratio is too high.  Next time I'd cut the butter by half or use a different recipe entirely."
667915,46780,2009-11-21,5,"Made this for dessert and it was wonderful!  After we all had a small piece, I sent the remainder home with my son for his family, thinking my husband and I didn't need to have it around to be tempted...and now I'm sorry I did.  It would have been worth the extra calories!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe...I'll make another for Thanksgiving, for sure!"
279218,109655,2006-06-28,5,"This was so easy to make and so tasty.  I used risotto rice since that was all I had but it worked great.  DH thought I'd bought them at Whole Foods, though for him they weren't spicy enough!  Thank you for sharing this one."
47892,504868,2013-08-04,5,"Went to grab the bottle of coconut extract and the liquid had evaporated! What to do?! I know!&lt;br/&gt;Add equivalent amount of spiced rum! Yay! So yummy, creamy and easy to make! I tried demerara sugar for standard sugar and garnished the top of the pudding with additional sprinkle of demerara.  Made for ZWT 9. Will post photo soon I hope!"
773508,67085,2010-09-08,5,"I loved this recipe!  I use the breast meat from a rotisserie chicken, and have used different mixes/types of cheese.  Even better the next day!"
527607,189321,2007-10-04,5,"This was wonderful.  I forgot to review it the night i made it, and of course by the next night all leftovers were gone so i couldn't even take a pic.

I put some left over seasoned taco meat on top of the chilis and some corn, then the cheese. Its a very versatile recipe"
166642,155116,2008-09-13,5,Excellent recipe! We really enjoyed this as a side dish. It can be addicting. Thanks for sharing. Made for the Magic Mushroom Tag Game in the Asian Cooking Forum.
53932,77935,2006-03-08,5,Excellent and so easy to make.  I didn't marinate for the full amount of time and the shrimp were still wonderfully flavored.
311258,108068,2006-04-25,5,Thanks for this recipe.. the folks at our local community center really loved it. It turned out just perfect! Thank You
611548,28535,2011-05-05,4,"My hubby loved it and plans on putting the leftovers in his coffee tomorrow morning.  I loved the flavor, but the texture was a little bit to be desired.  I used raw milk cream skimmed, so that may be why.  It just seemed to separate and be a bit too liquidy.  My kids seemed a little undecided on the flavor - probably the liqueur.  However, I think this would make an excellent ice cream recipe in the ice cream machine and plan to try it."
107583,461076,2011-08-15,4,"These are very easy to make and taste wonderful. I did have a problem with them being too soft/moist in the center for using on a bun. I would add more bread/cracker crumbs and maybe salt the zucchini and let it drain and then squeeze out the excess moisture first before cooking. But if you are just going to eat them as a patty without the bun, they are fine. The sauce is just the right compliment for these. I used parsley and fresh oregano, and think they would be good with fresh cilantro also!"
1901638,124968,2011-05-04,2,"I taste tested before I put it on the rolls and it didn't taste like Texas Roadhouse (not that it was bad, but I just really wanted the real thing) so then I remembered that it kind of had a honey taste and added about 1/4 cup of honey. You have to whip it real good, but it made all the difference! I've also found that you don't have to use condensed milk and instead just use the corn syrup, some brown sugar and white sugar. :)"
1411633,20617,2014-08-03,5,Everyone in my family loves this one!
168149,23874,2004-11-02,5,This is a GREAT appitizer. It's not to heavy nor is it too spicy. I've made this on several occasions. Easy to make and everyone loves it. I origionally found it in Bon Appetit September 1998. Thanks for reminding of it. I was looking for something easy to make for a party this weekend.
1060667,265958,2016-10-26,5,"I have never made fish stew before, so I was very skeptical. It turned out WONDERFUL!! I thought the coconut milk would not work for us, it's a lot and without any broth, I thought my family would not like it, but it worked great and everyone loved it, even my 6 yr. old :) I did overcook my fish, but that was my fault. Served with a homemade crusty French bread and my husband ate his over rice as well. Thanks for a fantastic first fish stew experience!!"
567976,607,2007-09-25,5,"Having gone to graduate school in St. Louis (go Cardinals!!!), I had to try this one.  It is so good and we had alot left over.  Toasted french bread with swiss cheese melted on it tops it off great.  Thanks Brother!!"
29782,28741,2007-01-22,5,"This was fantastic!! As other reviewers have mentioned. Its a great non tomato based recipe and we will have this recipe more often. Next time or in the near future, I will use this when grilling chicken on the grill. I could just imagine how delicious it would be. Thanks so much for sharing a family favorite :)"
997403,18693,2009-09-06,5,What a delicious cake!  This is super moist even using the 1 tbsp oil/1/2 cup applesauce substitution.  I kept the rest the same.  I hope my neighbors like it at our Block Party today!
509989,159877,2007-07-05,5,I love this recipe.  It took me a long time to figure this out.  I thought there would be more to it.  If you like honey mustard this is the easiest recipe ever.
143721,384360,2012-07-22,4,"This is a great little recipe.  Great flavor but (and this is why I'm only giving it a 4 rating) when the directions stated to ""place mushrooms on the grill and fill each with the egg)  some of the egg pours through the mushrooms.  Some egg does remain, but next time, and I will make this again, I will but foil on the grill first.  Made for ZWT8 and The Wild Bunch."
283390,14593,2008-01-02,5,"Awesome cookies! I made my cookies a little larger than called for, I think, because I only got 4 dozen and they took 12 minutes to bake. I loved the orange rind, coconut, and cranberry combo. I'll definitely be making these again!"
161897,227176,2008-03-04,5,"I tried this tonight, following the recipe exactly.  It turned out great and everyone loved it.  Next time, I plan to intensify the flavors by adding more garlic, lemon and parsley.  I also like the other reviewers' suggestions of grape tomatoes, green onions and/or capers.  However you do it, it makes a super side dish.  Thanks for posting it!"
437679,257728,2009-09-12,5,"I'm trying to make friends with oatmeal, as it makes a healthy and filling breakfast, but I still have a lot of bad memories of the flavourless porridge I ate at Guide camp.  I enjoyed this because there's almost more apple than oatmeal.  :)  This and a cup of coffee should help me get the day started!"
204024,331188,2012-08-19,5,"Easy, quick, and good!  Bypasses a lot of the kneading and shaping steps; the sticky dough is a little tricky to measure, but rises into the pan. I think this chef's muffin pans are larger than mine; I got fifteen nice-sized rolls. I probably underbaked mine, but they're perfect inside.  Made for ZWT8."
296027,304969,2008-06-17,5,My DD helped make these and they were the hit of the night in our Greek themed dinner!  Will make them again!  **Made for ZWT4**
514499,180803,2009-09-27,5,"Mmmm! I loved that this recipe only has a few ingredients, yet it produced a very tasty dip. I used fresh spinach, chopped, and then sauteed in a bit of oil instead of the frozen 'cause that is what I had on hand. Great simple recipe and I will definitely make this again!"
1677099,85929,2012-10-04,5,"I used pasta shells and fresh broccoli.  1/2 full cream and 1/2 2% milk.  Next time more cream.  I like the freshness of the broccoli, it still has a bit of crunch this way.  It does need a punch.  I got this with salt and pepper, preserving the taste of the fresh broccoli.  This could be a great side or main dish."
844554,109996,2010-03-30,5,This was easy and good. Mine turned out a little drier than I would have liked. The noodles were also a little overcooked at 60 minutes. Be sure and check before then. I added chopped up celery also. Made for I Recommend Tag Game 2010.
479014,135350,2009-02-07,5,Prep was easy.  The taste before baking was good. Smelled wonderful while cooking and tasted just like I remember my Grandma's tasting.  I added a bit of garlic powder and some crushed red pepper to taste and our family is hooked. Thanks for this delicious recipe.
1512930,174634,2011-02-26,5,"I made a few substitutions and they still turned out really well.<br/><br/>Instead of butter I used extra virgin coconut oil.<br/><br/>Instead of brown sugar, I used about 1/3 cup coconut sugar and 1/3 cup honey. (They could have been a tiny bit sweeter though.)<br/><br/>Instead of flour and melted chocolate, I used just under 1/2 cup cocoa powder and filled the rest of the measuring cup up to 3/4 with ground almonds.<br/><br/>I added a handful of crushed walnuts and chocolate chips.<br/><br/>I baked them in a pan slightly larger than what the recipe specified, but they were so light and fluffy that they came out perfectly anyhow. I think they only took about 25 minutes at 350.<br/><br/>Thank you for this wonderful recipe, I will definitely make it again!"
847676,295877,2010-02-06,4,"This was a great recipe and simple. Wussies! The heat was just right, even bumped it up. Added a little bit of minced garlic, onion and fresh parsley.  Next time I will wait a few minutes before adding the red bell pepper to the kielbasa it cooked too long and was a bit soggy."
137911,218854,2007-05-11,5,Delicious!  I used lean ground beef and tomatoes in my salad. I liked the addition of the lime juice with the vinaigrette dressing.  I also used some salsa and sour cream on top and added some fresh cilantro.  I like this version of taco salad better than the catalina one.
893773,283271,2010-10-24,5,"My husband loved this.  I think he ate 5 bowls.  Next time I will add a little cayenne or chili powder, just to add a little more flavor.  Also, I didn't have any bacon, so I fried a little ham and threw it in.  The flavor was great."
197023,301400,2008-10-08,5,"A very quick to prepare mid-week recipe and really healthy (lots of vegetables!) and flavoursome. What more can one ask for?  Apart from adding two leeks, I made this exactly to the recipe.  I used lemon juice rather than the other option of rice vinegar.  I blended about three quarters of the soup so there were still some chunky bits in it.  I removed a quarter of the soup, used the immersion blender, then added the quarter portion back into the pot.  A great blend of flavours, Boomette, and a recipe I'll certainly make again.  Thank you for sharing it."
116856,18422,2005-09-12,5,These burritos taste just like the ones I buy at M&M meat shop. 
2001729974,114392,2017-11-21,5,This recipe was crazy good! After reading all the reviews I decided to make a double batch because I was pretty sure I was going to love it - and I did. The only &quot;tweak&quot; I made was to grind up the fennel. I'll be using this for year - thank you for sharing it!!
64667,343192,2009-05-18,5,"Okay, I must confess to total gnomish stupidity...as I ""thought"" I had chickpeas and was well into the making of the olives before I realized the last can had been--ach, what is this?--consumed!   So, having morels on hand instead, that is what I made...and we enjoyed them just as well (or even better).   So...my review is limited in scope to the OLIVES....and may I add here, that I LOVE olives, so this recipe could only be GOOD!   I believe I will begin using this recipe for future holiday buffets, as it is so clever and works perfectly with this little (lovely, and un-gnomishly beautiful) three-part dish from MIL.   My DH who rarely comments on his food thought these olives were very good!  That is high compliment from him--believe me!   *ZWT 5  Spanish region  Kid Friendly Challenge*"
1419094,308793,2009-10-19,4,"Its an easy recipe to follow, visually appealing and with the addition of some cheese on top and garlic bread and salad; makes a very filling meal. Nothing really pops out about the recipe on the palate, but I think some tweaking of the red sauce might bring back some of the lasagna taste."
591307,102237,2008-06-21,5,Had these delicious veggies along with Recipe #254778 and Recipe #8753 out on the grill.  I marinated them for about 8 hrs. and the results were great! We will have these again when we are grilling out most definately.
157425,99430,2008-06-05,5,"I love yukon gold potatoes whem making mashed and these were great! Perfect amount of garlic for us and who wouldnt love cream cheese, sour cream, and butter. Love the tanginess and will definitely be making these again. Made and reviewed for ZWT 4."
377499,223501,2009-01-24,5,We added 1/8 tsp almond extract and frosted on vanilla cupcakes. Not very healthy but delicious. This is almost effortless. We will be making again.
1015724,35659,2008-11-05,5,"This was excellent and very easy to put together!

I do admit that I changed a few things (I substituted 3 tbs of unsweetened cocoa powder for the dark chocolate, and added apx. 1 cup natural peanut butter right after the cocoa in Step 10), but this was an excellent base recipe!  

This one goes in my monthly dinner rotation.  Thanks ciao!"
56680,102593,2005-09-17,5,"I lOVE THIS!!!!  I had to do a few subs.  My small town does not carry ham stock, so I cooked the onion in the bacon grease to get that flavor.  I used 6 cups of chicken stock (the big can) and it was thick and yummy.  Tastes just like baked potatoes, its amazing!  Used the food processor for the taters and onions, actually cooked the taters 2 days before, put them in skins and all.  I put 6 of the bascon strip right into the soup and only saved 2 to garnish.  I am sending some home with my SIL who is pregnant as an easy meal for her so she can rest.  Thanks for a keeper, I will make this for the mill guys this winter.

110125,126900,2006-08-18,5,"Very good!  I was looking for a simple kidney bean recipe to stoke up on fiber and protein.  I wasn't sure I would like the rosemary, but I did.  Made the recipe exactly as stated and had it for lunch today with a piece of my whole grain zucchini bread (180765).  The red pepper flakes added just the right amount of heat (not too much)."
215260,58347,2006-04-18,5,This is the best chicken. My 3 year old picky eater eats 2nds of this. 10 stars! 
59686,248132,2011-04-12,0,"I've made this vinaigrette several times, but modifying the ingredients to my liking. I found 1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oil was more than enough. The 1st time I made this, I used 2 tablespoons, and the 2nd time I just used 1 tablespoon, which I thought was more than enough oil. I also used 2/3 cup (10 tablespoons) of raspberry vinegar, plus the 1/2 cup of sugar, 2 tsp of Dijon mustard, and 1/4 tsp each of the black pepper and dried oregano. With the adjustments to the ingredients I used, I found this made exactly 1 cup. This is a good home-made vinaigrette dressing, providing you don't add too much veg.oil, and too much dried oregano, as too much oregano can over power the taste of the dressing. With the modifications I made to the dressing, I found this to be a 5-star recipe. I made this dressing to serve with Marg (Cayman Designs) salad... Cranberry Pecan Salad With Feta Cheese. Just be sure to go easy when adding the dressing, as I found a little of this goes a long way, plus it's quite tart & tangy."
1699391,349259,2011-05-16,2,"Looks cute, tastes okay."
583193,164560,2014-12-01,5,"Yum!  Took it in the bath with me.  Used caramel ice cream, coffee, caramel sauce and amaretto.  Amazing!"
1386133,16576,2009-09-16,5,"This was the first recipe I made from this website, and I didn't change a thing other then I used Dijon Mustard instead, and it was delicious absolutely amazing will definitely be on my top ten favorites!!!"
360899,108825,2007-02-10,5,This is heavenly; we had it at a friend's house and I was very excited to find the recipe here. I wouldn't change a thing!
95241,87365,2004-04-08,0,"As a native New Orleanean, I make this dish all the time (as did those several generations before me).  My only suggestions would be to add 1 cup of chopped celery and substitute marjoram for the basil.   It truly makes our Mondays special around here."
107135,90042,2006-04-11,5, rich creamy dish very good thanks for posting . dee
1157776,13641,2009-02-04,5,"Made this version of Deviled Eggs, when I had to bring something for the Easter Service of my Parents Chruch. This were a huge hit, and out of 8 different deviled eggs provided mine were gone in a flash."
324840,27974,2009-07-12,5,"I made this on our sailing trip for 7, and everyone raved about it! I love how it doesn't need eggs, and still tastes just as good! The only thing I want to correct is that it serves 4, not 6-8, we only had 1 scoop each and didn't feel like we ate anything!"
339260,28094,2011-05-31,5,"I love, love, loved this recipe.  I've been trying a lot of new recipes since finding out I have Type 2 diabetes.  This recipe is one of my favorite new recipes.  The eggplant had so much flavor.  I served it with Dreamfields spaghetti which is better for people that are watching their carbs.  This one is going straight into my keeper file.  Thanks for an absolutely delicious recipe, Sue Lau.  Made for Diabetic Cooking Tag Game."
1990855,66703,2013-02-06,5,Delicious!  Chewy center surrounded by a melt-in-your-mouth crust.  I used whole wheat flour and all natural peanut butter.
209743,155116,2008-02-07,5,Very popular with my mushroom loving husband. Don't forget the sesame oil though! It is that last crucial flavour component that makes the entire dish. Thanks for sharing!
424680,116367,2011-12-02,5,"Made two changes (if you want to call them that) ~ I cut the recipe in half for the 2 of us & then did not peel the potatoes since we like the flavor of the skins! Otherwise I followed the recipe & we were very pleased with the potatoes! Had a few pieces left over, as well, & they were great as a cold snack! Thanks for a great keeper, as I'll be making these 'tatoes again! [Made & reviewed in Zaar Stars recipe tag]"
549893,64355,2009-04-24,5,This was a great cheesecake. I used a mix of sweet and tart apples for this and it came out awesome. It was a huge hit. I plan to make this again and again. Thanks so much for sharing!!
603831,15498,2007-12-08,5,very delicious.  i love vegetarian chili b/c it's so colorful & flavorful.  i did add a pound of beef to it.  wonderful!  i will definatley make it again esp for my super bowl party.
183565,109884,2005-11-14,5,Wow - this blueberry banana bread was awesome.  I used fresh ground soft white wheat flour (added 1/2 cup - 3 cups total) and 1/2 c sucanat in place of regular sugar. I left out the coconut - just a personal preference.  Then I made one loaf with pecans and one without - I have some family members that are not nut lovers.  Thanks Kelly for the frozen blueberry tip!  Very moist and not too sweet.  I will definitely be making this again.  
333329,123747,2006-08-10,4,"I doubled the recipe to make two pies for a potluck picnic. I used fresh peaches from a nearby orchard. The filling was delicious (very sweet) and I got many compliments, but the pies were messy and did not setup well. I think I should have used the entire box of Jell-o instead of only three tablespoons per pie. Next time, I will use this filling in a cobbler or maybe as a tart filling, which I think would be perfect."
57222,136781,2006-07-12,5,"Delicious scones! I had to add a tablespoon or so of water in order to get a smooth dough - quess my egg wasn't big enough! Also, self-raising flour is not available here, so I used 6 oz. all-purpose (about 1,5 cups) + 2 ts baking powder (plus the additional 1/4 ts called for in the ingredient list) + 3/4 ts salt as per substitution instructions. If you have to substitute, too, be warned: it's too much salt, I think 1/4 to 1/2 would be enough! I didn't roll out the dough but just formed six 2-inch high rounds by hand - just being lazy! Even with all these modifications, the scones turned out great! Thank you so much for the recipe!"
176615,23303,2006-06-04,5,"Great salad with an unusual and unexpected flavor from cardamon and grapefruit juice in the dressing. Thought about half the amount of dressing was more than enough. Didn't realize until later that it had no oil which is always a plus. Great recipe, Bergy. Thanks for sharing!"
278639,122028,2012-02-08,5,"I made a batch of these cookies to take to my neighbors.  They really liked them.  And so did I, as they were easy and turned out great!  Thanks for posting this!"
573639,30081,2008-10-02,5,"Really good recipe! Like other reviewers, I used minced garlic and added a bit of lemon juice. I also substituted chicken for the beef. I was able to use fat-free yogurt and got the same creamy effect. Tasted just like my favorite diner's gyros! My husband asked that this be added to our dinner rotation. Yum!"
280747,76930,2006-01-19,5,"Very good and oh so easy! I used whole wheat thin spaghetti to give it a boost nutrition wise. My grocery store has a ""rainbow slaw"" coarse grated cabbage, carrot and broccoli (near bagged salads)which I stirfried and tossed with some of the noodle dressing. It was a nice addition that added some crunch and color (wouldn't think of making without now). I served it all salad bar style with the scallions and sesame seeds on the side, as I have some picky eaters. Also marinated ""fake"" chicken strips with the marinade for my vegetarian son. Rave reviews from him, and my 5 yr old said ""I wish Mommie could make this every night!"" BTW - We all love the name!!"
433374,48635,2007-01-23,5,These turned out to be the best home made pancakes than I have ever made! I even made the heart one - my husband was so impressed! Thanks!!
552613,327455,2009-05-16,5,"For something so simple these fajitas were Muy bueno.  I marinated the meat whole for about 2 1/2 hours and it made the meat very tender indeed.  I am not sure that I really tasted that much of the beer in the cooked meat but I appreciated the tenderness. I also enjoyed that the lack of spicing meant that the actual ingredients were able to shine on their own.  Myself and my husband have different heat tolerance levels.  So, he put hot and spicy jalapenos on his and I put mild banana chillies. I served the steak in flour tortillas with salsa, sour cream and guacamole.  Thank you for a tasty meal.  Made for the Chow Hound team on ZWT 5."
58439,244410,2010-03-20,5,"This is AMZING, TRUE!
Served as a dip with water cracker dippers too!
Guests kept going mmmmmmmmmmmm and coming back for more,
Isn't that what a great entertaining recipe is for?
Thanks!
I did add more coconut milk through,
As made the day before for convenience too!
I also DOH added peanut oil instead of drizzling it in,
This recipe is definately a win!
Will be making it again this week, TRUE!
And hope to get the add oil drizzle right too!
DEFINATELY use peanut oil and makes for a great combination,
Made this recipe with alot of elation!
THANKS!"
213139,204106,2009-02-16,5,"Made for ""And the Secret Ingredient is..... Tag game""  Wonderful angel food cake.  I will be making this over and over again.  Thank you for posting this Tiger!"
98919,77397,2006-02-04,5,"My first impression of this recipe, reminded me of a wonderful childhood memory. When I tasted it warm out of the oven I thought of when my mom used to take the leftover scraps of dough from making a pie crust and bake it with cinnamon/sugar and butter.  My grandkids loved this and it is so easy to make.  Thanks for sharing Kittencal!"
67728,173146,2010-06-17,5,"What a refreshing snack or light dessert! I made only one orange's worth of this because I was the only one home. I used plain nonfat Greek yogurt sweetened with a little honey in place of the orange yogurt (didn't have any). Loved the cinnamon on this, too! Thanks for posting :)! Made for The Queens of Quisine for ZWT6 NA*ME"
89831,305880,2008-07-27,5,"these are great,  I only had 4 ripe bananas in my freezer so that is what I used,  I served them with homemade buttermilk syrup, thanks for sharing Syd!"
315565,418574,2011-10-04,5,"This was like a dense mud cake brownie, small serves only required but very delicious and moreish. I ran out of apricots so used tiny diced dried cranberries instead which worked really well. They were tiny bites of zing amidst the deep chocolate flavours."
2000306956,438624,2015-06-30,5,"About two years ago, my friend and I had some extra lemons and wanted to find a recipe that would use them up. We found this recipe, and it was a miracle. The taste: perfect. The texture: perfect. These. Cookies. Are. Perfect. It is a good thing that each batch makes so many cookies, because only about half of the dough ends up in the oven, if you know what I mean. My friends (vegan and non-vegan alike) beg for these cookies, and now I purposely go out to by lemons to make them; they are no longer for leftovers. I am about to make some more to send in a care package to my boyfriend -- lucky him! (hint: making smaller cookies will make them crispier, larger will be softer...I prefer soft cookies, but I always make some of each because they are great both ways)"
173579,75943,2008-11-07,5,Great recipe! It fluffed up so pretty and was soooo creamy.  Will be making this a lot.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.
572500,66703,2009-02-11,5,"Just as the title reads....""Big Grandma's Best"".  These are wonderful cookies and their unorthodox nature makes 'em all the better.  I didn't have Creamy Skippy so i used Super Chunk and got more of a mountain man type of texture.  Grand!"
51109,73844,2004-04-11,5,"I had a lot of difficulty rolling, cutting, and transferring these morsels, but am I ever glad I stuck with it!  They were terrific. After I mangled the first several, I decided to wrap the roll in saran and let it sit in the freezer for 20 mins. to firm up.  That worked well and the rest looked almost as pretty as the picture!  I will surely make these again, many times over.  Thanks for a real treat."
279989,209062,2008-06-09,4,This was a really good spread.  I cup the recipe down and my kids and I spread it onto graham crackers for an afternoon snack.  The addition of the sourcream was wonderful and really cuts down on the thickness and richness of the peanut butter for people that don't care for peanut butter by itself.  Next time I will cut back on the amount of OJ.. It gave it a nice kick but was a bit much for our taste... Thanks for sharing....
166642,260312,2007-10-28,4,This is very good! I used a bittersweet chocolate and we loved the cinnamon/chocolate flavors together. I used it to frost a small chocolate cake! Delish!
204024,359550,2011-04-02,5,"Barbecue is a figure of speech here; the cup of barbecue sauce (we used baby Ray's) is as close as it gets to a grill.  But it's sweet, savory, tender, and delicious; there's lots of sauce in the pot that could be poured over rice; it's easy to make and pleasantly messy to eat, and all of us loved it. Made for 2010 Favorites game."
1215381,8183,2010-04-25,5,I made this exactly as directed and it is wonderful.  We had it with shrimp and beef tempura and it was a great dipping sauce.  Thanks for sharing.
2653009,181106,2013-01-23,5,Just made this bread - cannot believe how easy and delicious it is.  Thank you!!!
1767414,431671,2017-01-02,4,"Very easy, and quite tasty. Next time, I'll halve the added salt, as I found a half-teaspoon to be far too salty for my liking. I'm looking forward to summer when I can add fresh herbs to this dish."
1393860,17309,2009-11-17,5,"I thought this thing was...lick the bowl...delicious and I should know because I did just that.  This recipe will never be too far away because it satisfied my chocolate craving.  One thing I will do different next time is mash all the cocoa bumps out before adding the sweetened condensed milk.  Thank you...so very much...for contributing to my collection of fabulous recipes.  Sincerely, Sherry Belle"
820043,13906,2008-04-28,3,This again was good for quick male nothing special.  Good if you have no time to cook!
222564,191093,2010-07-06,5,"Nice and spritely salad, we especially liked the dressing and sugared pistachios, which I made sun dried rather than oven dried."
2002235407,110223,2018-07-31,5,"I've been craving my grandma's sauerkraut and kielbasa... I haven't had it since the early 1970's. Grandma Ruth would stand by the stove hovering over a large pot of sauerkraut, potatoes, and kielbasa, with a cigarette dangling out of the corner of her mouth, stirring and slow cooking all day long. I didn't have sage, so I used marjoram and oregano, and I doubled the seasoning amount. I also used a little chipotle powder instead of pepper and added a little beer to the mix. Smelled amazing as it cooked in the oven all afternoon long. It tasted even better than grandma's (especially since I omitted the occasional cigarette ash that fell into the pot while Grandma Ruth stirred the delicious mixture). Thanks for sharing. It brought joyful memories of weekends spent in upper Michigan at my grandparents' cottage on Lake Michigan."
1219702,117893,2009-07-12,5,"The great thing about this recipe is that it is flexible. Add stuff you like (chopped red cabbage is a personal favorite), omit stuff you don't. Do watch the vinegar, it does benefit from sugar. Also I don't use any salt because of a restricted diet. Experiment and enjoy!"
472052,126575,2007-08-16,5,"This is almost EXACTLY how I've been making crab cakes for the past several years. The only difference is I used Panko bread crumbs. I tried it this last time with the crackers, and I think I prefer the crackers! I used these as a base for my crab cake eggs benedict; which consists of a crab cake topped with a poached egg and a couple tablespoons of Recipe #245985 ! It was to DIE for! Thanks for posting the recipe so I didn't have to!"
245301,15870,2007-01-09,5,"Great flavor!  Loved the chicken mixture cooked in the stir fry sauce.  Also, really liked the two different dipping sauces.  I made the Ginger and Peanut dipping sauce the night before and just re-heated in the microwave.  The peanut dipping sauce didn't specify which type of peanut butter to use, so I used Jif crunchy and it turned out fine.  The directions also didn't say what to do with the sliced almonds.  I toasted those in a skillet and sprinkled over the assembled lettuce wraps.  My DH has requested that I make these once a week.  I don't know about that . . . I got almost every dish and pan in the house dirty with this recipe!  Great tasting recipe, but you'll have to work for it!"
680579,40118,2008-12-03,4,"This was very good.  Even better the next day.  Had to leave out the onions, because DH doesn't like them.  Next time I make it, I will use some for me.  Thanks for sharing."
131126,35833,2004-10-11,4,You want to talk hot??!!!Plan on eating with tears streaming down your face! My Dh has now decided he is allergic to cayenne pepper :) I will definitely cut back on the peppers the next time I make this. I served this with grilled vegetables & a wild rice pilaf.  Thanks Miller.
1797292,77965,2011-01-16,4,Very good recipe! Left out the egg
246367,98884,2005-12-01,5,"Thanks for the great recipe!I made this lastnight,and used olive oil instead of the butter to be a bit more healthy.Great flavor,and crunchy coating too."
59064,383,2004-01-09,4,Good cooling drink on a summer's day. The cocoa is on the strong side and the cream definitely needs to be sweetened to set off the vanilla and counteract the bitterness of cocoa.
199848,145842,2009-01-08,4,"This is very thick and cheesey.  I made this as written, but did add some chopped onion for more flavor.  Even with the onion, I think it could use more flavor, though.  I would recommend using chicken or veggie broth instead of plain water.   Thanx for posting this!"
259006,31516,2006-08-10,4,"Made this last night and found it easy to make and tasty.  Only problem was that the cooking time was way off. It took much longer than the 45 min. stated for the rice to be cooked through.  I eventually had to set the chicken aside b/c it was getting dry and put the rice back in the oven to cook some more.  I think next time what I'll do is use boneless skinless chicken thighs (b/c they can take a lot of abuse) and dice them up and mix them into the mixture, that way I won't have to be worrying about things cooking at different times.  Great complete meal for those busy weekdays when rounded out with a green salad.  Thanks Aroostook!"
1338684,105726,2010-09-23,5,Excellent!
1040581,168881,2012-01-01,5,"Easy, very fresh and light. I made these for New Years' and friends all loved them. I modified it a bit for what I had on hand. I doubled the cheeses but kept the butter the same (Turns out I didn't need to because this makes so much and is so flavorful.  I used lots of parsley, a small container of dill from the market, a few sprigs of rosemary (stems removed), a teaspoon of dried lavender, and four medium cloves of garlic that were boiled in water for 60 seconds to make a milder flavor. Salt and pepper to taste. I put all the herbs in the food processor first and then separately blended the  butter and cheeses so I could add the herb mixture to taste but ended up using all of the herbs (once processed they were more like a third of a cup- I'm guessing because I wasn't paying attention. Anyhow- it's a great cheese base and you can do anything with it. I served it on whole wheat crust-less bread cut in halves with some chopped radishes inside for crunch."

182010,112765,2006-07-15,5,"Once again, the Minx and I are on the same page.  This salsa is GREAT!  I had fresh lychee and I used cilantro and I loved it!  Thanks for a salsa that will become a regular around here!"
107583,480470,2012-12-23,5,"This is very tasty!  (and easy).  I did the stovetop version, but next time I am using the oven for other things too, I will try that method.  Thanks for a keeper."
63858,156268,2006-06-22,5,"Awesome great flavor, used those fancy cut thin chicken breast.  Cooked extremely fast served with fattoush, hummous and kibbee.  What a great addition to our meal.

39301,189389,2008-03-05,5,"Very easy and very tasty!  The kids gobbled this up.  I used boneless, skinless breasts and grilled them on the George Foreman, since we're having an ice storm right now (grin).  Thanks for posting."
199848,178714,2007-03-04,4,"I enjoyed this corn soup and I thought it was very easy to put together.  I only used a little over 1 tbsp of chipoltles and that was just the right amount for me.  I made this as written, and I think the 2 cups of water should be chicken (or veggie) broth.  After the soup was done, I tasted it, and went back and added some chicken bouillion.  That did the trick.  I did garnish with the fresh cilantro....I love the stuff.  The cheese-lovers out there might enjoy some pepper-jack cheese in or on top of this soup.  I will certainly make this again (with the broth of course).  Thanx for sharing this."

Last night I made it, just as stated.
I used fresh tomatoes, but 3 rather than 2.

Thank a lot love4culinary."
64625,223268,2007-05-31,5,"Not for the faint hearted! A robust, rich and filling meatloaf, unique among meatloaves I've encountered for its complex tastes (I feel as though I'm talking about wine!). Well worth making, though, it's easy. It gets 5 stars for its rich flavours, ease of prep and it yields a lot of servings! I used farmer's sausage, diced in place of Italian sausage as I couldn't get any that day. And it is enhanced by the sauce on top..I used chili sauce.  Tanks!!!"

102058,89411,2007-01-26,4,"Lovely potatoes, I didn't have King Edwards and trying to find the perfect roasting potato in the Netherlands seems more difficult a process than I first thought, as they are more a nation of stovetop cooks and most spuds are more suited to stovetop preperation. Still, these did reasonably well and with guests we didn't have too much problem to clean the pan.. no leftovers. I used a small amount of shortening I had left over and wow it was hot when these went in ! Sadly I also have an old and tempremental oven so had to juggle the cooking time a bit. Please see my rating system: 4 stars for a great recipe that brings me a step closer to the perfect roast potato.. all I need is a slightly better variety of potato and I'm there :) Thanks!"

We have found many great recipes for different dishes that have become a staple to each gathering, but the rice was always a big flop, until I so fortunately stumbled across this recipe.  It is all that everyone raves about and more.  It has been the best recipe that we have ever tried, and we have be through more rice recipes than you really could imagine.  I want you to know how appreciative I am that you posted this recipe as now, it is unanimous, this is the staple rice that will be served at all our family gatherings.  I didn't change a thing, it is perfect just as is, and simple-dimple to prepare.  People, please don't be shy or hesitant to try this recipe, it well earns five stars in my books!  Thanks again!!!!"

37449,128313,2005-09-19,5,A very nice wrap for a summer day! I made Mean Chef's Hummus recipe#104962. I used lentil sprouts because that's what I had on hand. Thank you!  :)

424680,413666,2011-07-21,5,"Followed your recipe right on down, even to including the mushrooms, but I did cook them only until they started to soften slightly & that was good enough for us, & the dish itself was a nice change from our usual chicken breasts!

689367,460106,2011-07-14,5,"We really liked this one! I didn't have cream so I used milk that I had shaken with some corn starch. I also used a whole chicken breast that I had smoked. To keep it from drying out, I added it with the pasta at the end. This recipe could benefit from some sour cream and or cheese but definitely doesn't need it. Thanks Q & A's mom for a keeper!"

457907,279230,2009-02-11,5,This was good for being lowfat.  It seemed like it was missing something.  I think some broth would be good.  I used green onions since we didn't have scallions and added 1 extra tbl soy sauce. Thanks for the easy recipe!

139200,4684,2007-07-27,5,"This marinade had the perfect combination of sweet and spice.  The honey was sweet, but the mustard and lime juice cut the chipotle chile spice so it wasn't so prominent!
Invited friends over and everyone was impressed with the meat!  We used tri-tip and it was amazing!
5 Stars!"
283611,40214,2008-08-10,5,Very good. I used brown rice. Added slightly more salt and curry. Yum. Will make again.

I also added 1 teaspoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry mix, I peeled the apples and did not add the nuts. I doubled the sauce recipe but even doubled the cake didn't look like MarieAlice's beautiful picture. I think next time I would still double the sauce but save some to spoon warm over each piece of cake."

I made my dough in the bread machine and then transferred it to a loaf pan, let it rise and baked it at 375 until brown and hollow sounding.  Great bread especially for toast.  Made for Photo Tag."
225096,192335,2006-11-05,5,This turned out great!  It was very moist and I liked the cheese on top.  I might add an egg next time to see if it might give it a little more height but it is wonderful exactly as posted!  I took it to work and people gobbled it up!  Thank you for posting!

The problem is, you have a lot of crabapples full of vodka left over. So I turned them into a crabapple sauce. I shared a lot of it, which was good, but still had a lot. So I combined it with this recipe: http://qc.allrecipes.ca/recette/12679/g-teau-moelleux-au-chocolat-et-compote-de-pomme.aspx Sorry, it's in French, but it is way too yummy, especially with the vodka-infused crabapple sauce and the added chocolate chips and dried cranberries! :-) It was a great hit at work."

 I have come across recipes like this before where the dough was dry and crumbly. You could add a few drops of milk to the batter. Any cookie made with shortening will cut down on the taste. It will give a nice crispness though which is one thing I wanted with this batch. Anyhow, thankyou for posting."

Can't say if the final product is good or bad, but I do know that it using it in the other recipe for a 'fruit loaf' made for a great-tasting treat! Thanks much for your recipes, French Tart ~ They're always so handy & trustworthy!"
546022,427534,2014-07-27,5,"Excellent - I tweeked it, as well, reducing the salt to 3/4 tsp and the baking powder to 1 3/4 tsp and I added a little more water and some peanut flour. I have some barley and garbanzo flours I&#039;d like to &#039;mask&#039; and will be using them up, gradually, as I make more batches of this. I&#039;ll also try some &#039;sweet&#039; versions and will try a garlic and herb version for a pizza crust. Thanks so much for posting!"
1761029,40076,2010-12-14,5,"I didn't want my cookies to be so big, so I just molded enough dough around the Snickers to cover it.  I made the recipe as written and ended up with 36 cookies.  They are FANTASTIC...and a hit everywhere I've brought them."
121796,15909,2006-10-30,4,instead of brandy I did citrus vodka and wow that was some nice zip for an after dinner dessert/drink!!
133680,50338,2004-11-28,5,Very tasty! I used the black beans with jalpenos and Ro-tel diced tomatoes with green chilies. Put some zip in it. I keep this cans on hand for a quick meal. Thanks for sharing!
222564,19678,2007-04-26,5,"Couldn't be better - and easier! I like the fact that it is wonderful tasting and only uses plain cocoa, sugar and water, and not much else. All of them are always readily available, no matter what."
653438,230232,2009-11-22,5,"This was a delicious and easy soup to make...I would recommend it to everyone!!  I cut the recipe in half for DH and I, followed the directions to a tee and served it with some garlic bread.   Next time I might add some cayenne pepper for a little zip and try some wine like a previous cook posted (but you really don't need it).   Took it down to the coast and totally enjoyed our lunch.  Thank you.  Made for Zaar Alphabet Soup Tag game 2009."
743373,85178,2008-02-14,5,"The marinade was fantastic! I only made a small amount to try this time, but now I'm going to make a big batch and store it for quick use. I did eliminate the oil and some of the salt, and added a bit more water and ketchup. Thank you so much for this recipe!"
593927,334802,2010-02-17,5,4 1/2 stars. This was good but I couldn't taste the ginger.
107135,432710,2014-08-22,5,really good good breakfast drink used frozen mango instead of ice  cakepops on parade s/a leg of tour
60992,235381,2009-12-06,5,"WOW!!! This is absolutely amazing! This would be good enough to give out as gifts but you won't want to part with it! I got 4 1 liter bottles and 1 1.75 liter bottles full! With a little bit leftover. My Dad told me at the bar by his cabin they sell this stuff at $3 a shot! The flavor is rich and comforting and be careful this does pack a punch, but is SO worht feeling KO'ed in the morning! :)"
58407,19793,2008-01-29,2,"We all love Ruebens, so I am really sorry to say that we did not care for this very much. We had game night at my mom's on Saturday. There were 5 of us. My sister-in-law took this from my recipes I had printed out and brought it. She followed the recipe exactly. Everyone tried it and no one rated it above a 1 star, except me. I felt it was worth 3, so I decided to hit in the middle and give 2. I felt it would've been better warm, since I've never had a cold Rueben sandwich. My mom tried a bit of it heated in the microwave and said it was a little better that way, but she wanted no more.

I thank you for the opportunity to try your recipe, but unfortunately it just wasn't for us."
337668,191946,2010-06-15,5,"Wow!  What a wonderful dish!  I had to prepare a bit of it the night before, but it was worth it!  We cook a bit with the crock pot in the sunmmer since we don't have ac.  I used the entire can of tomatoes and just dumped all of the liquid in with it.  I also used london broil only becuase it was on sale.  I cooked it on low since I usually set it and go to work, so it cooked for about 10 hours on low.  The meat was just a little dry but it was very tender.  I may decide not to cut it into cubes next time just because it was cooking for so long.  Hubby requested that I make this again, so it's on the rotation.  Thanks for posting!  Made for ZWT6, Redhot Renegades."
169357,376,2009-05-31,5,"Fantastic!  I made these to use up some yellow squash and zucchini.  I made quantity for 6 servings, added a whole can of corn, and a tablespoon of sugar.  Served alongside baked fish sticks."
763431,52206,2009-08-02,4,"This only made one loaf for me, but I still enjoyed it.  I used 3/4 C whole wheat pastry flour and 3/4 C All purpose flour.  I only used 1/2 C brown sugar (packed).  I added 1 T. ground flax seed, 1 t. cinnamon, and 1/2 C toasted walnuts.  Very moist and yummy.  Can't wait to try it with dried cranberries next time."
442170,66121,2007-05-11,5,Very good recipe.  Tastes just like the original.
632249,101657,2008-06-22,0,"I am going to rate this without stars as they did not turn out well for me.  I heeded other reviews about the ""copycat"" bisquick making these bars greasy. Therefore I reduced the oil to a few tablespoons and used applesauce for the rest.  This caused the bars to be terribly dry.  If I try these again, I would go with a bit less oil than the original recipe calls for and see what happens.  I made these two days ago and still have 3/4 of the pan left since no one liked them.   Will try again though since others seem to really enjoy them."
864044,125282,2008-07-09,5,"Grilled Ham and Cheese meets French toast- the flavors were great! I did not care for the mustard, but that is left off easily enough. I grilled the bread first with a spray of butter flavored non-stick spray and used ff American cheese and lf Cheddar with thin sliced ham. I also used lite bread and halved the recipe. Very tasty!"
1293707,253891,2011-01-18,5,"These are delicious! I didn't have any baking powder, so tried to wait until I could get some, then decided to just go for it! It worked!! oh wow, yum. Thank you!"
206747,263091,2008-08-27,0,"Have not accomplished this successfully yet, but a comment may save some other's attempts.  I used already popped corn, in a bag from Bed, Bath, and Beyond -- where 3 people stopped to tell me what wonderful popcorn it was !  (What I ate plain IS tasty !!)  I used bittersweet chocolate bits, which sort of just clumped up after nuking.  I asked the chef, who said be very attentive to the melting -- chips should retain their shape but be easily stirred to melted.  I think bittersweet may act differently than milk chocolate.  Second important thing to watch -- recipe says  ""CARAMEL"" popped corn -- the BB&B was not.  I believe the hard shell keeps the corn from becoming soggy.  By the time my chocolate had hardened, the corn was no longer crisp.  I am not giving up !!  The Moose Munch website says Target carries it -- but not in MY hometown !!  Next time I will use the specified ingredients BEFORE making any changes !  Thanks for your help, Luvs2Cook."
66411,321517,2009-03-27,3,"Despite the one poor rating given, and only two good ones, I opted to try this one out. Unfortunately, the chicken was unimpressive, and even with the flame very low (as low as possible without it going out) the onions were quickly on their way to turning black in under ten minutes. The garlic, roasted and spread over the chicken, just formed a layer of garlic- I think it could have better been implemented into the sauce rather then put directly on the chicken. I might possibly make this again, but with some changes to better suit my tastes."
672478,51517,2008-02-04,5,"I never had pasta with oil & garlic till I was out of spaghetti sauce and I needed to use some left over spaghetti I had made.  This was DELICIOUS! Instead of using fresh , I used dried (cheaper for us, we are on a tight budget). Also, I used chopped garlic out of a jar instead of fresh, which to me, taste just as good and much quicker. :-)  The kids loved this simple dish ! A keeper and will make often, especially since it's easy, fast, and affordable!"
705251,139928,2009-08-15,5,I'm raving about this dish!  My DS and I enjoyed this so much!!  The bananas were perfectly baked with the chocolate and nuts in 8 minutes!  I even was able to use some really ripe bananas for this recipe.  My DS said - wouldn't this be great with a scoop of icecream too - so I think next time we are going to try that for fun!  I did make a change and used chopped almonds in place of the macadamia nuts (too expensive here right now) and they tasted great!  Thanks blue for a great keeper!!  Made for the Gimme 5 Tag Game.  :)
329638,48331,2009-04-11,5,"Great recipe, it's the one very similar to what I grew up with.  Since we never have a bowl big enough to easily stir the coating and popcorn, we use 2 large PAPER grocery sacks (clean ones, unused).  We spreay the inside of each of them lightly with cooking spray before dividing the popcorn between them- it seems to help keep the coating from sticking.   Then we divide the coating between the bags- generally one ends up with a little more coating than the other, which works out perfectly after its baked and mixed up anyway.  After pouring the coating on, we fold over the top of the paper bags  twice, leaving room for the corn and caramel to flip around, and shake them vigorously.  Dump out on your pan, and voila!  Easy cleanup too.  Thanks for posting!"
1270276,109884,2015-08-29,5,Moist and delicious.  Will definetly bake this time and time again!
2207750,142961,2012-03-10,5,"Add more mix to your waffle iron than you think you might be able to.  I ended up adding the remainder of the mix on the last waffle, it was more than I used on the other waffles.  Although they all turned out great, the last one was a bit thicker with more mix.  The mix is a bit runny so it seems like you don't want to add too much but you can fill your iron. <br/><br/>WE LOVE THESE WAFFLES!!!They are so fluffy and super easy to make!! I added just a touch of brown sugar to sweeten them up a bit.  I put the liquid ingredients in the blender to get it nice and smooth and then added the dry ingredients to which I also added a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also cut the vanilla extract in half and added almond extract for the rest...so half a teaspoon of each.  <br/>Delicious; my five year old and 2 year old loved them and I was happy that they were getting a little more protein in their meal ;)"
2503517,89207,2013-03-03,5,This is the best recipe i have used!!! I added extra creamer!
830498,205367,2012-03-17,1,"I don't know what went wrong but mine came out so bland that it's not worth eating.  I put all the stuff in, followed the direction, and nothing worth fixing again.  I was so looking forward to a wonderful meal for my family, but it was a failure."
335614,169813,2007-06-30,5,"Oh, wow. Yum. I could eat this butter on just about anything, but to put it with some fresh sweet corn, it's just heavenly. I loved every bite."
113517,110846,2005-10-16,5,"loved the chili!   I made it in the crockpot, after the sauteeing part.  New family favorite."
18649,27208,2002-07-29,5,This was the best tasting roast I have had in a very long time.  I added carrots and potatoes and they had a super flavor to them.  I added the full packages and it was perfect for our tastes. I made the sauce into gravy and served it over the roast and veggies. Great Stuff!! Even my picky three year old asked for seconds. Thanks!!
166642,291758,2008-08-24,5,This was a great marinade! I marinated the steaks for most of the day and they turned out tender and moist. This simple marinade has great flavor. I love that it has ingredients I always have on hand.
28170,79714,2008-12-20,4,I made it for one using Roosie's measurements.  Very good and warming.  Not too sweet.  Thanks.  Maybe next time I will be daring and add a dash of cayenne pepper.
51199,73894,2004-10-19,5,My little son loved this recipe (and so did we). I used light evaporated milk instead of the cream content and served this with spaghetti. Definitely a kid pleaser recipe if ever I saw one. Thanks.
169430,390564,2011-11-28,0,"I made a half recipe and now I wish I had made the whole amount because I'm thinking that an applesauce cake in in order. Used 1 1/2 tsps the Splenda brown and red delicious (the only apples I had on hand) and let it cook down for at least 6 hrs. This is simply good eating just as it comes out of the crock pot, all you need is a spoon!"
542159,177038,2009-07-19,5,"Delicious, quick and easy. We like our coffee black so we tasted this before adding any sugar and found it was great with the evaporated milk, ice and coffee. Did put in the blender to make a nice smooth latte. Thanks so much for the post."
95697,31320,2004-02-21,5,"These were fabulous!  I always get toasted ravioli when I'm in St. Louis, and these tasted just the same!  I served them with a salad and some garlic bread for lunch.  Very easy recipe.  I'm sure I'll be making these again!"
2434579,143736,2012-10-05,0,"I read some of the reviews and like many I prefer a somewhat crunchy hot carrot like the ones to be had in San Diego (grew up there).  I halved the boiling time, but with the cooling down period, it's still much too long.  I'm thinking that really they don't need to be boiled at all, but rather bring the water to a boil, then remove from heat, put in carrots immediately along with all other ingredients and go from there.  I also added some chopped cilantro, cumin seeds, and fresh sliced jalapeno peppers for even more heat.  The flavor is great, just next time, not boiling the carrots at all."
135870,277130,2018-03-25,5,Saved the day for me. It's evening and I don't want to run to the store just to get a can of cream of chicken soup. Most recipes call for dried milk. I don't have any of that so it was a relief to find this recipe. I had all the ingredients on hand! Thanks a bunch. I will probably use this in the future. It is definitely a more healthy choice than the canned soup.
824349,136589,2008-10-20,4,"PERFECT FOR AUTUMN!  The only reason I gave this 4 stars, instead of 5, was because I was looking for more of a ""cake"" texture. I shared these with neighbors, and they all really liked them... even the next morning. Good flavor, but much more of a bread texture. If you are looking for a dense, chunky, homey dessert, this is the one for you.  I made these as cupcakes, and topped them with a caramel (topping) swirl and a small pretty, piped star of cinnamon cream cheese frosting. I will make these again, but as a ""muffin"" instead of ""cupcake""... then I think I would have to give this recipe 5 stars."
373495,384035,2009-12-29,3,"I really liked the idea of this crust, but it was a lot of extra work for just an OK flavor."
930100,90375,2010-11-14,5,"My husband made this for dinner tonight. We both really enjoyed it. I used your suggestions and made with Pyramid Apricot ale, topped with sour cream and cilantro and served with crusty bread. Delicious dish, we will make again."
2001480580,381148,2017-04-09,0,"My looked just like the pic, turned out great!"
180192,110753,2005-10-30,4,"Very good, sturdy sugar cookies. They aren't overly sweet on their own, which is good, since you'll add decorative sugar, or glaze them. I baked them for 8 - 9 minutes (we like a softer cookie). "
106682,76043,2009-05-31,5,These were very tasty and easy to prepare.  I will be making my stuffed peppers this way from now on.  thank you for posting.
1483642,247595,2011-05-28,5,Added some breadcrumbs to help it all stay together and it was great!  Will definitely make it again.
124249,9055,2008-11-30,5,"This made a flavorful green bean dish, Very easy to prepare. 

Thanks Thomas DAnler.

646304,244592,2010-02-26,3,"What a gooey mess!! The flavor was ok, if I do these again, more garlic, and less pepper.  I was making these for company, and based on the reviews, doubled the batch. They do not look pretty at all when deep fried, because they do not hold together well.  However, instead of throwing half the batch out, I baked them at 400 on a greased cookie sheet, flipping 1/2 way through.  That gave them the consistancy of shape that I wanted to serve to guests.  thanks for sharing"
339260,182997,2008-08-04,5,"I love fresh ginger, so I knew I was going to enjoy this dish.   I was planning on making this on the grill, but due to thunderstorms, I had to cook them in my grill pan on the stove top.  I loved the smell of the glaze as it was reducing.  My whole house smelled like ginger.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.  Made for August, 2008 Aussie/NZ Swap."
76535,105814,2004-12-13,4,Different and good. Very simple to make for weeknight dinner.
2002262147,263929,2018-08-31,0,"I used a dehydrator to dry mine and I put them in ziplock freezer bags put them in the freezer, and they lasted a year! no messy oil!"
31138,30706,2002-10-03,5,"these are great! I have never had cooked avocados before so I was a liitle bit leary, but they turned out to be delicious. I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs either so I made up my own. I threw in some caraway seeds, they complement the avocado so well!"
441444,150265,2007-01-30,5,"i made this for a potluck at work tomorrow, but it looked so good i had to dig in about an hour ago... yum-o! it is so flavorful with the green chiles, but not spicy, and i love the crust on the top but the moist and soft (and cheesy!) middle. I think i might try it with a little sour cream garnish. wow i need to put my fork down and save some for my coworkers. super easy and reminds me of why i love potlucks!"
102602,18762,2003-09-23,5,"Delicious!! I love the lemon, garlic and oregano flavor, next time I'll be doubling up on the garlic. I let the potatoes marinate for an hour before baking. They tasted soooo good. I'll definitely be making this recipe again. Mirj, thanks so much for your geeky Greek potatoes!"
41509,134470,2010-02-18,5,It IS AMAZING!  We all loved it! I didn't add onions or ham (didn't have any) but it was DELISH with just bacon and sausage!  Definitely a keeper! THANKS!
2348748,19710,2012-07-31,0,"That was delish! We tried it with some butter. I added some garlic powder, onion powder and paprika. It was awesome. Thank You."
2001310596,343698,2016-12-21,4,It took longer to bake than 20 minutes is it so for everyone ?
322326,158686,2008-03-06,5,"I made this for my friend as we have this ongoing joke about maltessars, I never got to try it due to lent, but she said that it was delicous and almost by herself ate the entire thing in one sitting! Other friends came up to me to tell me how good it was aswell. thanks for posting, Miss Pixie x x x :D"
2002195550,63071,2018-06-23,5,"Only tweak I made was reducing the oil by 1/2, so I used 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup. Came out very nice and fluffy inside, crispy outside. Used a scant 1 cup batter per waffle in my Presto waffle iron, which was the perfect amount. These are sweet; you don't need much maple syrup. I might try reducing the sugar a bit next time. Will make again."
47907,91093,2006-07-26,5,We LOVE salt potatoes and these are great!  Takes us right back to our camp in the Adirondacks!!!  I made as posted using kosher salt and small new potatoes I bought at the farmer's market today.  Very yummy!  Thanks for posting!!!
10033,14577,2002-05-21,5,"These were INCREDIBLE!!!! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I LOOOOOOVE portobello mushrooms and I have been trying not to eat any carbs for dinner or lunch  so this was perfect....funny I never thought of replacing *bread* with mushrooms! Thanks so much for posting!! I'll make these quite often!"
97901,381082,2009-07-17,4,I made this using the applesauce substitution. It took alot longer than posted to cook it down but that might be b/c of the applesauce. It is very sweet. I was afraid it wasn't going to set up b/c of the lack of pectin but it did just fine. I didn't use the brandy b/c I didn't have any. I got 6 half-pints from it.
22973,12662,2003-05-22,5,"Kat,
  Yum,this was so thick and so filling,and was soooooo GOOD.When you were full (which did not take long) You still wanted to keep eating it.I crumbled my bacon over my soup after it was in the bowl,andjust before serving it,Wonderful.
Thanks so much,
Darlene Summers "
226863,472989,2012-01-31,5,"Fabulous!  I didn't realize till the very end that I didn't have water chestnuts, but those aren't my favorites, so I'm glad I neglected to include them.  Loved the worcestershire/wine mix.  Usually use this when I saute mushrooms anyway, and the spinach was a beautiful bonus.  Just delicious.  Made for Newest Tag....thanks for sharing!"
447921,96714,2007-04-24,4,"We enjoyed this one a lot, and it gave me another way to use up my applesauce. It's funny, I was thinking it would be good with raisins before I read the other reviews. Maybe plump up a half cup of raisins in some apple cider or Calvados and throw them in when it beeps? Might have to cut back on the applesauce that way, though. Hmmm. Sounds like another project! Thanks Marie."
636875,73264,2009-02-08,5,"We just got done having this for breakfast. I made it minus the pecan, because I don't have any right now. We loved it! It tasted great. I love the custardy texture, and the taste of the nutmeg. The only thing I didn't like was that it stuck to the pan. Instead of soaking the bread in the pan next time I'll soak it in the bowl then place it in the pan, so I'm not messing with the non-stick spray. Thanks for the recipe, it was wonderful!"
324790,373453,2009-12-14,5,"I really enjoyed the taste of this.  I used garlic & olive oil tomato accents, instead of plain tomatoes which added to the flavour.   I even shredded some mozarella over my serving & melted it in the microwave (which gave it a pizza-like flavour).  This is a very versatile recipe.   Tonite, I am browning some lean ground beef & mixing it with the remainder for a heartier ""dh"" friendly meal.   Thanks Shuzbud!  Made for Everyday Holiday Tag-Dec09."
383346,449235,2011-04-26,5,This is a great recipe of banana bread.  I made half the recipe cause I wanted to do 12 muffins.  But I got enough for 6 muffins.  So next time I will do the whole recipe so maybe I'll have the 12 muffins.  The orange taste is so good.  The muffins are moist.  Thanks for posting :)  Made for I Recommend tag game
520644,374105,2010-08-04,5,"Wonderful recipe!  I did cut down about 1/3 of the sugar, and only used 1/4 of the hot sauce.  Next time I think I will use 1/2 of the hot sauce.  We grilled it on top of foil and kept basting it as it grilled.  The sauce caramelized on the foil.  It was great.  I served this with garlic ranch mashed potatoes."
1515092,263822,2010-01-28,5,Our family really enjoyed this simple and delicious recipe.  I'll definitely send this one on to my friends!  GREAT recipe...YUM YUM!
136074,69865,2004-06-28,5,This is GREAT! So simple and quick and delicious! Easy to remember (which is good because have had to pass it on!) and easy to vary. Had with brocolli and chicken per suggestion and made it a meal! 
720215,157068,2009-07-09,5,"Amazing!!!!  I loved this recipe.  I am a huge fan of cilantro.  I used Recipe #39269 to cook the rice which was great.  I was a little nervous about the lime and only used one.  That was just enough to brighten up the rice and the cilantro added so much.  It makes such a difference to use fresh cilantro instead of dried.  Very good recipe, thanks for sharing!!!"
348523,279026,2009-02-02,5,We served this at a party and it was a hit with everyone. Everyone in my family loves it.
320870,29440,2008-03-01,5,Loved this dish!!  Quick & easy & something NEW to do with greenbeans.  I roasted mine for about 45 mintues  cuz my pan was a little small.  I loved the flavor of the balsamic with the garlic.  DH loves greenbeans so I'll be making this again soon.  Thanks for a great recipe!
1613349,47637,2010-12-03,4,I have a slight variation to add for those pressed for time.  I made the recipe up but skipped making the balls.  Instead  I added the peanut butter/rice crispies mixture directly to the melted chocolate and dropped by teaspoonfuls onto the waxed paper.  Very easy and very tasty.
38745,83577,2006-10-01,5,"Glittergirl, this is the closest recipe I've run across to what an old room mate used to make (with a few changes, but I wanted to give you the credit, because I did use your recipe.  First, I'm estimating that I quadrupled the recipe.  I used all the ingredients you listed, but instead of shredded cheddar cheese, I used a 1/2 loaf of Velveeta, that is what my room mate used.  I ground my ham myself with my grinder attachment for my kitchen aide.  I also ran a medium sized onion through the grinder.  With my hamburger buns, I lightly buttered them and sprinkled some garlic powerder on them and put them under the broiler.  After they were done, I put some ham spread on the toast and wrapped them as you instructed.  These were so good.  Thank you for the great recipe."
1743422,477371,2012-12-01,5,"These were great. They needed a bit of salt at the table, so maybe next time I'll go half low sodium, half regular soy sauce. Otherwise, made them as directed and they were great! I made my own marmalade using this recipe: http://www.food.com/recipe/easy-orange-marmalade-78925<br/>Delightful."
192264,123208,2010-08-26,5,My friend made these with the addition of 1/4 cup sugar to the recipe. She used canned sweet potatoes that had been drained and mashed. They were yummy!
810391,136996,2008-04-05,0,"Excellent!  Excellent!  We added ""rice stick"" noodles like you see in the store bought ones.  Fun to make and tasty to eat!"
2000067037,101703,2015-03-16,5,Delicious! I made it tonight and it was so easy to make. My husband and I loved the result!
148159,16531,2008-05-22,5,Everyone in the house loved this!  I used boneless breasts as suggested by another reviewer and adjusted the cooking time. It came out wonderfully!
916602,223104,2013-04-08,0,Delicious!  I was looking for a shortcake that didn&#039;t taste as bland as the Bisquick kind of shortcake and THIS WAS IT!  Turned out perfect by following Kittencals recipe to the T.  It is moist and the almond is a great compliment to the strawberries.
230860,190372,2008-03-30,5,"Don't let the seemingly simple ingredients list fool you!  This dish packs a LOT of flavor!  It is SO incredibly good!  It is basically shrimp scampy in many ways, but the parsley gives it that ""freshness"" that keeps you from feeling like you are drowning in butter lol.  I added a red bell pepper to it also since I had one that needed to be used up and it was so perfect in this dish.  It too lent the dish a bit of freshness and I left them just a bit crisp.  I used more parsley than it called for since I love it and I think next time I would use more garlic too.  Towards the end we could really taste the lemon in it which was also a great addition.  And you MUST pair this with a peach or any other fruity wine!!!!!  It was the PERFECT pairing!  I actually think next time I would sub the broth for the wine as well to really tie them together.  Just perfect!"
2810361,145464,2013-05-02,5,Added in a few squirts of Sriracha and jalapenos in place of green chiles and it was fabulous &lt;3. I served it over tortilla chips and it has definitely curbed my craving for nachos
171790,366724,2009-09-15,5,"This worked for me, too. I've had trouble sleeping lately but last night a had a great night's sleep! I used whole milk and included the brandy. Made for PRMR Tag."
152195,346546,2009-02-10,4,"Very good!  I think it needed more gravy, but that could have just been because I put so many veggies in it.  Thanks!"
96177,323548,2009-07-10,5,We loved the addition of the mustard. Made for 123 tag. Thanks for a great meal.
222696,17582,2005-10-18,4,"These tasted good, and the baking time was correct. Also, the instructions were clear, and I think the recipe would be good for beginners--I made it for a bake sale on a busy day really late at night and it was quick and easy. However, they are really not like brownies AT ALL. They are super-moist, but definitely of cake consistency. They also puff up like a cake, since they are made from cake mix. I hadn't planned on frosting them, but when I saw how cake-like they were, I felt they needed the frosting. Additionally, I added butterscotch chips to the batter. I loved that they stayed so moist. "
457230,35367,2009-10-17,2,"This recipe sounded really good, but it doesn't really taste any different from a traditional bread pudding recipe.  If I am going to make a recipe as indulgent as the ingredients in this one, I want it to taste indulgent and this recipe does not.  It just tastes like a sweeter version of bread pudding without the cinnamon and spices."
47892,379770,2009-07-07,5,"Delicious! Fresh lavender from our garden was used for this recipe to marinate drumsticks for 24 hours; crushed lavender flowers in place of the essence, local organically grown garlic and local clover honey.  Roasted the drumsticks at 350 degrees for 1 hour in a grill pan. Served with wild rice pilaf, Recipe #282732 and focaccia.~Tasty Dish~ approved, too! Thank you, French Tart! cg"
2001362355,200296,2018-03-25,5,"This was easy, didn't take long to bake and really tasty. Good combination of items for breaking. I had three big chicken breasts cut in half that I used. I did turn my chicken over and cook another 10 minutes but used a glass baking dish."
604625,79943,2007-10-04,5,this is the best crust ever
1242997,8701,2011-01-15,5,"These ribs are amazing!  Actually the sauce is amazing and makes lots that could be used on anything that you like a great BBQ sauce on...absolutely divine!<br/>I used St Louis style ribs and fresh garlic.  Set the oven at 375 for an hour, turned down to 250 for 2 more, then let them simmer at 350 without the lid. Yummers!!!!"
63108,101673,2005-04-19,5,YUM! I served these for dinner and everyone LOVED them! Thank you for a great recipe.
222564,916,2013-12-17,5,Very nice and fun! Like a deep fried waffle. I increased the salt to 1 1/2 ts and there is much more dough than for 6 servings.
385678,117412,2008-06-21,5,This was a delicious oatmeal and made such a nutritious breakfast!  The peaches made it so yummy!  We used honey and a little sugar.  Thank you!  Made for ZWT4 - Los Jefes de la Cocina.
2000879035,375203,2016-08-06,5,"I have been making this marinade for a couple of years. Every single person who has had it, loves it. Very tasty."
58104,181386,2007-06-25,5,I had only the blue Curacao so I`d say it more of an Acapulco ocean. Thanks!
37721,356212,2011-03-20,5,"Good stuff! I had a 3.8 pound roast. Ran out of red wine vinegar, so I used the apple cider vinegar I had on hand. Three hours at 350Â° covered with the normal dutch oven lid. Fork tender at that point. Thanks for sharing."
128473,69850,2010-03-11,4,"Lovely pancakes chelgilm. I really enjoyed the homemade blueberry sauce.  It was so quick and easy to make.  The pancakes were light and fluffy. I did add a little extra milk, personal preference only. Thank you so much for sharing."
2130957,104134,2012-11-09,5,Very good!
92006,373245,2009-06-12,5,"I was afraid my kids wouldn't like the spiciness of this chicken, but they cleaned their plates! I used fresh garlic because I didn't have powder. Also, I added the cayenne only to the adult's half of the chicken. To cook the chicken, I first browned it in a cast iron skillet, then I put the skillet in the oven to finish cooking and poured about half the marinade on top. The marinade was a little salty, so I wont add as much salt next time. I liked this cooking method because the onions and bell pepper served as a garnish. Served it with Recipe #373001 and steamed broccoli. Thank you Sue! Made for ZWT5 & Dining Daredevils."
498271,175886,2010-06-23,4,"Yummy french toast!  The English muffins really soaked up the egg mixture well and were more tender than I thought they'd be.  Nice recipe - thanks for posting it!  Made for ZWT6, Zwizzle Chicks"
446143,91519,2008-01-15,4,Easy to make and comforting.  Thought it needed a little more liquid.
2324309,479053,2012-07-10,5,"Lots of flavor in this dish, everything blended nicely and had a nice fresh texture. This was a great salad to bring to a cookout, just add the dressing when you get there so it doesn't get soggy.  Everyone loved it - especially the men!  I served it as written, but forgot the onion.  I also had tortilla strips on the side for those that wanted some extra crunch.  It was a big hit and I had many requests for the recipe, even had a friend call me from the grocery store!"
175727,242851,2011-01-03,5,"Apparently, I forgot to critique this!  Made this a few months back for DH and I. . it was easy, filling, good flavor and DH loved it!<br/><br/>Thanks"
19372,236658,2013-08-27,5,"Since I found this recipe a few months ago I have made them several times a week. They are awesome!  They also freeze well. I shape them, freeze them on a cookie sheet, and bag them when they are froze.  I have made cinnamon rolls using this recipe, too. Two days ago I made them, again.  This time I melted a little butter, mixed in a little garlic powder, and brushed it on the dough after I rolled it out. I then sprinkled a little Parmesan cheese on it, cut and rolled them. Ohhh....the family loves them!!!"
2002057448,9421,2018-03-17,5,"Made these with my little sister today, they were super easy and we didn't have to get any ingredients that weren't already in the cupboard, they don't look the best but taste amazing and can be in super cute shapes (we did stars and hearts)"
299707,43826,2006-09-12,4,"This recipe is so easy and very yummy. We took Daphne's advise and at them all warm, straight from the oven."
226867,57767,2008-09-23,5,"My DH loved this, I liked it too, but I think I mis-interpreted the amounts. I used half of a red (bell) pepper - should it have been a hot pepper? Also, I subbed a 7 inch long zucchini for the cuke, used 5 eggs and a 15 ounce can of straw mushrooms. For the oil in the eggs, I used sesame oil and a few drops of hot sauce. I should have used a lot more salt and pepper and more cilantro/coriander. I did not use lettuce but did make ""tater tots"" and garlic toast. There were so many (yummy) veggies that it was more like scrambled eggs - couldn't get the omlet to stay together. But I will be making this again with a bit of extra seasonings!"
153878,68170,2005-12-04,5,"WOW!! We used sugar free apple pie filling, Splenda, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. Wonderful! Thank you for the recipe."
37636,34276,2002-10-24,5,"WOW! This was absolutely wonderful! It had a very refreshing taste, the thing I always look for in a salad. The flavor was mild- yet a tiny bit piquant, but I did add some more chili oil (I couldn't help myself, I love it hot!). I also added some chopped cilantro for color, but someone might just as easily add some chopped parsley. It did add to the appearance overall. Those were my only touches, but this salad was great even on its own. Thanks, Miss Annie!"
231612,269631,2008-03-14,2,"I'm so sorry to have to do this, but this recipe just didn't work for me at all. It sounded like it would be something I would love! As there is no baking temperature listed, I ended up borrowing my baking instructions and time from the other great turkey meatloaf recipe I have tried from Zaar (Recipe #115278.) This worked nicely, but in the end the flavor seemed too sweet without something else, maybe a strong spice to balance it out a little. Unlike some other recipes I'm not immediately sure what needs to change so I'm not confident enough to try it again and see if I can find a way to improve it. Here's to hoping this dish will be enjoyed by others instead."
1801272504,111625,2017-10-02,5,I first made this recipe in home ec when I was in school. That is now over 50 years ago. We have loved it ever since. I don't change anything. It is one of my favorite recipes of all time.
67656,77465,2004-11-24,5,"I used devil's food cake with walnuts and dried cranberries. My taste testers gave them a big thumbs up.  Easy to make, they'll be a welcome addition to my holiday gift trays this season."
335614,316250,2010-05-23,5,"This is really tasty, and super easy. I like the richness of the bacon with the spinach, and the little hint of sugar. I'm thinking it would be really easy to adapt this to match the flavors of many kinds of meals by changing up the vinegar, or adding various herbs and spices. Very, very nice. We did find that the vinegar is a bit strong if the dressing is very hot, and allowing it to cool for a few minutes before tossing it with the spinach made it much milder, which we liked."
4439,266241,2007-11-19,5,"what a woman, i was going to post this recipe, too, lol. thanks for saving me the trouble. this makes a realllly good bread pudding and gets rid of those pesty leftover buns. thanks again for posting this. dh loves this recipe."
94355,304604,2008-11-04,5,"Yes!!!!!  SO GOOD!!!  My husband and I are starving students, and this both fit our budget and and tasted amazing!!!  We ate it with salsa, cheese, and tortilla chips.  There are some many options for this recipe...  Thank you!!"
98761,133816,2009-06-23,5,"I thought this was a wonderful way to use up turkey, as well as all the other left overs.   I used all dark meat, since i'd already froze the white meat.  It worked fine.  I also added cooked carrots left from Recipe #152441 from mama's kitchen.  I added the carrots after the celery and onions were cooked.  I didn't have sweet potatos, so I used regular mashed potatos and added even more.  Anyway, it all turned out very good.  This recipe has wonderful potential for a great deal of variety.  I think the turkey filling part would be good in turkey pot pies.  I think I'll try peas in it next time.  Thanks for a great recipe."
173838,291460,2009-10-21,5,"Thanks for posting such a tasty recipe; my family really enjoyed it. FYI, the brown sugar amount should be 1/4 cup and the steak seasoning--2 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon, according to Ray's recipe on the Web."
1221468,188770,2011-11-01,5,"Excellent!!!!! Almost like the CCFactory...and the reason why I say Almost..probably cause I couldn't find Madeira Wine..so I used Port wine...but still VERY good!!! And yes, like the original, the sauce was not very thick....So happy I found this recipe!!!"
284897,26714,2007-11-27,5,"Wonderful and easy recipe mielhollinger. 
I actually needed some coconut milk for **Jubes** Recipe #220272, I thought I had coconut milk and when it was time to add it ....... GASP!!
I then found this recipe and it worked so very well, I was amazed at how quick and easy it was !!
Thanks again, this great recipe got me out of spot!"
184081,107674,2005-01-17,5,"Thank you for sharing this recipe. Made it today and  added a little garlic and paprika (plus a little more salt and pepper)and the result was very yummy and tender chicken. After Stephen finished eating his words were, 'mmmm you'll be making that again. Put it into 'keepers''. So five stars from both of us :D"
151325,109297,2005-05-05,5,"Mmmmmm, this is great comfort food!  It is easy to make and tastes wonderful.  

I suspected I'd need less stock, so started off with about half the quantity and added more as the stock was absorbed; in the end I did use a bit less.  However I was probably generous with the butter and cheese :-) (I used mature chedder) and served this with vegetarian sausages. 

Sylvie, I hope you get round to  making this dish soon.  We'll definately be having it again!"
53932,98158,2006-04-23,5,I first made this recipe quite some time ago after finding it in a Land o Lakes butter recipe booklet.  That recipe called for summer savory rather than lemon pepper.  I also use frozen green beans rather than canned.  This recipe has stood the test of time in our family.
594476,93781,2011-12-24,5,"Excellent scones. I've used this recipe the last several years, during the holidays, and now family and neighbors ask, ""when are you making those scones?"""
199848,348416,2013-08-12,5,"This soup is easy, filling, and healthy; what&#039;s not to love?  I do recommend using a good-quality salsa for this (like the fresh refrigerated salsa).   It&#039;s a very flexible recipe as well.  If you want it hotter, just add cayenne or chili powder along with the cumin.  This makes a great hot lunch.  Thanx!"
245787,102092,2007-05-19,5,i made this recipe a while ago! I was craving onion rings. These were really good!!!!! They were gone in no time! Will for sure make them again!
37449,266737,2007-12-10,5,A nice comforting drink that I enjoyed on a cold winter morning. Thanks Sally! Made for Zaar tag.
215350,78707,2011-01-16,5,"Excellent flavor! I was worried that only rosemary would not be enough seasoning, but it was perfect! The potatoes were delicious, the chicken was moist and flavorful. We added carrots and used flash frozen chicken breasts (I put the chicken in frozen-after being cleavered into several pieces- about 10 mins after the veggies). Everything took over an hour to cook through, partly because it was not a shallow pan I think. Awesome dish, will make again, and for company too!"
793663,177482,2008-03-26,5,"mmmmmm!!
easy and yummy!!! nuff said"
121684,29210,2004-04-16,5,"Oh my God, Sue, I think this may well be the best thing I've EVER tasted! Absolutely fabulous! I cooked it the first time for two as a trial run but I didn't halve the sauce which turned out to be a good idea. The only other change I made was substituting the dried chilli with 1/2 teaspoon crushed chilli (from a bottle).  I put 1/2 cup of cornflour in a bowl and jiggled the chicken cubes around in that with my tongs. Wasn't too difficult. My chicken didn't brown too well (maybe the oil wasn't hot enough) but it did crisp up beautifully so I won't worry too much about colour next time - the sauce covers it up anyway. 
If cooking for guests again, I'd deep fry the chicken in advance and put it aside ready for the second shallow frying. I'd have the sauce ready to go in a jug. I cooked it the second time for four and doubled the sauce, but found the chicken came out a bit soggy.  Next time I'd still double the sauce for 4 but I'll toss 1/2 the chicken in 1/2 the sauce, then do the other half. I made this for the 3rd time today.  Didn't have any peanut oil so I used vegetable oil and added a couple of drops of sesame oil.  It was just as good as the peanut oil and a whole lot cheaper!  I just LOVE this recipe!"
1163488,89063,2009-05-08,5,Made a double batch for a large group.  I used chocolate wafer cookies and put in food processor to make crumbs.  I think oreos would also work well.  The recipe is very easy and tastes great.  Can't wait to serve them to the group.
961714,31037,2008-11-29,5,Absolutely wonderful!  Easy to make & delicious to eat!  I've made this 2 times now and it always gets eat!  We even dip apple slices or banana's in it too!!
135566,369403,2009-09-14,4,"The directions don't say to brown the ground beef, but I did and drained off the fat before putting into the crockpot (used lean ground beef, but it was still fatty).  I also thought 6 hours was too long as my crockpot tends to cook hot even on the low setting, so I only cooked for 3 hours.  Served with these toppings: Kraft fat free shredded cheddar, reduced fat sour cream and chopped onions. Made for Fall 2009 Pick A Chef."
207176,90674,2008-08-24,5,My son had this at a friend's house and made me get the recipe!
28729,127689,2006-07-09,4,"This was very good. I too cut the liquid by half so as not to make it soupy. I used just a tad more cornstarch and it thickened up after I let it sit a bit. I would definately make this again. Thanks for the nice change of ""pasta"" pace.  "
949893,129926,2015-11-19,5,"Even my picky son loves them!!!!! used a whole rotesiere chicken,add cumin and chili powder.Layered the shells didnt roll.yummy!"
706608,118749,2010-08-08,4,"I can't believe how well these turned out! They're very close to the ones I've picked up at road stands in ""Dutch Country"".I WILL cut down on the brown sugar in the recipe next time though, just a little to sweet paired with the filling. I made my cookies bigger then stated and they were done at 10-12 minutes. And I added raisins to the dough as well. And PLEASE use this filling! The egg white is NOT going to hurt you, and though the filling initially seems a little thin and runny is stiffens after sitting for a little while! Thanks Grandma2669!"
69267,46509,2007-01-01,5,"This was so easy and the results were fantastic, even though I didn't have any lemon juice! My husband really enjoyed it. Thanks for a great recipe!"
182559,79308,2010-01-10,4,My family LOVES this chili!  Does not taste like turkey at all.  I did add a can of rotel and a can of green chilies....just to make it a little hotter.  I also serve this over baked sweet potatoes....YUMMMO!
284180,335545,2008-12-04,5,"Wow, this was so cheesy and delicious.  I left out the sundried tomatoes b/c we don't like them, and the artichokes b/c I thought I had some in the pantry but didn't.  But it was marvelous with the spinach, chicken, & bacon! I made my own dough - not sure if this was supposed to be a pre-baked crust.  I did NOT pre-bake the crust, and baked the topped pizzas at 425 for 11 minutes.  My crust recipe makes 2 small-to-medium-sized pizzas, so that's what I spread the toppings over, and it was just the right amount of everything - the sauce was spread a little thin, but that's OK because there was enough cheese to make it gooey.  I think this would've been too much topping for just 1 pizza (unless it was rather large) so I'm glad I made 2.  Oh, and this only served 4 for us, not 6; :)  Thanks for another cheesy winner, Jess!"
505967,80536,2010-01-30,5,"What a great stew! The hoisin sauce added an outstanding flavor. I threw about three times as many fresh herbs in, only cause I had to use em up and used the whole bottle of wine, and added beef broth to give time for the wine alcohol to cook off. Soooooo extremely good, especially with the cold weather we were having. Thanks very much!!!"
2002134542,500502,2018-04-29,4,"They were pretty good - fluffy enough that my husband didnât notice the difference - but I made a few significant modifications: I used 1 Tablespoon baking soda because other online sources said I needed to use 3x or 4x more soda to substitute for baking powder. (Mark Bittmanâs pancake recipe, which also has 2c flour, calls for 2t baking powder so I went with 1 Tablespoon, which was 2x.) I also used 1/4 cup yogurt instead of some of the milk, which other sources said was necessary. Next time I might try the full 3x baking soda, as they were a tad chewy. I always find the full two cups milk is necessary (or 1.75 cups and .25 cups yogurt)."
265694,283021,2008-02-23,4,this was soooo goooood!!!  the sun dried tomato pesto was awesome.  it really gave it a little kick. i will definitely make again. thank you. reviewed for RSC # 11
227230,11200,2011-01-28,0,"This was quite tasty; however, I would recommend adding some salt to the breadcrumbs or salt and pepper the cutlets prior to breading them."
224740,137390,2005-11-10,4,"Wow, what a soup :) I used black beans, black eyed beans and turkey sausage, and result was a good hearthy soup."
330505,131616,2009-01-11,4,"Very tasty and quick!  Liked the crunch of the water chestnuts and the little tiny bit of spice.  Next time I'll thin the sauce out a little more yet (I didn't use the whole 1/2 cup).  Thanks so much for posting this quick, easy, tasty meal.  Made for I Recommend Tag."
2549237,497470,2013-03-27,5,This was so simple and very flavorful.  I am lazy and hate cutting raw meat so I bought pre-sliced sirloin steak from the meat department and had my husband stand out in the snow and cook them on a charcoal grill.  These could easily become a frequent summertime meal for my family.  Thanks for another great recipe avalon!  Made for Spring 2013 PAC.
2324285,10191,2013-04-15,5,"Really good!  I never have maple syrup on hand, but felt like making pancakes for brunch.  I&#039;m glad I found this recipe, as your syrup tastes better than regular maple syrup.  I went with vanilla/cinnamon instead of maple flavoring, and loved it.  The coffee flavor is what really makes the syrup exceptional though- thanks for sharing."
289328,27144,2008-07-23,5,I made this for my father in laws 60th birthday....it was wonderful and everyone loved it!  We all agreed it is very rich but I will definately make again!!
368594,221743,2008-07-30,5,"This chicken was soooo moist and was so delish!!!! I'm giving you 10 stars for this one, KIT. The only thing i changed was i stuffed the inside with some chopped garlic, sliced onions and some scallions. It was a big hit. Thanks so much."
32058,45896,2006-12-17,5,This is the BEST Copycat of Honey baked ham I have tried.  It was MOIST!  The key for me I think was putting cut end down and basting often.  I doubled the sugar and honey glaze and used 1 cup of OJ (no pear juice to be found...)  I covered the ham with foil during the last 1/2 hour to prevent it from turning too dark on top.  EXCELLENT Recipe!  My new FAVORITE ham recipe.  Thank you!
222055,251345,2007-11-21,3,"I love the way this looks, but it really isn't much of a ""cheese ball"". When it finally dawned on me that I really didn't have a cheese ball, I had to run out and get everything to make one. I told everybody it was really just a centerpiece. When someone asked me if they could eat it, I said yes and watched them as they banged into the bowl with a confused look. Next time I will make a cheese ball and then use this whole idea and your pic to make the turkey. BTW, your turkey looked alot better than mine, so I will spare you the pic. Thanks for the whole idea carolinajewel!!!"
42844,31399,2004-02-02,5,"Very good.  I made these for Superbowl Sunday (Go Pats!) with some changes.  I doubled the recipe (had 20 shrooms), and used about 1/2 cup finely chopped onion in place of the instant minced onion, and used 2 cloves finely minced garlic in place of the garlic salt.  I also brushed the caps with olive oil, and added 1/3 cup grated parmesan to the stuffing mix.  They came out wonderfully."
2759170,35177,2013-03-29,5,"This recipe was delicious, very delicate perfect flavor.  Given the healthful way it is prepared I will definitely make it again.  I used weight watchers recipe builder to figure out that a serving is only 8 points.  Not bad at all!"
189616,36229,2008-02-23,4,"I didn't doctor up this recipe, made as written. The overall flavor was nice, though this froze solid hard, unlike regular icecream, and still after letting this sit for abit on the countertop, this had an icy texture, crunchy, crystalized(sp). I served this with an Indian Cuisine recipe#24139 and recipe#21855"
152178,175454,2006-12-29,5,"I made these once a long time ago for my sister. She recently mentioned how good they were. I couldn't find the original recipe, so I chose this one. I did omit the cinnamon because I didn't remember it in the original ones I made. I rolled them in powdered sugar while still warm and again after they had cooled off. These were so good and easy. I will bake these again. Thanks KittyKitty for a great recipe."
181696,69360,2005-12-21,3,I was a bit disappointed. They rose very little and thus were a bit heavy. Next time I think I would reduce the banana and subustitute some yogurt or sour cream. Otherwise they had a nice flavor
910660,79431,2008-08-10,5,Great comfort food for a cold night!
623545,26526,2007-10-22,5,"I have been looking for an easy, and good tasting white bread recipe for many years. This one is it! I have made 3 batches now, trying to perfect the rise and color. The family loves this bread and so do I. My next batch will be a variation to the flavor. Great taste, color, texture. Very easy to make. 
Note* I have made this with extra virgin olive oil and shortening. No preferences with either(same great taste and texture)."
98994,301002,2009-06-17,5,Simple and delicious! Had to make another batch the same night it went so fast. Cooked the liquid down a little with the shrimp to prevent it coming out soupy. Served with a garlic bread on the side.  Mmmmm...Will make again and again! Thanks for posting!
441087,91795,2007-01-30,5,i will DEFINITELY use this with my class (Gary Job Corps Culinary Arts).
740235,259509,2012-10-28,4,"Been trying some different recipes and taking them into work and there was some feedback that they were too sweet so opted for Granny Smiths - they worked out brilliantly. Also since most of my coworkers have a thing about leaving a cake or pie ""out"" I made them into individual portions using Reynolds baking cups. I'm not sure if it was because of the parsing out of the portions but to fill 24 cups I used one cup less apples and I needed to double the batter and streussel topping recipes. I cooked for the same amount of time and everything came out AWESOME!"
262129,112164,2006-10-26,5,"We are citrus ""Fanatic""s!  I thought the flavor was perfect.  Having so much celery and onion with less rice made the dish unique and very satisfying.  We used Jasmine rice (since the recipe called for long-grain white rice) but next time we will make it with brown rice.  We served curried salmon with this rice and all of the flavors held up nicely against the coconut and spices.  A+"
1679897,72398,2010-09-07,4,"Made this tonight using cream of brocolli soup and black beans instead of carrots and peas. I loved it. My 14 year old daughter wouldn't touch it. It had too many smells going on. Oh well, more for me!"
1607634,135350,2010-06-02,5,"This is delicious! The recipe was easily doubled. I found that I'd prefer it without adding breadcrumbs, or maybe with less, but that's just personal preference. Everybody loved it, and I will definitely be making this again!"
844554,180296,2013-02-01,4,I followed Boomette's review and used 6 tbs. of sugar only and 1/2 tsp salt. These were tasty muffins and moist to boot. Made for Rookie Tag Game 2013.
74652,59914,2003-10-01,5,Wow!  First of all my DH loves Olive Garden and especially loves the creamy sauce dishes from there.  He thought this was fabulous!  So do I!  Thanks :)
567219,130019,2008-12-03,4,"This was pretty good.  I made it just as the recipe reads but was disappointed with the sauce.  First I felt like there was not enough of it for 8 oz of noodles and secondly I felt like it needed some sweetness as well.  I ended up putting about a tablespoon of brown sugar along with some fish sauce we use for all of our other thai meals.  The end result was good, just not our very favorite thai dish."
202555,149012,2006-08-07,5,"I never know what to do with leftover baked beans. I fixed this for dinner last night and boy was it a hit! I simply added a couple of ingredients that weren't in my baked beans such as the beef and chilli sauce. Easy and enjoyed by all.
Thanks for sharing."
128473,436699,2011-12-13,5,"I used larger ribs and baked them in the oven, its too cold here to bbq right now. I marinaded them overnight, the ribs were incredible, we loved the flavor.  We dipped ours in the sauce, it made them hot, spicy and fresh tasting. Kudos on an excellent recipe that I will make again, can't wait to try these on the grill. Thanks for sharing AZPARZYCH."
41228,221558,2007-06-24,5,Yummy and filling! I skip the sugar and find the ice cubes unneccessary (when the bananas are frozen).  I also like to use canned pinapple (canned in pinapple juice). This is delicious!
169969,168047,2007-06-03,5,"Fabulous cookies with excellent texture. They are a bit sweet from the brown sugar, but sinfully good! I came out with 30 cookies. They do spread but they do not flatten and become crisp - so this is a keeper for me! Thanks dojemi!"
60989,60301,2003-06-17,5,"OH YUM!!! So easy, and so wonderful! I was kicking myself for not putting my chicken in my crockpot yesterday AM for my dinner guests. Then I found this, and am so happy I did! It was into the oven in under 5 minutes, and smelled wonderful by the time they arrived! Tasted even better!!!! They thought I slaved... dont tell. Thanks so much!"
278516,49200,2008-12-01,5,"Really great!
I made as stated other than using onion powder instead of garlic powder, because we didn't have any on hand, then I shook the potatoes in a plastic bag with all the ingredients together to make preparation even easier. :)
Thanks for sharing!"
366914,171171,2009-01-09,5,"Oh WOW! We loved this :-) because of the comments of some of the other reviewers I only used 2 slices of bacon, and I wasn't sure what type of wine to use but someone else commented on using a red so I used the only red I had.. Merlot. Mmm!! Definitely a do-over. I served this with mashed potatoes/parsnips (I mix them), and broccoli with a lemon/butter/white wine sauce. I forgot the sour cream :-( and plated up one plate.. but I poured the sauce back into the pan and added it then re-plated LOL. YAY!! Thank you!!"
102058,293438,2008-11-12,0,"I'm rating this without stars for the moment because DH 's wee dram before bed extended the bottle of Tullimore Dew that I thought I had hidden  away for recipes (er wrong, obviously not hidden nearly well enough!)  and I only had bearly 1/3 Cup left for this recipe. The ribs cooked up wonderfully  but I'm sure that the taste would have been even better with the other 2/3rds of the whisky in, so it's on the shopping list and I will review this better once I have made it again."
461887,295087,2009-01-03,5,This recipe turned out a  beautiful loaf of bread which also tasted as wonderful as it looked. Thanks for the recipe!
24995,43023,2003-02-07,4,"This was REALLY good. I made it as a side for Greek Chicken last night and enjoyed it. I think next time, and there will be a next time, I'll try using evaporated milk rather than regular. Just to see what happens. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks!"
241696,241958,2008-09-28,5,"I didn't have any Curacao and used 2/3 cup of brown sugar instead of the superfine, but it was very delicious.  The crepes were so light and good!  Since I wasn't adding the liquor, i added the orange rind in with the Orange juice.  I made the sauce and let it simmer while I made the crepes, so it was nice and syrupy...I made the crepes and then dipped into the sauce and folded them into quarters.  I then removed them from the sauce and put them on a platter for presentation...Thanks so much for a delicious recipe!  there are so many variations that can be made from this.  I will definately try the Curacao the next time kids aren't involved!  Thanks again!"
581006,118738,2012-10-21,4,"What a quick, delicious dessert! My family, who doesn't care for coconut, even enjoyed this. %u263A"
120121,55244,2004-07-02,5,"I have a recipe I've used for years.  Took a bite of these and thought I'd stick with my old recipe.  Took a second bite and decided...NOT!  The batter 'slid off' a little on the first batch, but I think it's because I didn't get the grease hot enough.  Once the temperature was adjusted properly, they fried up beautifully.  Wonderful recipe, just full of flavor!    "
160114,68955,2004-11-10,2,Was disappointed given all the great reviews.  The sauce never thickened enough and the vinegar was overpowering.  Would not make again.
91724,69244,2006-05-07,4,"I liked this soup better the day after making it, and the more I eat it, the more I like it. It is very unusual. I did add salt as well as veggie bouillon powder and I think it needed both. The color is beautiful. I found red bells on sale, otherwise I would never have tried this recipe since they're usually very pricey. If you have red bells growing in your garden, definitely give this a try. And the smoked paprika is a must. If you don't have it, don't bother. You can order it on line and it's so good in so many dishes. "
2345173,57961,2012-07-28,5,I have made this exact same recipe years ago.  I got the recipe from my son's sitter who was from East India.  It was the most delicious sweet confection I ever had! Thanks for posting this as I forgot how to make it.  I actually at the time (before internet came around) made them a little differently (accidently) by cooking it a bit longer than I should've which carmelized it more but still tasted great.  I'll have to experiement and try to make it again and post it that way as well :-)
133174,269686,2008-05-20,5,This is awesome!  The asparagus was crisp-tender and the fish was well seasoned.  I used Tilapia fillets and cooked this dish in my rice cooker/steamer.  The timing was right on target.  The fish was served on top of some leftover Recipe #299831 which added the finishing touch.  Something I will make again for sure.
292979,29318,2007-12-26,4,"This worked excellently.  It was a bit too salty for our taste, so I'll try if it still works as well with less salt next time.  The recipe was really useful - thanks for posting."
222478,366868,2009-10-25,5,"Yum! I used it to hot smoke some salmon in a small fish smoker and it came out a treat. I let it sit around 4 hours and it's an ideal recipe for any oily fish, the salt seemed to leech out some of the natural oil to the outside which let it cook in the natural juices leaving great moist flavour at the base while the top took up the smoke from the woodchips perfectly."
769890,63786,2010-08-18,4,I used beef and this is a decent solid recipe.
146047,19491,2009-07-23,5,"Loved these-- followed the recipe just for the banana muffin part (no nuts, chips), and used 1 c whole wheat flour with 1 c all-purpose flour. Thanks for posting!"
59144,22558,2004-07-09,5,"Emily, I have been on a bread baking frenzy and I happened across your recipe it is so Delicious and moist. I used Buttermilk instead of lowfat milk and I added 1/2 cup of sour cream. I topped it with a Struesal using brown sugar, cinnamon, and crushed pecan's. This recipe is to die for, thank you so much! I will use this recipe often and nextime I'll try Banana's or Zucinni. "
27443,349318,2009-01-25,5,"Just finished making and serving this wonderful pizza. Was considering making 2, but didn't, should have, everyone wanted more. Thanks for sharing."
768887,2772,2008-02-29,5,"WOW! This is the first time I've ever made pot roast, and I am glad to have found this recipe. I followed the instructions precisely and it was great!   I served this with egg noodles, and corn on the side.  Even the kids loved it. Thank you for sharing.  This one will be added on our bi-weekly plan."
124449,119795,2007-04-23,5,"I would give this more stars if I could! I omitted the capers and used more wine vinegar and less olive oil (personal preference). I also added some sliced green onions and garlic. Thanks for posting this, Mercy. It's a definite keeper!"
67270,214699,2007-03-16,5,"This is decadent; skip lunch so that you can properly indulge. And I think I agree that this is possibly the best penne a la vodka I've ever had (including my first taste, which was at Carmine's in NYC). I followed directions exactly, except at the end when I forgot the cheese till I'd added the sauce. I was surprised that the recipe called for mushrooms and not prosciutto (like my other two recipes), but it's very rich and certainly didn't need any meat. Thank you, mosma--this recipe is certainly worth a little extra time!"
220195,470127,2013-02-10,4,"I made this recipe as written in the magazine, and we loved it, but we knew we would, as we love anything that involves roasted grapes. Even the leftovers were delicious! The original recipe calls for considerably less vinegar, so add it according to your taste."
526666,366054,2009-12-03,5,"These were great with a minimal amount of work involved! I especially enjoyed the seasoning! I followed the recipe, as directed, but I sprinkled a bit of sea salt over them at the end of baking, as a personal preference! I will be sharing these with my friends over the holiday season, so thanks for sharing them with us, breezermom! :)"
174991,81861,2005-11-12,5,I used plain non-fat yogurt instead of buttermilk and marinated it overnight.  It is very moist.  It's a keeper.
291636,84892,2006-02-13,5,"This recipe is fantastic ! I cook maybe 15 minutes longer , they were bursting with flavor and i will make these very often  "
56181,27797,2002-11-19,5,"This is a very good recipe.  Very easy to make and yet it was impressive-in taste and in looks.  I will definitely be making this one again.  I didn't let the butter/herb mixture stand for 10-15 minutes and I left the biscuits whole to save on time.  It was still good and had plenty of flavor.  Thanks for posting!
"
727055,27893,2009-01-10,5,"Made this for my DH Christmas party at work and it was a hit, since there were no leftovers for me! Good thing I followed Julesong's  tip and made extra!  Thank you for sharing!"
41984,276887,2013-11-29,5,"I made this for Thanksgiving.  I was going to make muffins but was running short on time so I chose this recipe instead.  I&#039;m glad that I did!  I like the combination of apples, cranberries and walnuts.  The bread was easily put together and the end result was moist and flavorful.  Thank you for posting this recipe!"
895132,285811,2011-02-06,5,"These are fluffy and delicious indeed! I used tapioca for the starch and thinned coconut milk with some lemon juice for the buttermilk, and it worked extremely well. Great texture and taste, will make them again often! Thanks for sharing.<br/>Made for Healthy Choices ABC."
895132,444285,2011-10-31,5,"Amazing doesn't nearly describe this - it is plain wonderful. I used cocoa powder, almond butter and honey. As the cherries weren't specified, I used sour cherries which turned out perfect.<br/>Thanks for sharing this treat!<br/>Made for Think Pink 2011."
60646,63831,2005-09-22,5,"I made these, and then had to make a 2nd batch as my husband and kids liked them so much.  I added extra Wasabi since we like them with a kick.
Thanks for a great recipe!!
Chava"
489552,42071,2014-02-28,5,amazing soup
2000176787,495098,2015-04-30,5,WOW!!!  Delicious!!! I was worried about the calories..but I think this one muffin was enough for two servings!!!  Great with a spritz of lite whipped topping?!  YUMMY!!!
2000219675,17648,2015-05-23,5,"I made a modification (based ob another recipe that sound good but not quite there). 1/3-1/2 cup sour cream (I did not measure, used wbat was left in the container) plus one cup whole milk. Excellent recipe. I apologize Millie. I don&#039;t know how to follow a recipe any more! It turned out great though."
220433,152211,2011-08-21,4,Thanks for the recipe. I decided to skip the biscuits all together and used frozen egg noodles for the last hour and they turned out just fine.
64193,39631,2002-12-14,5,"Made this for my church Thanksgiving fellowship meal,and it was a hit! The whole thing was gone in 30 minutes! I love Heath bars so I added the bits in each layer rather than just for the topping. Very easy to make, and best when served as cold as possible. "
679953,205214,2013-04-29,5,"After 10 1/2 hours cooking time, this made for a very nice easy to cut, fall apart roast, nice and tender.  The beef broth, chili sauce together really made for a nice sauce.  Spicy, but not too spicy, that gave the roast a nice zing to it.  made for onegreat main dish for dinner.  Made for Holiday Tag."
107135,135530,2006-06-24,5,reminds me of irish soda bread thanks for posting dee
394592,35974,2007-03-04,5,These are great!! This was the first baking idea I tried off of Zaar and probably was a lot of the reason I wanted to join up and learn more. I first made these in late November and now it is Christmas Eve and I have made my umpteenth batch. Friends and family can't get enough. I tried honey roasted chunky peanut butter in the most recent batches and found it to be a nice variation. You really can't mess this one up- a winner of a recipe- Thanks for sharing!!
246344,310341,2010-05-16,5,"I've been making this for a couple of years (although I just had it to look again because MyCookbook lost a bunch if its links) and it's amazing! We love it over white rice with some naan on the side. (Yes, I know it's not Indian, but it really works well with naan!)"
228458,483025,2012-08-18,4,"I LOVE the flavor of these. I often make oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, but it never dawned on me to add cinnamon. To amp the flavor up a bit I used a combination of chocolate chips and cinnamon chips, which was really delish. My cookies spread quite a bit, though, which made for a crispier cookie than I had hoped for. This was quite possibly due to user error! I will still highly recommend the recipe and will definitely give them another shot soon! Made for ZWT 8: The Wild Bunch."
522643,204548,2009-10-17,5,This bread was so soft and very forgiving!  I made them for cheesesteaks and  I wound up rising it a few times because the rolls were going to be way too big so I kneaded it again and then let them rise.  SO soft - I don't know how another could have used it for pizza crust as it is very soft.  Will make again and again!
323186,341997,2013-09-11,5,"Very easy and very good, I do love roasted peppers!   I used chorizo, this made a richly flavoursome sauce,  to which I added a touch of sugar, personal taste.   Thanks for sharing, made for I Recommend tag game"
114681,134729,2007-07-19,4,"My sugar shorts went CRAZY over these!  I made it em, threw them in a container (had to use up some fresh frozen blackberries), didn't think much about them and WHAM.  These guys were GONE.  I only made half the recipe, won't make that mistake again.  the only kind of mistake I did make was to try to get them out of the tin a little too quickly.  They will stick but do pop right out once cooled.  I have to do em again!  Thanks Oregano."
376098,191177,2008-11-01,5,The flavor of these is dead on!  They were enjoyed very much by my family.  Thank you.
1302118,114360,2009-06-21,3,"Calls for WAY too much cream.  I would say use 6-7 cups MAX, instead of 8.  Also, recipe is too heavy on the butter.  Mine ended up very oily...Takes at least an hour to reduce the cream to half, and tack on another hour or so for the rest of the cooking.  Overall, a very expensive recipe with somewhat disappointing results.  I suggest adding in some tomato paste or something of the like for more flavor...I will not make this again."
65502,366313,2009-08-26,4,"The taste of this is terrific. I made it as listed except for (there's always an exception!) I used more pasta - linguine, and a handful of fresh shrimp added at step 4. I would recommend using twice the amount of pasta to feed 4 people. Delicious!! Made for PRMR. Thanks! :)"
208196,114756,2007-04-10,5,I made this with some shimeji mushrooms and it turned out wonderfully.  Perfect side dish for a bento box.
170271,70923,2012-02-28,3,"made these this morning.  they are good but not great.  mine turned out a bit oily for some reason.  i followed the recipe and only used real butter, real vanilla etc.  the flavor is slight, not bad in any way, just wish they had more vanilla flavor.  maybe next time i'll experiment with vanilla bean.  this is a good base recipe."
286566,470468,2012-01-26,5,"Went to make these wonderful little easy morsels only to discover all the ham had been finished so just put some diced hot pepperoni on top of the egg and then topped with cheese bunged it in the oven for 15 minutes and voila breakfast.  My eggs were firmed set all the way through which suited the DM beautifully so when making again will cut the time back to 10 or 12 minutes to have a slightly runny yolk which is what I like unless planning on having them cold then would cook for the 15 minutes.  Thank you Dienia B, made for 123 Hits tag game."
573325,275793,2012-10-12,5,"This sandwich is so yummy! My sis and me enjoyed the spread a lot on a white roll (Im sure whole wheat would have been great, too, though). The carrot goes great with the pb and dried fruit (I used craisins). The sunflower seeds add a nice crunch and earthy note. I didnt have enough pb on hand so I added some plain yogurt to get a creamy consistency and still the taste was very intense.<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this recipe with us, Ana! <br/>Made and reviewed for one of my PAC babies October 2012."
504753,187508,2009-04-27,5,"Thank you for this recipe, I think I have been waiting for it all of my life.  Bacon and sausage are the only forms of pork I will eat, and I've wanted a good Bangers and Mash recipe for almost forever.  I also love Toad in the Hole.  Thanks again.........bb"
220433,44263,2014-03-13,5,"Wow, just Wow. These are super yummy. I want to try adding some things. Bacon Crumbles using some of the Bacon fat to replace the oil, Chopped Pecans, Cranberries... Thanks for a keeper."
39835,16562,2004-08-27,5,"Delicious, fun-to-eat and easy-to-make -- what more can you ask for. We had this with tortilla chips and ice cream sandwiches using paper plates for almost no clean up! The chili sauce is also perfect for dipping tortilla chips. Thanks Mirj for sharing!"
37779,36066,2004-01-26,5,"My family loves meatballs, especially my kids. We all thought these had excellent flavor and a great tender texture. I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce and let them warm in the crock-pot all afternoon. Dinner was a breeze and the kids were tickled pink the we were having meatballs for supper. Thanks CG. "
23119,149233,2009-09-01,5,"This was a very good pie. It reminded me of my mother's when she used to bake when I was a littel girl. This will be made again, it was such an easy pie to do. Made for Bargain Basement."
307214,151061,2007-01-29,5,MMMMMM!  Really good.  I was looking for a crunchy topping for yogurt and this works great and its healthy too. Thanks.
461724,53914,2007-12-09,3,"I liked these, but the rest of the family weren't that crazy about them."
98170,161980,2011-09-10,5,Spot on wonderful!
679953,397163,2014-11-10,5,"Great little snack for us this afternoon.  Great banana flavor, and worked well with the peanut mixture.  Drizzled a real small amount of chocolate syrup on the top.  YUMMY."
914720,34382,2009-09-22,5,"These were amazing!  We loved the flavor, and I loved that I didn't have to peel the potatoes.  Served as a side dish to recipe#286594 -- will become a frequently used recipe at our house.  Thanks for sharing!"
126440,47111,2009-10-10,5,"Excellent flavor and easy to do.
I did mine on manual and then baked at 375 deg. for 28 min.  My crust was a bit dark so would reduce the temp. a little. Going to use for French toast tomorrow as suggested.  BTW I used 1 1/2 t. cinnamon and pre-soaked the raisins."
2001093314,292770,2016-07-18,5,"My co-workers at the hotel are largely from El Salvador. For a combined lunch, I volunteered to bring rice, and, after looking @ Spanish Rice and Mexican Rice recipes, wondered if there was El Salvadoran Rice. Found this recipe and made it. Thumbs up from the co-workers! A few things: (1) Yes, add a little minced jalape&ntilde;os to taste. (2) I used boxed chicken broth since I had some on hand, instead of the water and bouillon. (3) When you're chopping/mincing the veggies, double-up and put the extras all together in a baggie or whatever. Then when you make the next batch, easy-peasy to get everything cooking. If you/family like it as much as I did, that will be soon! (4) Second batch, I didn't have any more fresh Roma tomatoes, so I put in about one tomato's worth from a can of tomato/chilies, saving the rest for, again, next batch. And squeeze out the liquid with the cut-off lid to include in the amount of liquid used. I'm eating this second batch for my off-day lunch -- doesn't even need meat, although chunked cooked meat of any kind could easily be added. Thanks for having this recipe available!!"
552864,363149,2009-08-08,5,"We had this for dinner tonight and it was really yummy.  It went together very quickly but tasted like I had spent a lot of time preparing dinner.  My favorite kind of dinner - easy, quick and delicious!  I served this with fresh steamed broccoli and buttermilk mashed potatoes...think we'll probably have this again next week **can't wait**  Thank you for sharing."
198393,36411,2006-01-15,4,"I'd leave out the hazelnuts -- and cut the entire recipe in half -- but that's all.  This cake is very, very dense, not too spicy or sweet but incredibly rich, it's everything Christmas cake should be.  My family was quite satisfied, after three weeks of agitating to cut the cakes early.  On the other hand, it took a whole lot of time and dinero just to get the ingredients together.  If you're seriously into fruitcake, go for it."
1198257,105670,2009-09-21,5,These are great-I soaked the toothpicks and grilled the poppers - you have to keep an eye out so you don't lose all the cheese but it worked out well!
863055,15345,2009-12-23,5,"Awesome cookies. Used butterscotch chips to make ""oatmeal scotchies"" and get rave reviews everywhere I take them. Sweet but not too sweet and addictive!"
815198,48589,2009-01-21,5,This was awesome!! I did add a 1 tsp. cumin and 1/4 tsp. red pepper to mine as I did not put in salt due to diet restrictions. I also cooked the potatoes in water instead of oil and it worked perfectly and helped lower the fat and calories. Very good recipe!!
1168148,123803,2009-04-24,5,Loved these wraps!!I heated the tortillas in a microwave instead of the oven.Divided the recipe in two and used ceaser dressing instead of ranch dressing.
237951,140559,2007-12-11,5,"I've tried very similar white chili recipes before, but for me, this is the best.  The sour cream and whipping cream really made a big difference."
1925885,401913,2012-08-15,5,"Made and reviewed for ZWT8 - Great Britain. Our favorite restaurant has a ""drink of the week"" and cucumber/gin seems to be a favorite.  Hadn't had a chance to try it, so this was the ONE.  YUMMY!!!  There's something about the cucumber that gives it a texture and taste that you can't quite put your finger on.  All I can say is I'm a happy camper going into the dinner hour!!!  Thanks for another great recipe, Kate!"
791558,128566,2008-11-30,5,"Absolutely amazing, I didn't have leftovers when I made this one. Really easy to make."
653438,326468,2012-06-12,5,Made as written except for adding a little regular onion along with the green onions (we love onion).  Very easy and quite good for a quick fresh salsa.  Thank you for posting.  Made for My 3 Chefs June 2012.
91584,364677,2012-11-13,5,Very very yummy! Great with a cup of tea :)
226066,95416,2008-04-27,5,Used this icing to decorate Marg's recipe #2496.  Used half-salted butter only and didn't add any salt.  This is sweet and had no problems at all icing my cake with it!  Thanks Marg! :)
65502,300847,2009-04-29,5,I liked this casserole. It's quite healthy with all of the carrots and I cut the butter in half and used low fat mozza. A nice recipe to use as a side dish - it has the starch and the veggies. There was enough for about 6 of us. Thanks!
382071,183592,2007-02-05,4,This is a very nice thick and hearty soup. I loved the bacon in it! I used more bacon than called for but not as much grease. I used brown lentils. I added 2 cups of water with 3 chicken bouillion cubes at the end as it was too thick. I added 1/2 tsp black pepper and that was too much (my mistake). I really enjoyed this with the parmesan cheese. Made for Zaar tag.
199902,98985,2006-06-19,5,"These were so easy to make and they turned out SOOOO delicious.  I really liked the crumb topping, tasted like a muffin right out of the bakery!  I used fresh blueberries and followed the directions exactly.  I'll never use a mix again!  Thanks KC Cooker."
176591,74048,2004-12-24,3,I was disappointed with this recipe because it was so peanut-buttery (and I do like peanut butter!)  I was hoping it would be more chocolate-y.
599377,215414,2008-11-26,4,"Just made this dish last night, and the flavor was excellent, but I also had a problem with the potatoes still being raw in places.  Yes, they were sliced thin, and I baked this for an hour and a half at slightly more than the 350 degree called for.  Next time I'll zap the potatoes first."
299220,151187,2006-03-06,5,"This is the absolute best recipe. I loved it, my hubby loved, even my kids loved it. We had it with Jen T's mustard sauce and that was fabulous too. So easy to make, so easy to eat!!
Thanks so much."
426408,54257,2010-02-27,5,"This meatloaf clearly doesn't need yet another great review, but I cannot just sit by and let it slide.  This recipe is so good!  Really!  I love my moms meatloaf, but this one is better.  I make it with venison, and it turns out perfectly every single time.  We have this at least once a month.  When we're in doubt of what to have for dinner, this is our go to meal.  Delicious!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe."
63475,177342,2007-01-22,5,"This is a very good salad.  I left out the yellow peppers because I did not care for them.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe and it was great.  Thanks for posting"
29177,27208,2002-06-12,4,My family really enjoyed this roast! I used less Ranch dressing like you suggested - Perfect! Thanks! :)
2000494236,30818,2017-05-18,0,Frozen meatballs r a no go for me
169430,393768,2010-03-13,5,"The 5 stars were all bestowed by the 3 guys who sampled that cake. They all gave that rating on the taste which can't be a bad thing. I have to add that I followed the recipe and took it out  at 45 mins when the tester was clean. While it apparently have outstanding flavor the bottom layer was very heavy  and dense near the bottom. Aside from cutting the recipe back to 10 servings (with guys? as if!) and using an 8x8 pan this was made as directed. Since it was such a hit I'll likely make it again and see if I still get the dense moist bottom of if today was an anomaly, I hope it was."
686550,3743,2008-01-03,4,"I have been looking for an alternative to a cream soup base that I purchase from a restaurant supply.  It is very good, but expensive.

This recipe is different from that soup base, but still good.  It was way too salty for me. I reduced the chicken bouillon by 1/2 and this helped.  I may eliminate it alltogether for more of a generic base.

This is a great recipe to start with, and adjusts easily to suit your taste.  Kudos!"
65056,89264,2005-09-19,5,"I made this last night, and it was so good that I made it again tonight.  It has a wonderful thick, creamy mouthfeel and the subtle flavor of the anise is so soothing.  I strained mine in my French press, which made this very easy.  I did have some of the problems that the others did with the milk cooking down so that it doesn't make a full cup at the end, but it wasn't a big difference.  Wonderful!"
80079,51295,2003-09-09,5,"Another keeper, Meanie!  DH and I both loved it.  DD2 loved it once I made her one with/out the chili paste (how can this be my child?) It was quick, easy and extremely flavorful.  My mind is already think of other things I can do with these ingredients!"
1196631,140738,2010-06-19,5,"i actually didn't get the recipe from here i found it in an old Betty crocker magazine, i was going to post it if no one else had but i'm surprised to see its up here with no reviews!!! i made them for my dad for fathers day and they were WONDERFUL! and surprisingly simple! the only advice i have is you might want to add an extra egg or a bit more peanut butter if the dough turns out a bit dry (as it did for me when i fallowed the recipe) and two it may take a bit longer in the oven, took mine about 11 or 12 minutes. other then that they are perfect! a great gift for any one! ^_^"
771965,25628,2009-08-28,4,This was good but I used sugar substitute which gave it such a heavy molasses flavor.Loved the consistency though at first it was really runny but after letting it get cold it turned out just right.Will try again thanks.
45807217,368097,2014-09-22,5,"This is a great recipe!  I doubled it and increased the worcestershire sauce to 1/4 cup, used fresh garlic and added an extra habanero.  I also canned this to have it keep a little longer!  Doubling gave me 3 16 oz ball jars.  We had this on chicken wings right away and the sauce did not drip off in the grill but clung to the wings.  I am not a huge fan of wings but this sauce has changed my mind.  Yum!"
541955,266209,2009-02-16,5,"Utterly delish! The flavourings were very subtle and quite beautiful. 

Cooked this for friends doing weight watchers and everyone had seconds, saying they were the best meatballs theyÃ¢â¬â¢d ever had- no one could believe they were also so healthy. BIG thank you! We are having this again this week.

I cooked these dipped in egg, rolled in whole wheat breadcrumbs and baked in the oven at 325F for 25 mins. Which helped Ã¢â¬ÅhealthyÃ¢â¬ï¿½ it up a lot!

We ate this served with whole wheat spaghetti, fresh tomato marinara sauce, and salad."
680724,296028,2008-11-16,4,"I really enjoyed this. It was quick, easy, and did not require a lot of cleanup. 

I added 1 can of diced tomatoes while the shrimp simmered (and because of the tomatoes, I added an extra TBSP of hot pepper paste) and I served it over yellow rice. It reminds us of an Italian dish I make called Shrimp Fra Diavolo (served w/ spaghetti). My hubby requests that I serve it over pasta next time, so I will."
418915,222156,2007-07-08,4,"This was a nice flavorful salad that the whole family enjoyed.  Like the other reviewers, I found that 3 T. of olive oil was plenty.  In addition, I think it would be better if the pine nuts were toasted to bring out more flavor."
537937,333849,2008-12-11,5,"This is such a quick and easy recipe for bisquits and gravy.  I have made recipes like this similar, but  never this easy.  I did make my bisquits using Bisquick baking mix as I didn't have any refriegerated biscuits available.  I""ll be using this recipe from now on instead of my own which has lots more steps and ingredients.  Same outcome and taste!~
Thanks Breezer....made for Holiday Tag~"
2001901100,81852,2017-12-30,5,Made it per your directions and it's beautiful! And delicious
865936,370765,2009-05-14,4,"This is a nice change of pace for preparing sweet potatoes.  The potatoes themselves are sweet and the dipping sauce is quite tart.  This recipe makes far more sauce than you will need, so either make less or try to think of something else it will go well with.  Maybe fruit.  Be careful not to use too much oil on the potatoes or they will burn in the oven.  I turned them halfway through cooking.  I used horseradish mustard because I thought it was as near as I could get to Australian mustard according to my research.  Made for ZWT5.  Thanks for posting, g'day mate!"
26095,11233,2002-04-27,5,This is great with the Mexican Velveeta cheese also.  You can even leave out the Tobassco using this cheese.
2001513850,151029,2017-04-30,5,"I've done this one several times now. Three can fulls of milk and one of water seems to be the sweet spot for me. It's definitely missing something if you go all water. I didn't find that the bacon or cheese added much, but the spices are well balanced and fun to play with from batch to batch. It's perfect for dipping a grilled cheese in and then drinking up afterward. My wife and I prefer this to store-bought by a large margin and honestly it's not any harder than heating it up from a can."
5060,34612,2002-07-25,5,"These potatoes were excellent, kinda like a hot potato salad,  the cumin was a nice touch and went well with the garlic and chives.  I'm going to try it again as a cold potato salad, I think it will be equally as good!!  Thanks for another keeper Bergy!!"
1657616,350621,2013-02-19,5,"I never found snow peas, so instead I used a small bag of frozen veggies and added some red crushed pepper flakes. I was spicy delicious! I also used the sirrachi hot sauce since I did not find the peanut sauce. Thanks KC_Cooker!"
326902,81047,2007-05-17,5,"I made this soup for my mom and her friends on MotherÃ¢â¬â¢s day.  It came out very good. It is healthy, tasty and also looks good. Everyone loved it."
649173,86307,2008-11-06,5,"I halved the recipe, added a bit of Old Bay seasoning (my dh loves it) and threw in 1/2 dozen shrimp, because I love shrimp. It was superb! Served it with angel hair pasta and sugar peas. A meal to remember. Thanks so much for posting this keeper!
PS:  I did add the cayenne.  Maybe more than a dash. . ."
1407403,14873,2014-06-25,5,"This is incredibly good.  I used homemade pizza dough, homemade ranch dressing with the Neufchatel cheese and sour cream, and added red onion and spinach leaves.  I cooked it on 500 for 5 minutes, reduced the temp to 425 and cooked it for 15 minutes and left it on the stone for a while longer after I took it out of the oven. (to increase &#039;crispiness.&#039; Delicious pizza.  I&#039;ll make this again.  Thank you for the recipe!  This is the recipe I used for my crust.  I mix it in the food processor until elastic and do not knead.  Easy Peasy!  http://low-cholesterol.food.com/recipe/pizza-dough-for-thin-crust-pizza-70165"
229619,441862,2013-03-17,5,"I think this is my new favorite way to cook cabbage, and the balsamic just adds an extra layer of yummy goodness."
288146,34881,2012-01-05,5,Awesome!  I was actually (pleasantly) surprised at just how much flavor this simple dish has. I subbed a can of diced tomatoes for the fresh but otherwise kept the same.  I will definitely make this dish again.  Thanks for posting!
223979,224040,2009-11-20,5,Easy and delicious!  I used halibut fillets.  I served this with a nice tossed salad for a light dinner.  Made for Aussie Swap.
823814,165638,2011-01-16,0,"Pretty tasty soup. Vietnamese soups def are some of my favorites. I addd both beef broth and beef stock. I also added about 1.5"" of diced up fresh ginger and an extra stock of lemon grass. I didn't have any lime, so next time I may add that. Also, I added rice stick noodles instead of flat rice noodles since they were the only ones I had. I added probably 2-3 tablespoons of Sriracha hot sauce too. I added probably 1-2 tbsp of Hoisin sauce to the broth while it simmers."
1762637,314175,2011-02-22,5,"All I can say is ""WOW""!!"
229787,83022,2007-09-16,5,"These were amazing! They really were close to the originals! Not as spicy, but that's OK! I will be making these again!!"
239758,267863,2011-01-04,5,"Oh wow, what a fantastic potato dish. I made it for one -- for lunch today -- and it was perfect! I used one potato, 1/2 of a small onion, 1 tablespoon fresh basil, 1 clove of garlic, the juice of half a lemon and 1/4 of the other ingredients. This is so easy to make. Thanks so much for posting your experiment."
223854,222948,2007-05-01,4,The only changes I made I used snow peas instead of mange-touts peas and added less red chillies as Little Miss (DD) was eating the stir-fry. In fact if you're not a chilli fan you could leave it out all together. Very yummy and healthy stir fry. Thank you Aaliyah's Mum
632052,336205,2010-03-21,5,Another great recipe by Kittencal.  I was looking for something to serve company that would be easy since I had to work during the day as well.  This did not disappoint at all everyone loved it and of course the women asked for the recipe.  I used a 4 lb. roast and doubled the sauce and it worked out great.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.
10113,68940,2004-04-16,5,"this was so good,made this last night for supper,i did add some left over ham,cause i needed to get rid of it.this is real comfort food"
976836,47249,2008-11-24,5,I am very picky about the taste of my Ranch dressing and this is wonderful.  I agree with the previous poster about it being just a little too salty but that is easily adjusted.  Thanks so much for posting it!
98919,267501,2015-09-21,5,"I think mine came out perfect as far as getting the right crunch. I had trouble getting it less than a 1/4&quot; so baked it a little longer. Had trouble getting my rolling pin in the pan to roll, so I used a large vitamin bottle with the parchment under it. Worked just fine. It will be nice for something to snack on when I feel the urge for something with some crunch to it. UPDATE: Changing my review to 5 stars. The more I ate them the better I liked them and my husband loves them. He wants me to make weekly to snack on during work hours. I put the silicone mat on my countertop and rolled the 2nd batch really thin with no problems using a rolling pin. Then just picked it up and moved to the baking sheet."
160977,179776,2006-08-05,5,"Hubby asked: ""Is five stars the most you can give?"" This was just great. At first I thought that the flour wouldn't ""melt"" in but when it started boiling it blended just fine. Boiled it for exactly 10 minutes and then it was still runny. Decided NOT to boil it for longer which was a good decision. When it had cooled down it took on the thickness of a spread.
The next day I baked a round plain white cake, let it cool and divided it. Spread about two tablespoons of the lemon spread in between. Heavenly! Divided the rest of the spread in three and froze it. Couple of days later I took out one portion and used it on toast. So happy to have found this. Thanks for sharing."
68960,61946,2004-02-03,5,Loved the flavour the  parmesan gave the patties and the sauce is just fantastic.  Another favourite for Hubby.  Even my 2yo loved the patties.
1644419,194265,2010-07-01,5,"YUMMMMMY! !  I did, however, omit the nuts.  They do not seem to agree with us old folks, they tend to get stuck under our dentures & that hurts.  Otherwise the pie is very good."
88099,466838,2012-04-08,5,Excellent.  The flavor combingation was perfect for us and the cooking time was right on.  I used 12 oz of shrimp but used all the other ingredients as listed.  Added a little extra lemon when serving.  DH also used cocktail sauce that he spiced up with horseradish.  We will for sure make this again and again as we love shrimp.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for PAC Spring 2012
117396,68084,2004-05-08,4,"The taste was marvelous!  The only change I will make next time is to lightly dust the chicken with flour before placing in the pan so it will thicken the juice from the chicken.  Maybe it was extra juicy because I only had 1% milk.  The cherry tomatoes were a great surprise to the mouth and enhanced the flavor of the cheese mixture.  Good one, Marie. "
137302,421740,2012-04-20,5,This is a light as a feather pound cake.  It is the lightest in texture pound cake I have ever tasted.  I didn't have any lemon extract so used the 'real thing' instead.  (zest from one lemon and equivalent teaspoons of fresh lemon juice instead).   We really like the taste of lemon glaze over our lemon cakes...but for those who prefer not...this is a nice alternative.  Made for PAC Spring 2012.
2001635836,530478,2018-09-04,5,Made these for a dinner party. Everyone loved them and easy to make.
360437,200820,2007-03-31,5,These were great! Very simple preperation and restaurant quality results! I used whole wheat pitas and roma tomatoes. I don't recommend leaving out any of the ingredients listed. Thank you!
222139,166730,2006-06-13,5,We liked this. It had a unique flavor of its own.   Quite easy to make. I cut back the cooking time to 50 minutes.  
1553016,19507,2010-02-15,5,"Excellent! The whole family raves about these. We like a touch of lemon with our blueberries, so I added the juice and grated rind of one lemon. The recipe makes a big batch which is great for pulling out of the freezer for busy weeks when there is no time for baking. Thanks for sharing. This is THE only blueberry muffin we will be making from now on."
95743,153712,2008-02-27,5,"Made 1/2 recipe for the two of us and we had no trouble polishing it off with some sliced hard boiled eggs.  Used fresh spinach and whole wheat bread crumbs.  I used far less oil than called for and only one hour chill time since I forgot I needed any until it was too late.  Dh is still convinced it had sausage in it.  I'm not telling him any differently. Excellent recipe, Kitten."
1032748,142232,2008-11-18,5,Ah! It was delicious...I doubled the recipe and made it for study break for my dorm house (I'm a college student). It was gone within seconds and I got numerous compliments on it.
268058,191369,2006-11-13,5,"Made this for a bridal shower this weekend. It was a hit. I made it in  a bundt pan and realized I was out of raisins so used craisins instead. No orange zest- used a T of orange marmalade. Mom will love this- have to make again when everyone is here for Turkey day !
Thanks for posting!!"
21487,43336,2002-12-26,5,Let alone does this taste wonderful it was indeed a good suggestion for a gift. Thanks Di!
2732408,57250,2015-03-08,5,"We love this recipe! They are a great treat, and easier than making choc. chip cookies.  I love how buttery they are, and just enough choc in every bite.  you could add 1/4-1/3 cup more choc. chip if a big choc. fan!  This recipe is very specific and I follow it exactly, unlike the rest of my cooking!"
1371589,86891,2013-09-23,5,"I used veggies that I had, great flavor for sauce, will make this many more times! Thanks"
452940,182174,2011-04-22,5,"Loved em! I didn't separate the eggs, just threw everything in a bowl, stirred well, and served with a dollop of sour cream. I will definitely be making these again, YUM!"
298801,148881,2007-08-14,5,"This was a great dish, we had it for dinner. After reading the reviews, I did add an extra egg for the added height. This was so good, there was none left! So much for breakfast the next morning, LOL! I did use pie crust instead of the creasent rolls. I think both would be good so next time I will try the cresent rolls. I did have to bake longer but I think this might be due to the extra egg and the oven variances."
1608359,68711,2010-05-02,5,"Love this recipe!  I had trouble stirring the dough, though, so now I let my food processor do the work.  Grind the almonds, dump in the dry ingrediates, then pour in the wet, processing until the dough is crumbly.  I add raw almonds last and briefly process again to chop a few of them  I take handfuls of the crumbly dough and press it into logs on a prepared baking sheet - works really well and is EASY.  Try these with cinnamon tea.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!"
850974,102274,2009-01-04,5,"Very good. I always find it's far better the next day and freezes very well. A note to those who don't have a food processor: I put the rinsed black beans in a large bowl with 1.5 cups of the broth and use a potato masher to smash the beans until they reach the consistency I like them to be. It's quick, don't worry. Also, I only use 3 cups of broth total as I like thicker soups. I omit the celery and compensate with bell pepper and carrot. Also, I don't have any other use for hickory liquid smoke so instead I throw in a nice big dash of good smoked paprika. Make this every other week. And vegan too! Thanks for the simple yet tasty recipe Little Bee!"
632249,310472,2014-05-09,5,What a great little recipe this is!  I cut the recipe in half for DH and I and added a sprinkle of dill. We loved it! I served it over pasta.  Made for Spring PAC 2014. Thanks for sharing!
125766,91827,2006-03-31,5,"I had been looking for my recipe I lost and I think this is pretty close, if not better then the one I used to use. I let it rise then roll out to fit a large round cake pan. 12 inch pans. I am able to make two nice pizzas using these pans I just lay a cookie sheet over them and let them rise with oven light on in oven. I also sometimes stuff the crust with cheesesticks cut in half and push into the crust. (I loved it  because I am a sucker for stuffed crust pizza)
This is a keeper!! Family pizza night fav. here :)"
4439,294777,2008-03-29,5,"i love you for posting this recipe. i have made it twice before and LOVED IT but have been too lazy to post it. it is delicious and unique and everyone who has tasted it loved it too. i use a Pillsbury crust too, i told you i was lazy. it tastes like an ultimate wonderful Cuban sandwich and more. thank you for posting this. anyone who tries it will love it too."
1362457,173875,2013-01-11,5,This is one of my GO TO easy and delicious summer salads when the tomatoes are perfection. I sometimes add cucumber and/or red onion if I have it around. It's similar to a caprese salad taste but it feels lower maintenance. A must try!
135441,88238,2004-04-22,5,Loved it!I put two cups of blueberries and I also made a blueberry sauce to serve over it.
848507,149510,2009-09-27,5,"Excellent recipe. Thank you so much for sharing.

I had red chili sauce already prepared and had used this recipe: http://www.recipezaar.com/Red-Chili-Sauce-314038

I keep that sauce, as a base for many recipes as it saves me time.

I prefer a very smooth sauce so I pureed the tomato (diced) with the chicken stock (I use better than boullion stock base).

This really is a lovely sauce no matter how you how you alter the preparation.

Thank you so much for sharing!"
2001984129,20870,2018-02-10,0,Easy recipe! I also baked them for 12 min. They are a light cookie not heavy. Will make again! Thank you for recipe! And 70 calories tops it off! yay!
1623265,28398,2014-01-23,0,I didn&#039;t care for it but that isn&#039;t a recipe thing. That&#039;s a me thing.  Everybody in the house liked it.
284180,334234,2008-11-16,3,"This was not really to my family's taste.  The flavors all worked well together, so I really wanted to like it more.  But we didn't like some of the textures.  The nuts and apples were too crunchy, and there was so much milk it was soupy.  (I had planned to add the whole amount, but stopped after pouring on about half, and it was still very soupy).    We would have enjoyed this more if the apples had been somewhat cooked, and if the almond flavor was only from the milk instead of the toasted nuts. Thanks for posting; it was interesting to try something flavorful & new this morning."
478964,230006,2013-04-23,5,"These are great.  I make them twice a year for a 95 year old Irish Priest I know and he LOVES them, so do I!  They do need to be refrigerated to shape easy.  THANKS&lt;br/&gt;&#039;"
254805,22421,2006-07-22,5,"This was a wonderful chocolate-filled pie! I had never had a chess pie of any kind and I loved this! It was super easy to make using Marie's Easy As Pie No Roll Pie Crust  Recipe #93312. I wasn't sure if the butter was supposed to be softened or melted so I just softened it and mixed it in. Turned out fine, hope that was right! :-) Topping this with fresh sweetened whipped cream is a must, so yummy! I'll definetly be making this whenever I need a chocolate cream pie fix, it's just as good and half the work!"
527886,125197,2008-10-29,4,"Very nice! The proportions are fairly flexible. We usually include more garlic, and a bit of a hot pepper. With a little bit of planning, you can roast these veggies while you have the oven on for something else.

The recipe amount is a little more olive oil than I need for the amount of vegetables. Two or 3 tablespoons is sufficient."
597743,39087,2008-01-10,5,"Excellent!  I added more sun-dried tomatoes than what the recipe calls for because of their wonderful flavor... I think that really added to the dish.  I used a pint of heavy cream and let it simmer/reduce and it turned out perfectly.  Next time I will consider using shrimp instead of the chicken.  Great recipe, will make again -- thanks!"
383346,178156,2008-01-05,4,"I used Jose Cuervo gold tequila.  Grand Marnier like Cheryl suggested.  If I do it again, I think I'll cut back on the lime juice.  Very potent and I liked it.  Thanks Lazyme :)  Made for Zaar Star Game."
212609,354808,2009-02-15,5,"Simple and delicious.We loved these skins.They were the perfect vehicle for scooping up dips,although I bet they would be great loaded too!
A great recipe,with such versatility.Thanks Sharon.
Made for Newest ZaarTag."
869184,375775,2009-07-11,5,Oh my! Was this ever good! We devoured the dish along with steak. The flavours are fresh and the colours beautiful together. I squeezed some lemon over the avocados after dicing and it seemed to do the trick. They were still green after 3 hours in the fridge. I only omitted the olives (we are not olive fans). We will definitely make this again. Made for 1-2-3 hits
160497,28927,2007-08-14,5,"This is the first meatloaf recipe that my family absolutely cleans up!  Tasty and easy to make!  Smells great while it's cooking, too.  I used 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. ground turkey, I'm going to try 2 lbs. ground turkey next time.  Thanks for our new meatloaf recipe!"
356127,227630,2007-05-12,5,"Excellent recipe,put this together for tomorrows family dinner soon as I saw it,and it tastes sooooo good.I used rotel,my favorite.Thanks for posting."
940306,328442,2008-11-10,5,This is a good and fluffy spread
236470,139972,2005-10-22,5,"Tried these for dessert today with lunch. They were very good and i hope to try them again as they were very tasty and easy to make.

Thanks once again  for a wonderful recipe."
2634002,487626,2013-01-25,5,"Fantastic!  Our rolls weren't the prettiest, but the taste was excellent.  :)"
1210457,114993,2009-10-11,5,AWESOME!!!!  I only make this recipe and have bookmarked it on my laptop so it is easy to find.  Thanks Heather.
221734,173438,2007-04-01,5,"similar to my chilled apple-tuna salad and so refreshing...

AND walnuts are supposed to be great for health,for a healthy heart...

FABULOUS!"
248647,136550,2005-10-03,5,Another easy adn delish recipe! They were simple enough for me to have the kids help and they loved eating them fresh out of the oven. Froze more for snacks later. Thanks!
60992,93385,2004-07-13,3,"I had problems with this dish, however I will try it again and re-review if things change as I think it has great potential. First thing was the 5 spice powder refused to encorperate with the other ingreidents. I used low sodium terriyaki and soy sauce and the dish was way too salty (and I adore salty). Perhaps this came from the fact that for the ""extra"" flavor I marinated for about 10 hours...less than the 12-24 suggested. It does make fantastically moist chicken however....and I never did figure out what to do with the extra water and cornstarch, the directions never said. I imagine it was to thicken the sauce, but since it was WAY too salty that wasn't going to happen. Shredding the chicken and serving it minimally over rice is what saved it. Like I said I think this recipe has great potential and I will try it again...with slight modifications."
319738,186255,2006-10-10,5,"This was a great easy sauce!  I made the sauce with a mixture of mozzerella and parmesean (since the mozzerella is so mild, I added extra--about a cup of cheese total) and also added 1/2 tsp of a dried ""Italian Seasoning"" spice mix to the mustard, salt, and pepper.  A wonderful change to the usual pasta sause--and great for so many more uses!  Thank you!"
212088,70685,2006-06-13,5,This is delicious.  Don't use the marinade as a dipping sauce due to bacteria from the raw chicken; make a separate batch for dipping. 
579298,69173,2007-11-30,5,I went with the ground white turkey... these were the best meatballs I have ever had! It was amazing to experience the differece adding milk made. And the cooking technique (in the sauce) deserves its OWN 5 star rating! You need to try this one!
326409,22176,2006-12-30,5,Yum yum yum!  This was delicious!  It didn't look like it would make enough but we had leftovers for the next day.  I also added some chili pepper flakes and diced red and green peppers and mushrooms.  It was so good!  Thanks!
211184,150700,2006-08-07,5,"I made this with a nice bowl of French Onion soup in mind. I had shredded parmesan on hand and fresh jumbo garlic from the Farmer's Market. It smelled, and tasted so wonderful that we never had the soup, we just snacked on the bread! Thanks for sharing. Nick's Mom "
240668,113292,2007-08-08,4,Very good.  I used a whole pint of blueberries and baked this in a loaf pan for about 50 minutes.  I skipped the glaze since I like my breakfast foods less sweet.  I've learned from past experiences that in the summer my house gets so warm that berries in breads and muffins will start to ferment and get a funky taste... so I cut the loaf in half and froze half and stored the other in the fridge with very good results.
357389,153448,2008-09-22,5,Like the others I thought my mom invented it! haha It really is so good.
58225,99870,2006-12-12,5,Loved this soup - perfect for a cold winter night - very easy to make too.  I substituted the water and beef bouillion for 32 oz container of beef broth.  This is a keeper.
1892127,3110,2011-04-22,0,"I haven't tried this recipe, but agree that chicken feet are an under-used and under-appreciated ingredient.  As a child, these would always be part of soup, and occasionally we'd have them as an appetizer...almost as a pseudo hot wing.  Very very yummy!"
82567,76029,2003-11-11,5,"this was wonderful, very moist..reminded me of lasanga(is that spelled wrong? hehe)...I think it would be good with black olives and mushrooms also, but I made it exactly as directed..My family really enjoyed this, will be making again...strawberryjane"
678366,453394,2011-04-29,5,"Loved it!!! One of the best rolls I ever had...the combination of scallions (that's what I used instead of chives),garlic powder and sugar was great!"
1537400,108449,2010-02-07,0,"This is our new, favorite Rotkohl recipe! I pared the recipe down to 4 servings as I was only serving my husband and myself. This did not compromise the quality of this flavorful dish. Also had to adjust a few ingredients to what I had on hand, such as dry marjoram instead of fresh, bottled minced ginger instead of fresh, cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar (had just ran out!). Even with these slight changes, we were thrilled with your recipe, BecR. Thank you! Randy and Cathy Myers"
64642,35775,2004-02-12,5,We really enjoyed this one.
457829,39087,2007-06-04,5,this is very good very easy to make great combo of flavors the only change i did was to add a can of mushrooms resturant quality eats here thanks for sharing
140737,161390,2006-08-14,4,"Absolutely lovely.  Didn't even need the peppers to make this a piquant dish that has not only provided a new, different, and filling meal, it made the house smell great.   Since I'm not so much into the frying, I'm going to try this in the crockpot next time.  Absolutely wonderful."
140806,7791,2009-01-30,5,"I made this sauce for Easy and Tasty BBQ Chicken Sandwiches #95569. Dh loved it! I think he was expecting a sweeter taste, but he enjoyed the heat and tang from this recipe. 
Thanks!"
71840,16110,2003-12-12,5,"We really loved these cookies. My husband shared them with one of his classmates. The friend asked if it was my ""specialty."" He said no, she just made them last night for the first time. Thanks for making me look like an old pro!"
2001604645,349246,2017-06-29,5,It tasted like a regular brownie but even better!
869378,120761,2008-07-12,0,"I made this recipe with the rye flour, as suggested.  It was inedible.  I don't recommend this option at all.  Perhaps I'll try it again with whole wheat flour. Sorry."
55785,44437,2002-12-02,5,This is one of the most delicious breads I have ever eaten..And so easy to make..Thank you Elizabeth Fox...Art
125458,57402,2005-06-26,4,"good seasonal cake that packs a zesty citrus smack. i hate raisins so omitted that, and i used orange juice instead of the 2tsp lemon juice. i poked small holes in the cake before showering it with an orange glaze. i would have preferred it to be moister but it was still tasty and refreshing."
1363063,134071,2011-03-19,2,"I an not looking for a loaf cake  that falls in the center, (as shown in the photo).  But I will happiily try again. :)"
1794450,270855,2011-01-13,5,This recipe is excellent!  My husband says it's the tastiest prepared tilapia he's had and I agree.  I used light sour cream and reduced the butter by half and it was still very decadent. Highly recommend!
2002012519,79380,2018-02-24,0,55 years ago I made Suomalainen joululaji to help a Finnish student (who didn't bake). I remember the pastry as having begun with whipped cream into which the flour was folded. Does that sound familiar to anyone? Thanks so much for all of your recipes! I found the recipe in a library book.
1523882,90673,2010-01-21,5,Really good flavor!!!!
266635,424326,2013-02-01,5,"I knew I would love these carrots the minute I read the recipe and I was absolutely correct!  Roasting the carrots along with the almonds made them sooo good!  I divided up the carrots -- one half was made as per recipe and they were wonderful.  With the rest of the carrots, I tossed them right out of the oven with a little honey and served just as they were.  Both ways came out excellent.  This recipe is headed to my Best of 2013 file for sure.  Made for Best of 2012 tag."
895822,221743,2008-11-05,5,very flavorful and the kids LOVED it! I'm always trying out new ways to cook a whole chicken and this one really hit the spot.
2000484243,507011,2016-05-20,0,"I wish I had had this yesterday--two of our grandkids were here yesterday helping us mow--I made poutine with fries, cheese curds and beef gravy. It was great--but just think how mind blowing this recipe would have been. I will be getting back with you because D. Mac and Shel will be down once a week until they go back to school in the fall. Dixie in Eolia P.S. will rate after I have wowed them."
199848,204642,2007-09-30,5,"Absolutely terrific!  I used the frozen chip steak meat just as written, and fried it with onions.  This is a super tasty cheesesteak.  Loved the creamy mashed avocados!  I make cheesesteaks every year for the Super Bowl.  These are already on my Super Bowl menu for 2008.  Thanx!"
352845,214498,2009-04-18,5,Eating these took me back to my Italian grandmother's kitchen the the smell of anise.  They are wonderful!  Thank you so much for my trip down memory lane.
280166,108572,2006-10-16,4,"I thought this was very tasty, but my husband thought it needed a few more spices."
172410,133812,2006-02-03,4,"These potatoes sure tasted good, but they took forever to bake. Like Wreckage, I had to bake for almost an hour. I think the dish I baked them in was not the best choice, though. It was one of those round, deep casserole dishes. Next time I'll try it with a shallower rectangle so that the potatoes can be spread out more. I think that will shorten the baking time."
464080,338278,2009-02-01,4,"Very nice recipe.  I used tenderloins and cut each one into 3 ""nuggets"".  The only thing is that I wish they were more crunchy, so next time I will cook in oven and then briefly pan fry to get the crunch.  We dipped ours in buffalo sauce and BBQ sauce.  Served for the Superbowl this evening!  Made for my teammate for AUS/NZ monthly tag."
1360568,269104,2009-08-23,4,"I am not much of a cook, a beginner, and this recipe was super easy and came out tasting great!  At first I wasn't too sure about how the cheese would taste, but once I tried it there seemed to be only a hint of the cheese flavor - maybe it adds moistness?  Like I said, I'm a beginner.  I used crushed crackers with parmesan cheese and dried basil instead of the Italian breadcrumbs (per my friend's suggestion), but I still think it came out fine.  Thanks for the recipe, I'm planning to make it again! :)"
999917,95159,2008-11-06,5,Add bacon on top of cheese.
705251,436254,2010-12-14,5,Another exceptional recipe Boomie!  I used sour cream and chocolate chips (as you allowed in the ingredients) and skipped the walnuts only in the topping.  What a nice moist muffin with great muffin tops!  The recipe gave me 12 perfect muffins!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe in Potluck Tag!  :)
985766,246103,2011-04-05,5,"After reading the reviews I couldn't wait to try these.  They came out awesome!  Sure they are sweet.  Most recipes with chocolate and caramel are... DUH!   If you don't like sweet, then don't eat sweets. They are called that for a reason!  Make em and see for yourself how yummy they are!"
250031,297856,2009-08-14,5,"Delicious and so easy! I used Newman's Own Alfredo sauce and was in a bit of a hurry, so I just used frozen baby florets of broccoli - which worked just fine. I didn't use the 4-cheese Mexican blend, but instead decided on Parmesan cheese. I also did not use nearly as much cheese (maybe not even half) and it was still great! I will definitely be making this recipe again. Thank you for sharing!"
121185,32204,2008-06-13,5,Like it even needs another review - but yowza!  These were super tasty!
258895,151090,2006-07-22,5,I adore the flavor and texture of sweet potatoes - and this recipe underscores their greatness!  Bravo!
220348,216249,2007-08-06,5,"I enjoyed this very much. I loved the mix of all the ingredients. I did use the lemon flavoured and I don't think I would use any other flavour. I used some cherries, as it is expensive, but not for every serving."
266635,86940,2014-04-11,5,"This is a great version of oven-fried chicken.  It was moist, flavorful and crispy -- just perfect.  DH really enjoyed it as well and told me to be sure to save this recipe : ) .  Will definitely be making this recipe again.  Made for Spring PAC, April, 2014."
231897,32734,2005-11-09,5,quick & easy recipe!  Turned out great with 1/2 cup sugar & stone ground whole wheat flour.    I used organic blueberries but plan to try many variations.  Thanks!!
369715,407165,2010-04-12,4,Good basic recipe. We thought it needed some spices but we did enjoy them.
81611,91172,2008-03-02,5,"A friend made this for me last week, and it was so good I went out and bought the ingredients right away and made it for my family. They all loved it. I forgot I didn't have linguine on hand, so I used fettucine. I used 1/2 the parsley because I used dried. I also doubled the garlic because we love it so. I ran short on time, so only simmered the sauce about 5 minutes, but that just made it go farther (I made extra noodles). It was great with roasted asparagus and salad!"
133174,443127,2010-12-18,3,Made half a recipe for the 2 of us. The sauce was easy to put together with ingredients I had on hand.  I was a little disappointed in the finished product.  Mine did not develop a very heavy glaze. It was served with brown rice and a tossed salad for a delicious meal. Good luck in the contest.
42337,27733,2004-05-15,5,"Very easy to make and very moist.  Outstanding and simple.  I doubled the recipe after reading all the other reviews, I kept the cayenne pepper as my son loves hot stuff and I did add a little grated parmasean cheese."
765915,29100,2009-03-18,5,"I really enjoyed this bread!  It came out perfect: slightly crisp on the outside and soft with small holes on the inside.  Since I am lactose intolerant, I substituted the milk for plain soy milk that I warmed before using.  The bread tasted wonderful.  I was also excited to finally use the bread stone I have.  I will be making this bread again soon."
25792,97989,2004-08-30,5,"ellie...These are super...rich, chewy and a real treat!  We loved them, especially BF who is a oatmeal cookie nut!!  I made them without the nuts and I think that I only put in 2 cups of flour instead of 2 1/2 BUT that only made them more chewier and more oatmeal tasting.  A word to the wise, make sure to use a 10x15 pan with about a 1 inch side as they dont run over the pan but they will come very very close if you just use a thinner pan.  Mine is like a cookie sheet with smaller sides and I had to put a bigger sheet underneath them.  The chocolate layer is to die for but it is soft and makes for spreading the oatmeal a little difficult.  I just kinda globbed it on and then carefull spread it around.  As long as you get enough topping in each cut piece they are fine, but if you dont you will have to eat them with a fork because you cant pick up only the chocolate.  Sorry if this seems critical, dont mean for it to be as these truly are a quick and yummy bar cookie..Thanx ellie!"
1403832,4292,2009-10-07,5,"Very nice, and just to add, one can save a lot of money using this as opposed to buying the sodium filled junk at the store.  I doubled the recipe and it was enough to fill perhaps a small plastic container.  Noted that I made recipe 4957 with this (Crock Pot Chicken Taco Meat) and the chicken provided an easy and very flavorful meal with some basic guacamole, Veronica's Easy Spanish Rice, recipe 37,638, and fresh tortillas from our local Central Market ( a FW/D gem)."
140132,18319,2013-01-02,5,"These little gems were a huge hit at our Christmas Eve meal.  We served appys with our soup and these were amoungst the favorites.  DD thought they sounded ""weird"" and not too appetizing, BUT, she loved them.  And then dipped in the dip, delicious.  Thank you for sharing with us a new favorite."
589729,164551,2008-01-02,4,"I actually would give thses a 4.5. The only think I thought was off, at least for my taste was the nutmeg. It was a little strong. Next time I will use only a 1/4 tsp instead. Very moist, and rose nicely while cooked. These do not rise too much though, so fill the pans about 3/4 the way full. Thanks for posting such a healthy snack."
1142192,220759,2009-09-14,5,Marinade is fabulous!  Great dish to make with flank steak.
1802638630,514605,2014-04-02,5,awesome possum -- it&#039;s good to know that I can have In-N-Out style food at home without having to actually go outside and put on pants and socialize with the real world. Really great recipe :)
377161,101098,2009-06-26,5,"Scaled it down and make as recipe stated. Very good. My
DH loved it also. Thanks for sharing such a quick, tasty salad!!"
539315,93446,2007-08-13,5,This was fabulous! It wasn't too sweet and I used 100% w/w flour and it rose beautifully and it stayed light and spongy and fluffy! Yum!
266710,140915,2011-01-19,4,"This turned out pretty tasty, although my first reaction to it was that I was eating the filling of a chicken pot pie. Same ingredients I guess. I decided not to eat it as-is, as a main dish, but cut up the chicken, added some peas and a few seasonings, and poured it into a store-bought crust for a real chicken pot pie dinner. Turned out great, especially considering the ease of preparation! I think another tasty variation would be adding dumplings. Yummm. Thanks for sharing this versatile recipe!"
65338,51199,2008-03-27,5,"These were wonderful.  I used cake flour instead of all purpose, and let the cut doughnuts rise in the refrigerator over night for a more tender texture (and a quicker morning meal)  I used cream in the glaze instead of water, whole milk in the dough, and the chopstick idea is genius.  Thanks!"
1265057,141796,2009-06-08,5,Comfort food at its best.  The lemon juice gives this dish a nice tang.  Thank you.
1085545,74634,2008-12-19,5,"I don't even know how I stumbled across this recipe other than I was looking for a quick batch of cookies to make up.  My first batch made up soft but after adjusting the baking time (1 min,30 sec additional) they came out perfect.  I would definetly follow the advise of baking on tin foil if you do not have a nonstick cookie sheet as they do stick.  I also found if you let the dough sit for about 15 minutes the oats have a richer flavor.  I brought these to our Christmas party and they were gone in a flash!!  They are pretty and I can't wait to make them for easter as well."
1176849,56366,2009-11-01,5,"I am just getting around to rating this recipe. It is a wonderful tasty soup. I add a can of diced tomatoes and some frozen mixed vegetables to mine. I use the small shells for my pasta. I bring a batch to my Mum when ever I make it. She raves about it. I do not add the yellow split peas, mainly because I never have them in the cupboard. Thanks for this great recipe."
86764,193559,2007-02-03,5,"I love mangos.  They are so unique in their flavor and this recipe will for SURE be repeated around my house, especially when those mangos are on sale.  I know it says 2 servings, but hey, if you're serving me, better make more than that because those 2 are MINE!  This was probably a bit of a no-no because of the sweetened milk, but I figured I deserved a treat with my nutritious Banana Hotdog that I really didn't feel coffee would do justice.  YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY, Sharon...keep on with the fruity stuff...you know I love it!"
2001477029,17782,2017-10-14,5,"This is a delicious pie crust, and it's super easy to make."
625696,38298,2010-11-22,4,"I've never had the Olive Garden version, but this was very tasty!  We left out the bacon and used spinach instead of kale.  This soup will be a repeat this coming winter."
302935,54345,2008-02-09,4,"I made this with Hershey Kisses and egg whites only.  IT WAS Perfect.  The other change I made was to bake in mini-loaf silicone pans and glass custard cups.  Both worked well, and made for very nice single servings.  Next time, I will make it 6 servings because the mix does rise when baked, and it was over the edge on the cups."
149291,200460,2006-12-19,5,"A wonderful Christmas cookie.  I rolled mine in red/green/white jimmies before I ""thumbprinted"" them. Taste great, look pretty.  Thank you for posting this one!"
441981,136990,2008-05-14,4,"This is good! I used ground beef, 3 cloves of garlic and canned tomatoes. I also added more cheese (monterey jack and cheddar). I served it with salsa, sour cream and black olives."
121185,20287,2006-03-24,4,We like to bring our crockpot with us inthe RV if we know we're going to have hook ups.  We made this while in Mexico and shared it with our neighbors.  Between the 8 of us IT WAS GONE!  The kids LOVED it with vanilla ice cream.  Oh!  I did use 2 cans of peaches and it came out soupy but good more like an ice cream topping!
2000456058,113138,2017-03-17,5,"I make mussels occasional throughout the year. They are one of my absolute favorites. My daughter has requested them for her birthday dinner for the last 2 years (she just turned 5 yesterday). I made them for her, as requested, and they were AMAZING! Easily, the best mussels we've ever eaten - home or restaurant. The only changes made were that I added extra Dijon mustard and doubled the sauce - because we love to dip in the bread."
1684782,167136,2013-05-24,5,Super delicious and super easy!  I&#039;ve eaten at Pollo Loco dozens of times (if not more) and this salsa is at least as good as the salsa they serve.
1602731,313040,2010-06-15,5,"Sinfully Delicious!!!  Especially with 2 to 3 scoops of these lovely strawberries over a good slice of angel food cake and do not forget the sauce. What makes this strawberry recipe outstanding over others I have tried is the added lemon juice. It cuts into the sugary sweetness and draws out the true strawberry flavors.  So glad you
shared this. Thanks so much and
5 stars just isn't enough..."
407088,278735,2008-09-03,5,"Great chicken!!!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and it probably sat in the marinade for about 6 hours.  There was an excess of marinade, so next time, I'm going to use 1/2 of the marinade on the chicken and put some veggies in 1/2 of it.

Thanks, Redsie, for yet another great recipe!"
2001600316,141983,2017-06-26,4,"Okay so I just made it and followed the recipe. While it turned out perfect and tasted okay it's missing something. I was thinking about adding mushrooms,shrimp and either nutmeg or paprika; but not both. Also I couldn't really taste the pepper so I'm wondering about using regular pepper. Any thoughts or suggesstions?"
9869,331445,2008-12-01,4,"This recipe made 8 tasty tuna patties. I also cooked them in the oven and found them just a little dry, but the yoghurt sauce gave them a refreshing flavour. Easy to prepare. Thanks for sharing."
1193425,335622,2009-03-06,5,This was great and so easy.  I made it with pancetta but I'm not sure I could really tell it was there so next time I'll try it without and save the calories.  I'm sure it will be just as good.  My husband loved it and said definitely make again!
192852,53508,2007-03-02,4,"I made this on Thursday, we ate it all up and on Friday I was making it again. :) 
An easy-to-prepare taste treat! I served mine on a crossaint and it was awesome! Tried it on pita the next day and wasnt as outstanding, but had a lot less calories on the pita. lol
Thanks for sharing!"
52262,85957,2004-07-24,5,Very good and easy to make!  I added 2 cups of cheese instead of 1 cup.  I also made a whole 16 ounce box of macaroni and used a 9 x 13 pan.
2690988,495271,2013-02-13,5,Great recipe!
980309,294898,2008-10-06,2,I give this a 2 only because it looks like its susposed to. The flaver is awful. My 2 year old who eats everything wouldn't even touch this.
1708518,157226,2010-10-19,0,"I made this for a fund raiser for Romanian orphans ...  served 120 ... it is wonderful.  Romanian visitor said it is better than the ""meech"" in Romania"
483341,25094,2007-04-19,5,"Amazing recipe. All previous reviews were absolutely true: juicy and tender chicken, delicious sauce. My husband was more than satisfied :)"
37636,247149,2009-03-01,4,"Very delicious and definitely spicy! I am sure the curry paste adds more depth of flavor than just using chili paste. We enjoyed the combination of veggies in this. It is always nice to find one that uses cabbage, which always cooks up nicely and pairs with noodles very well. Thanks for sharing! ~Sue"
195859,186693,2006-12-02,5,"This was wonderful!  I used ground chicken, diet coke, and black beans instead.  This soup is a ""keeper."""
13483,98716,2006-04-29,5,There is nothing special with the ingredients in this recipe but  the flavour is terrific.  I added extra onions and cheese and thought the results were fantastic.  Love my bread machine and these ingredients will be in it often.  Thanks Bonnie b
171790,425853,2010-05-20,5,"I had this as a delicious take-along dinner at work tonight. I prepared it this afternoon, refrigerated it and reheated the soup a few hours later. I did include a couple of German sausages and added a couple of dashes of Maggi for just a bit of extra flavor. Made for ZWT6."
83060,47091,2003-04-21,5,"I haven't tried this yet, but I have tried my version, which is like yours and it is a great inexpensive dinner and so easy and tasty.  I don't do dairy so I don't use butter for the potatoes.  But I also add sweet corn bread squares and what a meal!  Thanks."
101823,68663,2003-11-15,5,"As the previous review stated, this is a true keeper.  We really like this warm appetizer to balance with our spread of the fresh veggies and cheese and crackers.  I have added finely chopped green pepper, too.  Men and women love this appetizer."
582561,428670,2010-06-11,4,Great taste.  I blended the soup totally.  My soup was a little on the thin side and next time I would use only 5 cups of water and maybe an extra potato to give it thicker texture.  I served with bacon garnish and crusty wholegrain taost.
136865,109943,2005-09-18,5,"This is now my favorite roast recipe.  Digging through my freezer the other day, I found a 5 lb eye round roast.  I got on recipezaar, and entered the key words.  This recipe was awesome.  The flavor and texture was one mouthwatering combination.  This one's a keeper! "
1264306,104052,2010-07-04,5,"This was a great recipe! I saw that some reviewers complained about the texture that the bread crumbs gave the sausage, and all I could think was, ""but the texture is what makes it English sausage!"" I prefer English style sausage (and especially English style back bacon) to the American types, and I have paid exorbitant prices to buy English style sausages from specialty shops, so I was very excited to see this recipe.  I was delighted with the results!  I used a package of ground pork I bought at the grocery store, which was not ground as finely as this recipe called for, and I cooked it in patties since I couldn't make links, but even so, the texture was much closer to the English style, and the flavor was BANG ON. I won't be buying prepackaged sausage meat anymore! In fact, I may have to invest in a sausage stuffer and start having a butcher finely grind pork for me. Thanks, Gerry!"

1803340899,323402,2014-11-23,5,This is the same recipe my Mom used when I was young. I loved her stuffing. I can&#039;t wait to make this on Thanksgiving.
1006272,70399,2008-11-15,4,This was really good. The chicken was very moist and it was not too acidic because of the preserves. It had a more creamy sauce than normal tomato sauce. It got thumbs up from hubby and 3 out of 5 kids.
599450,491361,2012-12-25,5,"Easy, simple, and very delicious. This is my kind of Asian-Peanut and Pasta Salad. Served with Grilled Asian Salmon, recipe #491833, for a perfect after work dinner. Thanks, Nancy's Pantry! Made for Make My Recipe tag game."

435629,81584,2008-02-07,1,"Unfortunately this recipe shouldn't be classified as a korean dish.  I'm half korean and my mother, who is full korean, cooked mondoo when I was a child.  This isn't authentic...green pepper, cheese and cooked rice?  Anything fried should taste good, but knowing what real mondoo or korean potstickers are...this is a let down."
29782,90151,2006-06-01,5,Delicious bread! We all enjoyed it. Our neighbor brought his bread machine to the lake and he wanted me to show him how to work it. I had all but the bread flour so I used all purpose flour for this recipe. I made this up and showed him how to work his bread machine. He was thrilled with the results! He kept bragging the next morning on how good it was.  So I came home and made a loaf for DH and I too. I did use 1c. of wheat flour and 2c. bread flour and used 2tsp. yeast. It turned out great!! Soft and fluffy and I can't wait to try toasting a slice. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.
796329,273618,2008-03-20,5,This is a great recipe.  I used whole boneless skinless breasts and baked at 350 for 30min while simmering the gravy then 15 min with the gravy dumped in the baking dish.  I also added a pound of sliced mushrooms to the gravy.  SUPER GOOD!
43083,102909,2006-08-31,4,I made this using regular mustard because I didnt have any honey! I still thought it was quite tasty! Thanks for an easy dinner last night Lori! :) (My fellow WILD FLOUR!!)
131126,161334,2006-03-08,4,This made an easy and quick supper which is always a plus. I found the chicken a tad  bland and would add more seasoning next time. I think just a bit more seasonings would let the chicken shine inside the wrap.  The creamy sauce did perk things a up a bit and was well used here.  I also added shredded lettuce and thin sliced purple onions before rolling in the flat bread. I would make this one again.  Good luck in the contest! 
988292,392727,2010-05-18,5,I was looking for something easy to make for dinner when I came across this recipe. I was a little concerned making it due to my roommate who despises meatloaf. But I took a chance and as it was cooking the smell sparked her interest and when dinner was served she tried it. And before you know it she was asking for seconds! This is a winner!
860054,8567,2008-06-12,5,Absolutely love this recipe!  One of my favorites I have found yet.  Thank you for sharing.
851190,55,2010-05-23,5,I used Italian plum tomatoes for this as they are firm and not real juicy.  They worked great and the dip was awesome!  The lime really adds a depth of flavor that we just love!
37779,18675,2003-01-18,5,"This is an outstanding way to cook salmon. Very easy to make, too. I lightly brushed the salmon with the melted butter and didn't use all of the remaining 2 tablespoons. The crumb crust was wonderfully seasoned and crunchy. An elegant entree. Thanks Inez. "
67656,246581,2007-12-14,5,"I used this recipe tonight for scrambled eggs on toast.  The bit of powdered milk added a bit of richness to my egg whites without the calories and cholesterol of yolks. I did not add food coloring as my only yellow dye is an electric/acid, not appealing for this purpose.  Thanks Nyte."
625696,345899,2009-07-28,4,"Enjoyed these a lot.  I added garlic powder based on other reviews.  Didn't have buttermilk, so I just used 1% milk and it worked fine.  Will make again, and probably play with the flavorings or add-ins each time.  Thanks!"
323933,32113,2009-11-08,5,EZ is right!  I doubled the recipe since I had 6 apples to use up.  Next time I'll try to lessen the amount of butter and substitute a low-fat spread.  Thank you so much for the recipe!
1361992,283664,2009-09-06,5,"I saw these and knew I had to get out the flour and make some!   I doubled the recipe for the muffins, then I made up the glaze using the lemon and then made up another batch using some frozen blueberries and some of the juice instead of the sugar and lemon, then I mixed them together and drizzled over the blueberries.  What a sensational breakfast muffin treat!"

444132,233103,2009-05-12,5,"Mmmm, this was wonderful and so easy to make!  I made Ciabatta to use as the bread, and that was a good choice.

280271,308876,2008-07-18,5,DH took one bite and said Wow! these are good. I made half a recipe and they came out perfect. We really enjoyed them. Quick and easy recipe to prepare. I did double the sesame seeds because it just didn't look like much. This is a keeper thanks loof for posting.
46431,1136,2002-08-28,5,Great!  I used 1 lb ground beef and substituted black beans for kidney beans.  Very good and easy.
55729,45008,2011-03-14,4,"I had never tried a recipe like this because I was a grapefruit ""purist"" and thought I loved it plain. Well, when the Christmas grapefruit were still in the refrigerator in March, I realized that wasn't true! This is so easy, and gives the fruit just a little oomph to make it really tasty. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to mix the sugar and cinnamon together before sprinkling."
599126,28768,2014-06-07,5,"This was a very good recipe.  I followed the ingredients exactly.  The only change I made was that I reserved some of the sauce to put on top of the last layer of noodles, then I topped with the mozzarella cheese.  Delicious!"
92625,24709,2003-07-27,5,"Oh, my gosh this was good!  I used Laurie's My No Roll Pie Crust (#51537) and it was the easiest pie I ever made.  In the summer when we pick berries, sometimes a cooked blueberry pie is just too heavy.  This one is light and so full of blueberry flavor!  YUM!!!"
283390,66758,2006-10-28,5,"Delicious!! I love the combination of horseradish and beets, and the yogurt/beet combo makes the most incredible color!

537937,398538,2009-11-26,5,"This recipe is delicious albeit a tad labor intensive.  I will say this was my first attempt at making a baked cheesecake using a spring-form pan and so I was a little leery.  Mine took 1 1/2 hours to bake which made the edges quite brown and the center not quite set.  I probably baked it too long, but didn't dare remove from the oven as the middle was very giggly.  I ended up finally turning the oven off and leaving the door open with the cake inside for another hour.  I then left it in the pan overnight and removed the sides the following morning.  I put cherry pie filling around the edges and then in the very center to hide all the flaws.  The taste was still great and it went over very well at our Thanksgiving Day dinner.  
Made for PRMR.~"

280271,152218,2006-12-10,5,"I just noticed that tonight I made two recipes that Parsley has submitted. This is another 5 star in my book. I did not have baby new potatoes, but I did have Yukon and I quartered them and cooked them for 40 minutes due to the size. They came out perfect. I also cut the recipe in half cuz there's only the two of us. Made this with recipe #46330 and #150547.  DH said I need to make the whole meal again. Thanks, again Parsley for posting another keeper."
288146,332033,2011-12-11,5,Delicious!  I made these in place of my standard candied sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving since a guest of ours has gluten and dairy allergies.  They were so delicious and you truly don't miss all of the bad stuff.  I added some extra cinnamon and nutmeg and they were perfect.  That same guest took the leftovers home and made some little tarts with a gluten free crust and they tasted just like pumpkin pie!  I told her she will be making the dessert next year :)  Thanks so much for posting!
600761,210467,2008-04-08,4,"Yummy! I used a whole can of cranberry sauce, reduced the ketchup to 1/2 cup and the brown sugar to 1/8 cup. I added 1/4 cup of water so there would be enough liquid for the simmer stage. I let is simmer for about 10 minutes after bringing it to a boil and the chicken was very moist. While sweet, it wasn't overwhelming and the sauce ingredients combined nicely. It was very good and my kids ate it without complaint (an unusual occcurrence :) I will definitely make again and it has been added to my regular weeknight rotation. Thanks for posting it!"
2001245220,107017,2016-11-14,1,WAY to much sour cream and cream of mushroom! Very disappointed.
466503,211831,2007-03-16,5,"I made one similar:  but used whole chicken breasts baked in oven for healthier choice.  I coated the chicken in flour, dipped in egg and then rolled in almonds.  I used fresh onion sauteed, poultry seasoning orange marmalade, orange juice, orange peel and milk.  The flavour was fantastic.  

My husband is a plain meat and potato man, but he really enjoyed this, even with the sauce."
262129,133245,2006-05-06,5,"So I guessed at the oven temperature!  350F?  Also...I didn't sear the pork first.  Our American little piggies are so lean these days.  I was afraid of tough-as-an-old-boot meat.  So.  I layered the ingredients in my Le Creuset oval French Oven.  Pork (seasoned with cinnamon, salt and black pepper), Plums,  onion (and leek)...and again. I also added orange slices between the layers. The meat melted in my mouth.  The sauce thickened nicely (we added more black pepper to it!).  We served it with JenT's Easy Spinach Salad (our new favorite) with sliced, raw red onion.  This was very easy and healthy.  No starch needed!  To the Winner's Circle!"
891763,147335,2008-07-14,5,"i made this 2 times lol, i was determined, i did 2 cups of water and it was a mush mushy messy the second time i did it with just one cup and it was perfect.  Tastes just like the real thing and i love it.  You must do exactly like the recipes says.  i actually did not use lots of lime juice it did stick together but i think that is cuz i suck at making rice i never ever get it right, but a little sticky compared to mushy ill take anyday. thanks"
359724,116882,2008-10-22,5,"I wish I could give this ten stars! As I began cooking my boyfriend said ""I don't like coconut milk"" but it was too late, not another thing in the house to eat. So we cooked it up and he LOVED it, we wanted to lick our plates clean. This reminds me of kang phat, from our local thai place. I think it would be great on chicken. We poured the sauce over steamed green beans too. Delish! Thanks for sharing the recipe"
348437,17356,2007-03-31,5,"My husband actually said ""okay this is the best banana pudding I've ever had"" so it's definitely 5 stars in my book!! The only thing I changed is that I used 4oz of cream cheese, about 3 c milk and didn't use the sweetended condensed milk at all. I used sugar free pudding also and you really can't tell that it was sugar free! I used 9x13 dish too, by the way. This hit the spot!!"
87023,117226,2005-05-15,5,"Thought this was great, had it with some steamed fish.  I do think you should use a good quality mayo, I had this over baby cos lettuce and it was a really light meal with the steamed fish."

We will have these again."
36944,68178,2003-08-05,5,This recipe is easy to follow and easy to make.  I used shredded hash browns because that's what I had on hand. I baked it for 40-45 minutes.  There were just two of us eating so I halved the recipe and it worked great.  This has many possibilities for additions.  Thanks for sharing your Mom's recipe Tammi!

279205,179042,2007-04-27,5,"There is a reason folks have been making Pepper JELLY for over 100 years (well, in New Orleans they have); straining it eliminates the skin particles. This recipe has quite good flavor but those tiny pieces of pepper skin are annoying in that they stick to teeth. Two friends who sampled this looked like they had bleeding gums. Will NOT make again."
2001606947,530478,2017-10-24,5,We loved this. Easy and delicious item for a group appetizer or light evening meal. It's a great new way to eat those shrimp.
1942742,153368,2016-03-05,5,"I made these exactly as written, except that I didn&#039;t pull out any fibers and they were absolutely delicious.  I agree with some others that they could have boiled for less time, as some were quite mushy.  Still, they fried up beautifully in about 4 or 5 minutes and tasted great.  Like another reviewer, I&#039;ve thought about baking them, but I&#039;m hesitant to mess with a good thing."
1180216,142232,2009-02-22,5,Wonderful recipe!  I've made this several times now and my husband raves about it!  Yum!
573325,452814,2013-03-08,5,"YUMMMMM! What a great mac and cheese recipe! I loved the combination of cheeses and the subtle heat from the cayenne. I was out of tortilla chips, so I didnt use them, but next time Im making this, Ill definitely add them, too.<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this keeper, starry!<br/>Made and reviewed for your win in the Sun and Spice Event February 2013."
277127,32640,2006-11-29,4,"This was a nice change!  I used Thai red curry paste, but only about a teaspoon, which was plenty spicy for me, and didn't have satay sauce, so I simply omitted it.  I used a mix of olive oil & sesame oil... might use all sesame oil next time.  There was not a lot of sauce, which at first seemed disappointing, but the flavours had really coated the vegetables, so it was actually really good.  (I used bok choy, broccoli, celery and red pepper)... I had a handful of shrimp in the freezer, so I used those, as well.  Served with basmati rice... a yummy meal with no caloric guilt!!  It had some kick, and was delicious."
226066,85377,2007-05-02,5,Delicious moist chicken.  So easy to prepare!!  Thanks MaeEast!  Made this for PAC 2007.

719313,24525,2009-01-16,5,"FANTASTIC!  I needed some dressing for a marinade and forgot to pick some up at the store. Reduced the recipe to make one cup, reserved some for a salad, and put the rest in the marinade.  I won't be buying bottled anymore, as I always have these ingredients on hand.  Thanks for sharing!"
167782,123489,2009-10-30,5,This soup is delicious. I used 8 cups of water since broth has so much sodium and 2 chicken thighs instead of beef.  Thank you for sharing!!!
65481,37439,2003-09-01,5,Really good.  Wasn't sure if I was to cover the casserole during baking.  I did and it turned out great.  I added about a 1/16 oz. slice of co-jack cheese (as thin as the deli could slice it) to the top of each breast after complete and let this melt down from natural heat before serving.  A definite repeat.

353579,69294,2008-01-29,4,"These brownies have a wonderful flavor and I will definitely make them again. Next time, I will try using the lesser amount of baking powder to go for a denser brownie, and I will bake them until they are just finished so as not to dry them out. I used a combination of semisweet and white chocolate chips, and I may add a few more next time. The instructions were easy enough for my 8 year old to help me out by reading them on her own. Thanks for posting!"
392984,32441,2007-07-14,5,"I love this soup!  I've been in a very cilantro-y mood lately, and this soup is very easy to make, and fresh-tasting.  I didn't peel and seed the tomato, I just diced it and threw it in. I also added another clove of garlic.  And I didn't add rice, because I felt like the potatoes made it starchy enough for me.  It's a very good summery soup!"
285039,274412,2008-01-02,4,"This was a hearty chowder-like soup.  My family quite enjoyed it.  My thickened up almost too much (more like broccoli casserole)so I added another cup of chicken broth and it still had a thick, smooth chowder texture.  We will add this to our growing list of broccoli soup, since all 4 of my children will eat it!"
1522315,49737,2012-03-12,5,"Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  I didn't have any celery on hand, and frankly I don't think it's needed.  I probably won't add it for next time either.  I'll probably end up mincing up some red pepper and freezing it for future recipes, this was so quick and easy... I adored it.<br/> <br/>UPDATE: I just went to Panera cause we were out and needed something.  Got their black bean soup and my toddler spit it out (loves mine!), and my husband declared that mine (this recipe) is sooooo much better.  And it is!  This recipe blows Panera's out of the water!"
672695,204703,2009-05-18,4,"Concept is very good.   We baked on rack on cookie sheet and it was very crispy.  Would try cream cheese and jalepanos in the middle next time as my family likes it spicy!
Makes a lot.  Would cut in half next time!!!"
2000222771,32386,2015-05-24,3,This is a good recipe. I am not sure where in GA they make this. I have lived in GA for 45 years and i have never had or made this with carrots.
297076,103215,2010-05-30,5,"My 9-year-old has an addiction to Panda Express' Orange Chicken. We decided to give this one a shot and it's pretty darn close - in fact, his 7-year-old sister ate this one but won't eat it at the fast food joint, so it must be good. It was a bit of work to make, but a keeper because we could adjust the salt/oil/sugar."
95743,37479,2004-12-31,5,"I know it's sacrilege but serving this as written to my Dh would be tantamount to homicide, so I made the lowfat varsion.  I made boursin cheese #36859 with neufchatel and used fat free half and half hoping that the potatoes would provide enough starch to prevent the half and half from separating.  Don't try that, it doesn't work.  Next time I'll try fat free evaporated milk.  This version looked  a little bad but still tasted rich, cheesey and garlicky.  The fresh herbs from the garden were welcome additions. "
130663,133718,2006-02-23,5,We really enjoyed the cod cooked this way.
255075,52500,2008-01-06,5,Only had one can of black beans so I used a can of red also - only had key lime juice and no cilantro so I used a little dried coriander (same flavor family).  I made this for a church mexican food lunch and was afraid because the seasoning was so simple.  Left out the red pepper for all of us light weights.  Should not have worried.  This was fresh and yummy and I look forward to compliments.  Thank you for listing.
490931,86307,2010-02-20,5,"Nice change from broiled/fried scallops.  I changed the crackers from 2 cups down to 1. Used half the butter, and added old bay seasoning into the buttermilk/thyme mixture.  Let it marinate for several hours then poured it into a glass baking dish and there you have it.  Also put some fresh squeezed lemon juice over the top before baking.  It was very tasty and gave the scallops a new twist. Will definitely make this again."
2235458,297863,2012-04-10,5,"I took the advice of another reviewer and didn't put as much frosting, and while it tasted great, the consistency was horrible to work with. It was so soft it just fell all over the place.<br/><br/>Yet, even it being like this, everyone complimented that the taste was amazing because it wasn't too cheesy, it was perfect.<br/><br/>I will definitely give it another try and follow the recipe to the T and hopefully it is a ""crusting cream cheese"" as said to be.<br/>Thanks!"
2001330613,25198,2017-03-22,5,Talk about a walk back to my childhood! They were as delicious as I remembered.
169430,415448,2010-07-22,5,This muffin would be really pretty with the sugar and butter topping that I chose to skip. I used Splenda for the sugar and a low sat fat margarine for the butter. They came out very light and popping with flavor. I just love the the lemon and lavender combo. The muffins stayed moist and lovely for 3 days. I will certainly make these again. Instead of an afternoon coffee break this summer try a lemonade break with one of these great muffins.
336058,288781,2008-03-08,4,"I made these with all sucanat, Smart Balance margarine (I know, a sin), almond extract (out of vanilla), less almonds and choc. chips.  I read the Choc. Chip variation and noticed that one used soft white wheat, which is what I grind for cookies.  So I used 2 1/2 C of that for the oatmeal version.  I used my Pampered Chef (2 T) cookie scoop and it made 75 cookies.  I had to bake them for 15-16 minutes b4 I felt they were solid enough.  They're crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Great to have a healthier cookie, but doesn't taste ""healthy""."
552499,98636,2008-07-07,5,Wonderful biscuits! Light and very flavorful.  My family gobbled them right up and asked me to make more! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.
46596,29255,2002-06-27,5,this recipe is soooo easy and soooo good.  you'll need to fix plenty cause seconds will be demanded!
347246,158087,2006-09-23,5,"As the stars say OUTSTANDING!
This was simple to make and very filling!
I also have some premade in baggies for a quicker fix!
I used one of those individual serving containers of natural applesauce, which I think is about 1/2 cup.
 I poured a small amount of sugar free maple syrup over the top before eating. Yum!!
Next time I may try and put frozen blueberries in instead of the raisins!
The recipe is REAL keeper!"
673444,10808,2008-11-12,4,"I thought this was good, my boyfriend said it was bland.  It was super quick and easy and I'll probably make it again. Thanks for posting."
431933,319731,2010-10-01,5,"This was outstanding!  I just made it today and had to write a review.  Not usually a fan of breakfast casseroles, I was skeptical about making this.  But, I had leftover ham and was looking to make the most of it.  This recipe certainly did!  I doubled the recipe and had enough to feed 8 people as the recipe said it would.  Everyone was impressed!  Thanks for posting!"
493507,70522,2009-03-24,1,I actually didnt like the way this turned out as well as boiling the corned beef with seasonings and then adding the cabbage towards the end. I'll stick to the original way Ive done corned beef and cabbage.
330225,168529,2006-09-27,5,"I cannot rave enough about this recipe!! I am new to cooking and my husband never thought I could make something so great! He begs me to make this again and again. The only thing I do is I use shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated, but both ways are great! Thanks for the post!!!"
101253,162961,2012-02-16,5,"Kittencal, you're a genius. This one knocks it outta the park every time. Even with the carnivorous crowd. Thanks a million!"
104295,89481,2004-10-15,4,"It was fine.  Basic pudding recipe.  Nothing incredibly exciting, but a nice end to the meal.  Thanks for getting me to try mixing flavors!"
486725,498847,2014-10-04,5,"Wonderful pizza, with tons of flavor from all the different ingredients. We only added half the chicken, and vegetarians could easily leave it off and still have a very satisfying meal. The other alterations we made for personal preferences were omitting the sugar and using only feta cheese (but at double the amount)."
2174341,341383,2012-02-15,5,"These were very good!  14 minutes is too long though.  I made two mini cakes, baked for about 11 minutes and they were a little overdone.  If you don't think they're done, they're probably done as they continue baking after you take them out.  I served mine with fresh blueberries and a dusting of powdered sugar.  Yum!"
617133,10108,2007-10-16,4,"I cut the sugar in half but still only got about 4 quarts (possibly because each day I had to ""sample"" some. These are delicious and well worth the 3 day wait. Instead of allspice berries I used ground allspice and added a little ground cinnamon. Easy to make but extremely hard to resist !! mmmmm good"
22015,33919,2002-09-02,4,"This was good.  Next time though, I will reduce the taco seasoning by half.  It wasn't so much that it tasted like it was too spicy as the seasoning was a little bit over powering.  Great recipe though.  We will make it again."
2007703,52253,2012-01-07,5,Never had bad chicken and dumplings but this is one of the best I've had!
1891737,151153,2011-05-23,5,"Not seeing it mentioned by anyone else, but I soaked my quinoa for about 18 hours before use (1 cup quinoa to 3 cups water & 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar for better assimilation of nutrients) and per other reviewer's recommendations, I used 4 times the minced garlic & added in diced onions & mushrooms when I put the garlic in. Used 2.5 cups of spinach & could have used another cup or two I think without it being too much. It was *fantastic* we absolutely loved it! This was my first try with quinoa & I think this recipe will become a staple- my picky DH really liked it, as did I & our 2 yr old. Our 5 yr old twins were harder to convince, but once they gave it a try they did like it as well. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"
89831,307616,2009-09-15,5,"I have made something close to this in the past, it's a basic easy dressing that's delicious over mixed greens, I added in a few tablespoons of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and also a clove of minced garlic, thanks for sharing Dreamer!"
132383,107072,2009-04-23,5,I wanted to scarf this down all by myself.  The flavor was awesome.  We love making Asian food at home and this was one of the best things we have gotten to try.  Thank you so much for posting this outstanding recipe! We only used 1 tsp of the red pepper flakes and served with noodles.
390553,40572,2008-10-08,5,This was great and super easy. I did add some corn and potato and a small can of green chiles. I sprinkled some cheddar cheese in too and served with rice. So yummy! Thanks for posting!
2001030522,96827,2016-05-29,5,THANK YOU for posting this!! My mother used to make an egg casserole every year for a charity event at our church (it was a &quot;champagne brunch&quot; so very fancy) and I have been looking for this recipe for YEARS! It is so good.
2001299461,199579,2016-12-15,5,This turned out delicious. I forgot to add milk and still was great. I also added mushrooms which was yummy
424680,292075,2008-04-10,4,"Will admit that there's nothing like a simple, REAL MAPLE SYRUP, but this recipe makes a nice substitute that IS tasty!

Having read reviewer comments regarding saltiness, I added the dressing mix slowly & did use less than the called for amt. It was tasty, but I felt it needed something extra so I added 2 tbsp chili sauce to give it some zip & sprinkled it w/fresh snipped chives. I like the outcome a lot & am sure it will be enjoyed. Thx for sharing this recipe w/us."
415212,118373,2007-11-03,5,This was delicious.  I made it exactly as you put it and it was wonderful. Thanks
267295,116029,2006-09-30,4,"I used snap peas and the entire package of tofu (frozen, defrosted and pressed) and made alot more of the sauce (1/4 cup of each ingredient instead of 1 Tbsp), it turned out excellent!  Great recipe, will be making this more often."
227607,80898,2008-06-27,5,Made for ZWT4...This was a very simple good salad.  I love cranberries so this was right up my alley!!  I love the dressing with the dijon mustard.  I think this is a recipe that I will make often.
37449,462539,2011-09-09,5,This turned out very nice and it was so easy! I used about 2/3 cup oil. I used about 1/2 extra virgin olive oil and 1/2 corn oil. I think next time I will try sunflower oil with just a little bit of olive as it was strong. I loved the way it thickened up and used it in sandwiches and slaw. Thanks for posting!
567663,285876,2008-10-06,5,This was perfect for the appetizer dish I had to bring to a football party over the weekend!!!!

232886,2677,2007-04-08,5,"Can I possibly rate these higher than 5 stars? Made these for Easter dinner, they were SO good and SO easy. I doubled the recipe and used half white, half whole wheat flour. Made the dough the night before (on advice I read in another review) and rolled and baked in the morning. I can't wait to make them again! Oh, I didn't have shortening, so I used butter. Probably made them even yummier. Thanks for the recipe!"
98063,43392,2004-12-15,5,"I love this drink, if only I could have it every day! Made as posted except that I used a cinnamon stick in the juice, rather than cinnamon syrup. It is perfect. I tried to make a low-fat version without much success (used milk, it curdled a bit.) So I'd better not drink it every day, but I'll be making this a lot! Thanks for the recipe."
877892,270800,2010-12-14,5,"My DH is not a big pasta side dish fan and he asked me to make sure I kept this recipe.  I followed the advice of other reviewers, doubled the broth and only added the cream once the rice cooker switched to warm.  The first time I made it I added the cream at the beginning and it boiled all over the counter.  No problems once I made the adjustments.  I also steamed broccoli and added it once the cheese had melted.  Just might be the only way I've ever seen my 82 year old Dad eat broccoli willingly.  Thanks for posting this easy, recipe."

We cooked it up as part of our Thanksgiving feast and intended to have it as an appetizer, but it ended up being served with the turkey and trimmings. These savory-sweet sausage tidbits were a hit! This recipe will be a regular at our holiday table now.  I made another half batch experimenting with browning the sausages slowly over medium heat to render off some of the fat before I mixed in the sauce.  I think I will do it that way next time I make this.  Thanks for sharing your recipe! "

2219045,15345,2012-03-23,5,"I did modify this recipe slightly.  Instead of 1 cup shortening, I split for 1/2C shortening and 1/2C butter.  I wanted more of the melt in your mouth flavor of butter.  Just couldn't imagine a cookie without butter.  The cookies still had that crispy outside and a soft inside.  Made half without any additions and then used mini choc chips and pecan in the other half."
182010,38060,2006-03-29,5,"I did discover after I was home and my pasta was cooking that I had no cilantro--I had fresh mint, parsley and tarragon--so I used a combo of those three harbs with the garlic, lemon and avocado.

I stirred the marinade through the strips and let them sit in the fridge for a few hours. When it came time for dinner, I prepared 270 grams of udon noodles (according to package direction), and set them aside. I then stir-fried 2 cups of broccoli florets and four sliced shallots in 2 teaspoons of peanut oil, and set them aside. I then stir-fried the pork strips for a few minutes. To finish everything off, I added the excess marinade, about 1/4 cup of water and all the other ingredients to the pork strips, and stirred well until heated through.

123521,60403,2004-02-16,1,I would not recommend this recipe to true Fetuccini Alfredo lovers or those who do not like fat free cream cheese. The cream cheese gives the sauce an aftertaste that's hard to swallow.

169430,285802,2008-08-07,4,I love the flavors in this. I made it early in the day and let it chill to go along with bison kabobs and Jasmine rice. I was out of red onion and replaced it with green onion (spring onions) because I thought that the yellows would be too strong. My only complaint about this salad is that there isn't enough dressing mix. I made 2 servings and was measuring in 1/8ths and 1/4's of a teaspoon. As the veggies I used were frozen I just defrosted them and mixed the dressing in a 1 ounce portion cup (with everything mixed is was about 1/4 of an ounce) and poured it on the salad veggies and let them chill most of the day. Thanks Toni for a lovely side dish. Made for Photo Tag.
51129,33102,2003-03-03,5,"This is the best Jambalaya I have ever made! I have to triple the recipe whenever I make it.  Everyone in my family just loves it--We love the flavoring from all the spices, a perfect combination and so easy to make!"
14410,129431,2009-12-19,4,"This smells so good when cooking! I added the zest of the orange, as the other reviewer mentioned, to add even more of that citrus flavor. My slices of French bread were about 5 inches by 3 inches, 3/4 inch thick, and there was only enough liquid for six slices. Maybe I let them soak up too much? I will try this recipe again for sure!"
498271,345806,2013-05-03,5,Great refreshing drink!  Like another reviewer I used curacao instead of the cointreau.  This will be great to enjoy on those hot summer BBQ days - thanks for sharing the recipe!
2000611865,298493,2015-12-15,5,Very easy and delicious!
1641892,357890,2012-04-15,5,This was a quick way to use some of the Kale I blanched and froze last summer.  The wine gave it a nice flavor.  My vegetarian daughter and the meat-eaters in the family all enjoyed it.
1112579,3166,2009-01-04,5,quick and tasty! I altered it a bit. I put Parmesan cheese in the bread crumbs. I also just put a bit of sauce over the top of the chicken then mozzarella cheese. I popped it under the broiler for a minute or two to get it nice and melted.
2002227034,237566,2018-07-23,0,Fabulous. No kool aid crystals in the grocery store where I shop so I used juice crystals and I used less sugar really good ?? ??
1553243,285106,2011-06-05,3,"This is a good recipe.  I would suggest using your own tuna salad recipe and topping with cheese, tomato, and lettuce.  Made for ZWT7.  Thanks for the recipe."
824794,270955,2008-04-24,0,"Absolutely brilliant.  I also did improvise a little by adding some tomatoe puree and reduced Rioja to ""lift the flavours"".

Great !"
242766,280462,2008-04-04,5,"*Made for PAC Spring '08*
Yummy!  We really enjoyed this easy and flavorful bruschetta.  The only change I made was to flip-flop the amounts of basil and oregano (I used 2 TBSP fresh basil and 2 tsp fresh oregano) because we prefer a stronger basil flavor.  The oregano and parmesan cheese made this bruschetta different than most I've had and it was a nice change.  Thank you for sharing this fantastic, easy recipe."
2000257907,82944,2016-10-02,5,Fantastic recipe!! I've made this vegetarian with veggie &quot;beef&quot; crumbles and even the meat eaters loved it!!
625696,71172,2010-01-01,4,"People seemed to either really like or not care for it very much.  Personally, I really liked it!  Its very flavorful.  I stirred some cheese into the cream cheese/sour cream mix, then topped with some more cheese.  I would make it again for myself, just scale it down.  Thanks!"
319609,8423,2007-01-10,3,"I'm sorry to rate this so low, but i followed the directions exactly, and my inside of my pie was just liquid when it was done. I HAD TO DRAIN IT. Thanks though!"
1295837,82594,2009-07-25,5,"WICKED GOOD! thank you so much! i baked these into muffins and gave some on a platter with other items to the local homeless shelter! we loved them and im sure everyone else will too! i did not add cherries, i added currants"
37449,39970,2002-10-12,5,"OOOOH! This was so good! Will be making this again! I didn't have shitake mushrooms, so I just used more of the others. I didn't have red bell pepper, so I just used green, used dried basil instead of fresh, and didn't have wine, so I used grape juice! It still turned out wonderful!"
2001968278,124253,2018-02-02,5,"Added the extra Parm! Yea, I'm a cheese foodie."
2001433727,211225,2017-03-13,5,I loved it!! I ate the whole thing! I just added it to my home cookbook. Only the best of the best recipes go into that and this definitely deserves this priveledge!
209267,22782,2016-08-05,5,"Your spaghetti sauce has become my spaghetti sauce! Thank you for a GREAT recipe! We have been using it for a while now. For my family, we spit it into 3 portions and freeze 2/3 for future dinners. We use it for spaghetti, lasagna, and manicotti; really for anything you would use spaghetti sauce for. Gone are the days of jar spaghetti sauce! The only bad thing is when we run out. That means no spaghetti until I have time to make more."
51546,40430,2002-10-10,5,I also saw this in my newspaper and tried it.  It is so easy and very tasty.  I used low-fat ingredients to make it healthier.  It's definitely a dish that I'll make again!
182809,228642,2007-10-15,5,"Shortcut or not, this turned out really great! I added two extra smashed garlic cloves while cooking and removed before serving, (I love garlic!) and I did use round steak as that is what my daughter-in-law had at her house. This was really easy to make...and I will do it again for my students at home. I personally don't consume beef anymore, but had to have it for taste. Yummy! Think that it can carry more onion, if you like onions! Oh, forgot, didn't use the wine as I didn't want to open a bottle for just 2 tbls full."
1926335,480356,2014-06-23,5,"Loved these, I did use canadian bacon instead of ham - this is a great idea."
2921122,479196,2013-07-28,5,I&#039;ve made this three times already ... it&#039;s awesome. I would tinker with the amount of red pepper flakes because it may be too hot for some. Only problem for me is it is very high in sodium ... I&#039;ll be trying to figure out a way to cut this down. Three thumbs up.
76951,339832,2011-09-07,5,Very good.  I took them to work and got lots of compliments.
339569,305084,2013-07-27,5,Made this with and without sauteing the ham first and it is definately better if you do NOT saute the ham first --- plus do not overcook in oven!
845245,298927,2008-07-07,5,"This is the best roast I have ever had! The meat is so tender and it literally falls apart, in a good way! Thanks for posting this recipe. It is my bf's new favorite recipe."
8688,202902,2007-02-15,4,"We enjoyed this soup very much!  Full of flavor, very filling and satisfying for a winter's evening.  Thank you very much, Lainey!"
245017,17241,2010-08-19,3,"These were good, quick and easy to make. Didn't get much of a reaction from everyone, so probably won't make again, but glad I tried it."
539686,394630,2010-06-06,5,Made for ZWT #6...this is delicious and very easy to make. It's a keeper!
181447,35568,2004-12-29,5,This was very easy and delicious ! My mother in law asked for the recipe and made it the following week. A great holiday desert.
68727,16392,2004-04-19,5,This was very good.  The family really liked this recipe.  I used cooked frozen green beans since I didn't have any fresh.  I was looking for something different to make with green beans and this recipe fit the bill.  Thanks Bergy!
151679,106316,2005-01-27,5,"This was absolutely wonderful! Reminded me of why I love the Iberian Peninsula and the local cooking! I sauted the bacon in slices and then crumbled (easier for me) and chopped the onion really fine. Didn't use the olive oil as the bacon rendered so much fat anyway.  I used port rather than white wine and 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes as well.  Served with potatoes cooked along with the roast, a green vegie, and a salad. Defintly a make again meal."
92816,117424,2011-12-15,5,"I made a couple of changes to this recipe so I guess these would be even better if I went exactly by the recipe.I used margarine instead of butter,next time I'll use butter.I also thought the 1 cup of oil was too much so I reduced it to 3/4 cup.This might be why my dough was kind of dry.But all in all it is still a very tasty cookie.A nice crisp outside but chewy inside."
2704337,245490,2013-03-13,5,Easy and tasted good.
2001416234,369106,2017-03-04,0,"Yay, wash that chicken. Spread that Salmonella around your kitchen!!"
1701927,455672,2012-09-10,0,"Took me a couple of tries to get this just right, but it was quick and easy. It will depend a lot on the power of the microwave & just how done you like your yolks.  Thanks so much for posting!! I will use this often!"
1800209,75758,2011-01-19,5,This recipe is so good! I've never made enchiladas before and this is the one mexican recipe that will always be a hit in my household. Just adjust spiciest to your family's taste! : )
189643,111561,2005-06-21,5,This is a delicious dessert! We used chocolate chip cookies and chocolate ice cream. I froze the cookies and ice cream for an hour and the meringue for 20 minutes. We baked it a little hotter the second time we made this (450 for 3 minutes) and it came out a lot firmer. We'll make this again-it may become a Father's Day tradition! Thanks~
258877,231666,2008-02-27,3,"Ohhhhhhhhhhhh... I found this soooo strong... Even after making 3 months 
ago.  Definitely could not eat it alone..  I had it with ice cream.  Maybe less  vodka or  use a different           alcohol. I'm sure it could be modified  to a more mellow flavour.    All I can say is, thank God you never got caught sneaking this..."
2126389,89204,2012-02-14,5,My family loved this recipe!!! They asked for seconds and when I would make it again. Of course with everything I put my own spin on it with seasonings but it was great!
7888220,278998,2013-08-28,1,"I am so disappointed in this recipe.  Was super excited about it but none of my kids (3) liked it and then I offered it to three neighbor kids and only one liked it.  I have like 20 of these frozen now, and don&#039;t know what I am going to do with them!  :o(  Smoothies???  The only thing I can think of is that I couldn&#039;t find pineapple/orange concentrate and I used regular orange concentrate and my mandarins were in water so I drained them.  Maybe this made the slush too bitter and not sweet enough...."
182010,176253,2006-07-15,5,"So simple and so good!  I skipped the powdered sugar and used low fat sour cream--Delicious, summery tasting little dessert.  Thanks, Mrs. G!"
523494,89751,2007-09-18,5,"This is an easy, flavorful recipe! I used vanilla soy milk instead of half and half without any problems. My batch yielded 22 gorgeous cupcakes that I topped with No Cook Marshmallow Frosting http://www.recipezaar.com/3731. Beautiful and YUMMY!!! THANKS!!!"
192974,146492,2010-12-15,5,"These are a must for Xmas.  I can't find mint chips here so I used a bit of peppermint oil and dark chocolate wafers.  They are addicting, there isnt a little sandwich bag left from the entire box of crackers.  Everyone who tries them walks away with several in their hand."
788414,101585,2009-01-19,5,"Love this!  Use pine nuts.  Usually have chicken broth on hand, so I use that rather than vegetable broth and low-fat feta.  This is such an easy recipe, and the presentation is unique!"
310237,55259,2009-10-18,5,"Deelish! Very easy to make and quite tasty. I used thin sliced chicken breasts to save on time, as well as the following changes; I  used a can of diced tomatoes instead of sun dried because of personal preference. I drained them first so the sauce wouldn't be too watery. I doubled the spinach, as well because we love spinach, and I added four cloves of chopped garlic in step #6.
I will absolutely make this again. The only thing I might change next time would be to use less butter."
88099,310322,2008-09-12,5,"CB you have a real winner here.  Loved the combination of spinach, chicken and cheese and the black beans and corn just added to it.  I didn't used the frozen spinach.  I took a couple of handfulls of fresh spinach and sauted that in a little olive oil with some chopped garlic.  That added a lot of goodness to this dish I think.  DH requested cheese on top while baking and that turned out well too.  Love the dip.  Just Excellent.  Thanks CB  Made for Adopte a Tag '08"
2001887149,512402,2017-12-24,1,"Tried this recipe last night. Doubled it to make two 8x8 pans. Did all my math and measurements correctly. When they first came out of the oven, they looked about right. Then, I followed the directions to put them in my fridge to store them... yeah, no, bad idea. They are now dried up, hard as rocks, and the few places where they are soft they have the texture of Play-Doh. They were only in there overnight for my Xmas eve party today. Bottom line: huge waste of time and money. I'm not happy with this recipe at all."
1905040,155629,2013-02-22,5,"I love this recipe. I used banana strawberry yogurt and a gram cracker crust, with sliced bananas on top. It is so easy and has so many options. I can't wait to make more of these pies with different flavors of yogurt, toppings and with or without crust. Thank you for posting this recipe."
58104,184640,2007-02-13,5,HOT stuff! In heat and taste! I used 2 fresh tomatoes for the canned and used 3 garlic cloves for I didn`t want toss exclude the 1/2. Served the sauce on shrimp and mussles on a bed of lettuce. This makes a lot so cut the recipe down or be prepared to freeze some.
67728,89177,2006-02-13,5,"I loved this soup, which is pretty impressive since I tend to shy away from non-clear soups. I used reduced fat velveeta because I find it easier to deal with in soups than shredded cheese. I used some leftover homemade mole-based enchilada sauce instead of the canned stuff (in fact, I had just enough left for this recipe -- I tend to use soups as a way to clean out the fridge lol). I also added some leftover seasoned shredded chicken (I try to keep shredded chicken in the fridge for miscellaneous quick meals). I left off the tortilla chips and guacamole, but did use dollops of Mexican crema and a bit of the shredded cheese on top. DH didn't enjoy it as much as I did, but he's just weird and picky about soups for some reason lol. It may have been the black beans, because he doesn't care for those, but I love 'em. It's okay, I enjoyed this too much to let his thumbs-down affect my five stars! Maybe next time I'll just make a half-batch for myself and let him fend for himself that night. :)  Thanks for posting!"
230860,277071,2009-11-05,5,Super simple and tastes great!  I changed the amounts to serve 4 and it worked well.  The only thing I used less of was the olive oil... I used maybe half what it called for because it just wasn't necessary.  I also used already cooked shrimp so I wanted to heat it up a little and just sauteed the butter and oregano for a minute and then heated all that up with the shrimp.  And for the feta I used up the last of a few different containers I had and one of them was Lemon Oregano which I think really added that extra something to it.
227607,95937,2007-03-24,5,These were great but kept getting dirt all over them.  I ended up making up the mix and putting in ziploc baggies for the kids.  They loved them.
596440,175482,2009-07-09,5,"Delicious! I added some craisins and didn't salt and pepper it, and it was great. I was pretty wary about the lentils since I don't like salty stuff, but the flavors mixed wonderfully."
253974,344139,2010-03-11,5,"One of my favorites, Chili! Yum Yum! This is great chili! I used yellow and red bell peppers along with the green, since I had them. I also used my recipe forhttp://www.recipezaar.com/Chili-Powder-Blend-221230, and omitted the cumin and chili powder. A very nice chili, full of flavor! Another keeper Andi, thanks for sharing. Made for KK's forum Go For the Green!"
149363,168333,2006-06-08,5,"This was delicious, and so easy! I used brown rice and simply increased the liquid by 1/2 cup and the cooking time by 15 minutes. It worked great and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Thanks for posting!"
1656885,140432,2010-07-23,5,Everyone loved this recipe (even the kids). I served it with mashed cauliflower and it was great. I used a little more tomato sauce than it called for and used cherry tomatoes cut in half. We grilled the fish instead of broiling it and it turned out great. Loved the sauce and I agree that it looks like an impressive dish when you present it on the table. Will make this one again for sure.
58413,8579,2008-08-24,5,"Kelly,
    This was a great recipe!  It has excellent flavor and the roast is so tender it practically fell apart!  Simple to make and I got rave reviews from the family!  We omitted mushrooms because no one in this house likes them.  Thanks for posting a new go to recipe!"
2001938296,82985,2018-02-18,4,"I love the recipe, but it's kinda pointless to do low carb and then use a poison like splenda. May as well use real sugar or cut the sugar altogether."
1072593,374125,2009-12-03,5,"My photo is of a half batch. Whatever you do double or even quadruple to have it on hand to mix with some butter for garlic bread or mashed potatoes. It holds a promise to keep away consumption, scarlet fever or the plague. Made for P-A-R-T-Y Holiday Tag."
42651,102551,2005-10-21,5,"Like EEBRAG could not find black pepper seeds and I substituted 1 tbsp of Grey Poupon mustard ... as I didn't have regular ones either. We loved this! Thank you (again) CHIA ... and EEBRAG, where do I find your FISH HATER'S COOKBOOK?   "
57256,109525,2005-02-19,5,"I ABSOLUTLEY cannot stand ANY fat free mayo product but , this was very good !

I am gonna slather it on everything !! Thanks Shirl ! "
209280,372791,2014-01-12,5,"An excellent, easy-to-follow recipe! I made these for the first time this morning (mid-January, 2014) and threw together a blueberry sauce to go with them. Very nice! I need some practice in getting them thinner but they tasted great.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, and it&#039;s true what one of my old cooking teachers said:  when you make crepes, the first one will always be terrible ... no matter how good you are at making crepes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funny and true!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great dish!"
1418510,386477,2009-10-18,1,"Nasty!  I followed the recipe but mine took forever to ""crisp up"" and the flavor was horrible.  Not worth me tweeking."
217482,83433,2009-03-19,5,Here in Aus we call this damper ;-) But it is an awsome damper!!! YUM!
95743,102228,2006-01-25,5,"This was wonderfully appealing and tasted marvelous. It is perhaps thinner than other chowders but is just fine as is because of all the vegetables and shrimp. I took some other reviewers' suggestions to heart and made my own hashbrowns by cubing and parboiling some potatoes, setting some aside to be fried for a garnish.  I used skim and evaporated milk and fish stock made from shrimp shells rather than the water. I can appreciate why this is your friend's Christmas Eve tradition, Heather."
131126,161336,2006-03-13,5,The flavor in the soup was very nice!  The only things I did differently was to add the coconut instead of discarding and puree the soup with an immersion blender. I then garnished the soup and rice island with cilanto leaves. It made a lovely presentation.  Thank you for a recipe I'm sure to use again and good luck in the contest! 
2691400,37398,2013-02-13,5,these are one of the best cookies i've ever made. i'm going to have to double the recipe the next time i make them which can't be soon enough! talk about gone in a heartbeat- i had to hide some for myself. hats off to you Carrie Ann. Sharona
452355,318992,2012-10-05,5,"I made this rice to accompany a hoisin grilled salmon recipe.  I loved this rice.  DH said he liked it, but thought it was ""too carroty.""  I am overriding him as I thought it was perfect as is and went well with our Asian main dish.  I am adding this to my keeper file.  The ingredients were easily halved to serve 2.  Thanks for posting."
817179,2930,2008-08-05,5,This recipe was great.  It is super easy to prepare and all five kids loved it.
838594,79563,2008-06-29,3,"A good recipe and definitely worth a try if anyone has any doubts.  However, cooked as directed, either the amount of water was too much or the amount of split peas was too little, because I wound up with a watery soup and had to double the cooking time (uncovered) to achieve the right thickness.  I would also edit the recipe and include more specific direction for the amount of ham to be added, instead of suggesting the ham bone scraps.  Each ham bone can be different, so without specifics, each pot of soup can also be different, making it difficult to get the desired result from each person using this recipe."
242288,34372,2006-06-12,3,"I made this for a Sunday dinner and enjoyed it.  I think I was expecting a more traditional cobbler crust (I am from GA), but still enjoyed it.  I liked it more the day after when the flavors settled."
290757,98345,2008-11-01,5,"I made these for an early Canadian Thanksgiving that we had in the US (we are recent transplants).  They were a great success.  Hubby always tells me I shouldn't make new recipes for company, but I do anyway!  They are a bit of work and I wish that my wonton wrappers were a bit bigger, but they tasted great!"
250422,152144,2006-06-14,5,"Last night I made it with non-fat sour cream and eyeballed the butter. I only used one pound of tofu and I served it on whole wheat rotelli noodles.

311003,333493,2009-01-30,5,"This recipe was included in Book#228608.  November 15, 2008 -- This dish is definitely a keeper. I love turnips, although my son doesn't; he enjoyed this very much and I told him after dinner that this not only had potatoes, but also had turnips in it. He said ""well I guess they're not so bad after all."" DH and I loved the combo of the turnips and potatoes; a little extra zing that made this stand out from the usual homefries. A winner in our household for sure."
217226,76294,2005-12-22,5,"These are a good cookie, and I didn't have any problems with them at all - they weren't too difficult to work with straight out of the refrigerator like others said they were. I found it easier to work with the dough in small portions at a time, and wound up with about 68 cookies. I rolled the dough out pretty thin, but they kind of puffed up a little so that worked just fine, and the flavor was good."

309526,66103,2009-02-20,5,"Lovely!!  I had never made flounder before and this was better, IMHO, than any restaurant treatment of that fish. I served this with roasted asparagus (olive oil and Montreal steak seasoning) and we thought the flavors were amazing!  Thank you MrsEl for a wonderful treat!"
52543,61548,2003-12-16,5,This was excellent - the flavour reminded me of Creamsicles which were my favourite ice cream bar when I was a kid! Both the cake and the frosting were light and not too sweet. Thanx Kittencal Bass! 
301443,23762,2008-07-05,4,"If you like Apricots you'll love this bread.  I'm not huge on the taste because i'm not an apricot lover but the almonds and the cinnamon were a perfect addition.  I followed recipe exactly and had no problem with the consistency or the time it took to cook.  I put the batter in 3 mini pans and it took about 50 minutes to cook instead of the 60 and it came out just fine.  I may make this again if I can get my kids to eat it and if I do so I'll dice the apricots up in finer pieces.  Also use ripe apricots mine were just too sour.  Also, don't cut down on time by not toasting the almonds.  I loved them toasted in this recipe"

2001518204,417354,2017-05-02,5,This was delicious! Thank you so much for the recipe! I only baked mine for 35 minutes because I used a larger pan. Love this. Will make again!

60486,182575,2009-03-11,4,"Good the next day, allowing the flavors to meld and develope and the sauce to thicken. There was the hint of guiness bitterness. The maple flavour wasn't noticable. Reduced recipe by half as I'm used to baked bean recipes making huge amounts, but this is actually a small recipe to begin with. Soaked beans for 12 hours. Used guiness beer. Subbed jacob cattle beans, yellow mustard. Had no bacon but wanted a bit of flavor so used 5 drops of hickory smoke. Added 3 cups water. Cooked in a crockpot on high for 8 hours. Took the cover off checking them a few times, next time will not do that and check after 6 hours.  Oops, forgot to add salt. Served with recipe #14988."
98394,68605,2003-08-22,5,"Very good and tasty.  
To reduce fat content, I used the soy chorizo and used a little of the queso fresco and used white soy cheese for the rest.  
I had to add a lot of extra flour to the dough. We have been eating whole wheat so the white flour tasted like cake.  The next time I make this I will used half whole wheat flour in the dough.
This will make good lunches to take to work. "
4470,93018,2009-05-24,5,Great recipe Tasty & Healthy. I used cod and omitted the tomatoes. I added tomato to my arugula salad.  Grilled the skewers on my griddler.  They were wonderful
29196,199251,2011-05-05,5,"Peggy,you know the recipe that morphed from cold to hot, well, it morphed back to a cold recipe again. I marinated and cooked enough chicken for the two of us in enough marinade for 4, chopped enough salad veg (which I didn't cook and included a carrot) for 4, heated up enough noodles for 2 (then cooled them under cold water) and poured over enough sauce for 4 (have I lost you yet?). Well the end result was almost the best dish I've cooked in ages. This is so yummy, if I had to pick a dish I had to eat for the rest of my life, I'd seriously consider this one!! I did add ina garlic clove to the sauce."
124449,88304,2004-10-08,5,"My mother (who grew up in Kansas) used to make these and they are absolutely wonderful!  Instead of the hot roll mix or the ""from scratch"" recipe included with this recipe, you can use frozen bread dough balls.  Thaw the rolls, then roll out individually to about 1/8 inch thick and proceed as detailed in the recipe.  Many, many thanks for posting this!"
437991,371153,2009-05-12,5,"DH said: This is the most beatiful and best meal you cooked since a long time. It was new and fresh and as I believe I cook pretty good every time, this is 5 stars straight.
Enjoyed for ZWT5"
350540,90198,2010-07-21,5,Great recipe.  Very tasty and very easy to make.
52282,53106,2003-02-11,4,"delicious condiment, i served this alongside shredded flank steak. a nice change from the usual."
1091857,396284,2013-10-07,4,I would skip the mash potatoes.
1578444,83789,2014-05-12,5,"I just made this for mother&#039;s day. I used a frozen 9&#039; deep dish shell, 2 cups of last years frozen rhubarb, frozen and fresh strawberries + extra, 6 heaping T. of flour, 1/2 cup sugar. The crumb crust was good. I let it set overnight in the refridgerator. Yum!"
2000614004,33921,2015-10-28,5,"thank you! i doubled the recipe. increased the moisture content with extra tomato basil sauce and a bit of pesto (as i added a small amount of gluten free bread crumbs to make up for the lack of seasoning i had on hand). moist ingredients including lentils blended in the vitamix. also included a can of corn. i think i prefer the flavor the next day, cold, with ketchup...here&#039;s to hoping my vegetarian boyfriend appreciates it! thanks again!"
179133,210671,2007-08-02,5,Very tasty combination! I used a regular sandwich bun instead of the rye as it was what I had on hand. Thanks for the yummy and different sandwich idea Lori!
5672,22866,2004-04-13,5,"I just fixed this for Easter Dinner and our son who really didn't like Ham loved this.
It was a refreshing change from the everyday ham with pineapples.
It's a keeper recipe!
The glaze was great but I couldn't find all the ingredients needed so I had to fudge it a bit."
424680,113891,2008-05-10,5,"I have no idea what authentic English Custard should taste like, but I made this recipe to serve with another recipe of English origin, & those two recipes made for a very, very nice taste experience! Will be keeping your custard recipe on hand! Thanks for sharing!"
2000323602,22421,2015-12-22,5,This was excellent. I would not change anything! Perfect every time I&#039;ve made it!
373495,318298,2009-07-07,5,"Yummy!  I just love fresh basil.  Very easy, light, and tasty.  I will scale back on pepper next time, it sort of stole the show from the tomatoes and basil."
188475,163788,2007-02-23,5,I had never made gravy before and this was simple and easy. Plus it was all ingredients I always keep on hand. Will definately make this again but will add more spices and/or worcestershire. I only added salt and pepper and hubby thought it was a little bland.
226316,51792,2007-05-16,5,"I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner, and it was great! Very refreshing, not as heavy as the usual pecan pie.  Thanks for posting."
482933,8753,2008-11-04,5,"Wow!  Delicious and moist.  I did not have honey mustard dressing so just added 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise and mustard which curdled- next time I would just put in mustard.  There was lots of sauce which maybe could be reduced to half if you did not plan on using--say over rice?   Also, when we make this again we will put it in an aluminum foil container-the tin foil approach was pretty flimsy. Thanks Major Woods for posting.  Made for My-3-Chefs '08."
286851,124093,2008-03-31,4,"We enjoyed these chops very much. I liked how easy they were to put together and how few ingredients it takes to make them. Even my two little picky eaters enjoyed them. Served with a salad, mashed potatoes and peas. A great weeknight meal that I'm sure will go into the regular rotation. Thanks for sharing!"
1203769,126611,2010-01-25,4,"I've been making this salad for at least 10 years (well, a very similar version) and it's very very good. I didn't change much. I use red, yellow, and orange bell peppers instead of green to add some color, and I've never ever added additional oil - I actually can't imagine what that would do other than make it greasy. I also use fresh mozzarella. I never add rotini - just up the tortellini - beautiful. I'm surprised that no one has mentioned that the pesto turns brown after it's sat for a while. Tastes amazing, just doesn't always *look* so great. I've used different brands - even made my own - and it always turns. If anyone has a trick to keep it green, I'd love it! Great great recipe - try it!!"
2000391889,1356,2016-08-31,5,I have made these twice and they are wonderful! Both times I used the exact ingredients and &quot;eyeballed&quot; the measurements. I would highly recommend mixing the cheese into the rice/tomato/meat mixture near the last few minutes of the simmer. It really helps the peppers not rely on just the cheese on the top :)
316809,84748,2009-01-17,5,"Just made this tonight...YUMMY! I used a low fat granola with raisins, otherwise I followed the recipe. No else had a chance to have any, but I'm positive they'll like it. I'm going to use it tomorrow to make the cinnamon toast my son loves. The granola and brown sugar should go well with the cinnamon. Thanks for posting another great recipe!"
1235341,150473,2009-04-11,5,great
302094,24044,2009-04-02,5,"Simply wonderful soup! I finally used my ham bone from christmas for this soup and I am so glad I chose this soup. My husband usually dreds when I make split pea but not this time he loved the addition of the bacon. I didn't add but a sprinkling of salt because ham & bacon have enough salt content for us. Everyone loved it, thanks so much for posting Bev!"
2709535,496805,2013-03-11,5,"Very flavorful steak and potato recipe.  Ingredients so easy to assemble for a delicious, hearty dish."
383346,446365,2011-08-20,4,I didn't care for this couscous at all.  DH liked it a little bit more.  What we didn't like is the raw garlic.  I'll have to try this recipe again but maybe add the garlic to the water in the beginning.  That way it would cook a little bit.  Or omit the garlic.  Cause the sriracha and parmesan makes it good.  Thanks LunarMystic :)  Made for Cookbook tag game
177135,37042,2005-05-11,5,I tried this last night and.....yum !!  Very easy to make....and totally delicious !  The cheese mixed with the breadcrumbs turned out great.....It was gobbled up in no time.  I'll definitely make this again.....Thanks for sharing !
452355,244093,2008-12-20,5,"DH and I made this linguine for lunch today.  It is very rich and really delicious.  We liked how fast and easy it was to prepare.  I used about 16 oz of button and portabella shrooms, as that it what I had on hand and it seemed like it was plenty.  We'll definitely have this again when we are in need of a quick to fix, tasty lunch.  Thanks!"
114259,13332,2003-12-23,1,"I am a  mexican woman and i would not say this is the traditional way to make""real tamales.I would recommend that you try Karens recipe#15286 this is a bit more traditional."
359936,366040,2010-04-05,5,"FABULOUS! I used fresh orange juice that I juiced from oranges in our CSA weekly basket. This recipe was pretty easy to make, and the mix before freezing was just like an orange julius. Everyone raved over it and will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
2002282192,209764,2018-09-23,1,"I must have done something wrong because this tasted horrible. I used Namaste Foods Perfect Flour Blend. I doubled the recipe and split evenly between two 9&quot; round pans. It wasn't dry, but it was chewy and tastes like cardboard. The only person that liked it was the gluten free birthday girl. The rest of us couldn't eat more than one or two bites. I was so bummed."
405751,122481,2007-04-02,5,This recipe was absolutely fabulous.  Everyone loves it.  Very rich and smooth
774665,82077,2009-08-23,5,"This is going in our regular rotation. I served it with lemon rice and string beans. It was a simple yet delish meal. Thanks! I only marinated it for three hours and that was plenty, so it's still a great recipe for those of us that don't always plan ahead."
2119120,229275,2011-12-23,4,"Creamy and delicious, a nice ratio of elements. The next time I make this, (which will probably be soon!) I would change a few bits. I'd substitute the cayenne with black pepper. I'd throw in just a pinch of the cayenne. I'd add garlic, and a little tomato paste like one of the other reviewers suggested. (great idea!)<br/><br/>All in all, very nice. We had this with a sourdough loaf and it was so delicious, I was bummed to see my bowl empty so fast! <br/><br/>I used a 1/2 pound of dungeness crab. I omitted the sherry. Added an extra tbsp butter."
31316,30277,2002-07-02,5,"Oh, this was good!  My kids have asked me to make again.  Thanks for sharing!"
1153793,29679,2009-09-01,5,"I definitely think these taste like peanut butter eggs..not so much just like a Reese's...but for sure JUST AS GOOD!!! :)  I cut the recipe in half b/c I didn't want to eat it all by myself.  Which I am hoping no one else in my family likes them so I can keep them all but I doubt that will happen.  I have a lot of meetings to go to for my husbands deployment and I am always searching for easy but amazing things to bring and I think I found my next star :)  I pulled it out at 20 minutes and did like a rough cut and made 25 squares in a 8 x 8 pan, then 10 minutes later went back in and re cut and they were perfect.  I am definitely going to try what someone suggested by spreading a layer of chocolate on the bottom and letting it harden then putting the peanut butter mixture on top.  I am also going to throw in some coconut next time b/c they make me think of the pb egg we always ate as kids!  Thanks for this great recipe!"
199213,195130,2007-02-13,5,"I wish, I could give this 6 stars,
the smell while cooking had neighbors coming over to see what we were cooking. Tasted just as great as it smelled, next time will try different kinds of squash, I loved the fennel. Thanks French Tart."
62085,43663,2004-02-22,5,"This is an easy to prepare and very delicious salad. I enjoyed the flavor of the combined ingredients, especially the olives.
I served it over a small bed of salad greens along with stuffed celery sticks and cucumbers. Thanks a bunch for the recipe.
"
59064,55777,2005-01-12,5,"Excellent easy recipe that is quite filling. I used thai basil, homemade ricotta and a green bell pepper but it still looked pretty good. Tastes delicious too."
992411,288287,2008-10-16,4,"This was an excellent dish and has a future as a ""company"" dinner. I followed the directions as written with just a little jalapeno tossed in. However, next time I would do it in a single layer. I think it would be nice to have that good cheese topping on all of the breasts rather than the top few. I'd probably increase the liquid to be sure it was still ""saucy"" and not dry.
I also served it with a spicy Mexican rice.
Definitely a keeper."
324390,452971,2011-04-13,5,I loved this. The spice made my house smell wonderful. Thank you for the recipe.
223456,32204,2007-10-14,5,"AWESOME!  Never, EVER use a mix again !  These are just too easy and so moist.  PERFECT........"
45507,23706,2009-10-24,5,Loved these.  Better than the recipe w/ 3 cups Bisquick.  I used a cheddar/garlice biscuit mix and even added a little extra garlic.  Really good.
724516,226695,2010-11-10,5,"Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! I love this kind of bar cookie, so tasty and you get a good chew with all the nuts and fruit. The nuts I used were chopped hazel nuts and chopped walnuts. the fruit was a mix of cranberries, raisins and currents, to use up my fruit from the larder, everything else was as the recipe required. I baked it for exactly 25 minutes. they are very quick to make and so easy, a good one for the kids under supervision when you get to the oven bit. Thank you for posting a smashing recipe. Made for diabetes month November 2010"
37636,72722,2004-12-30,5,"I am putting in a new review on this since I made this again. The recipe has been changed from the last time I made it, so anyone who has this printed out may want to check to make sure they have an updated copy. The last time I made this, it was a disaster- the oven temp called for was way too high and subsequently, the squash burnt pitch black on the undersides. I could not eat that then, so I had to give a low review. But I have made this at the new oven temp (350F) and this recipe works out quite well. I like the savory taste the soy gives the squash, and it goes together very well. It is a little messy to eat trying to get the peel off, but it is definitely worth it. I am glad I gave this recipe a second chance and would happily make it again. Thanks for posting!"
991820,147785,2010-11-02,4,Very good!!!
292021,147033,2006-02-08,4,"I like this recipe. I used enova oil instead of Canola oil and 1/2% regular milk instead of soy. The real reason I used this recipe is because I was out of butter but still wanted to make some type of chocolate  chip cookie. I baked them at 350 degrees in my convection oven, for about ~15 minutes. I probably could have taken them out earlier, but I was unsure how they would turn out. Beware, they do not end up very brown, but rather a very light color. Next time I will take them ou The top and edges are hard but yet the ""bottom"" and inside of the cookie are soft. The flavor is pretty good...I might try cinnamon next time. "
222564,380319,2017-03-14,5,"Tasty one, really nice flavours! I used only 4 lb potatoes."
724997,80413,2011-02-15,5,"I LOVE this!  I have used it 5 or 6 times now for buns, and dinner rolls!  I will NEVER buy buns from the store again!"
2000487509,459783,2015-09-20,5,Quick and easy!Turns out great if you add some chilli powder!
1505069,28768,2010-06-13,4,I thought it was really good.  Next time I would double the cottage cheese/ricotta mixture.  And 1/2 lb less meat.  I thought it was too much meat and not enough cheese. But it tastes very good still.
102058,221952,2007-04-22,5,"5 stars! I also couldn't find bamboo shoots and the bag of mixed peppers that DH bought only yesterday had green ones that he hadn't noticed were mouldy so I was restricted to the good ones, namely red and yellow. The yield is small, it was two decent servings for a main meal for two people (mind you we didn't bother adding rice) and I slowly sauted my cashews for about 10 minutes in 1 T olive oil, until they were devinely toasted.  I added some during the last minutes of cooking and sprinkled the rest on top. Like you I found the peanut oil to be a lot so used homemade chicken stock also in the interests of cutting down fat. I added some zucchini and it was wonderfully tasty. Please see my rating system: 5 wonderful stars for an easy to throw together meal that tastes excellent. Thanks!!!"
194035,46596,2005-02-07,5,"Superb!  Subbed salsa casera for ro-tel.  Don't care much for ro-tel's flavor.  It rocked.

Great submission"
86512,16531,2003-10-07,4,"This was really good. As suggested by other reviewers, I cut down on the brown sugar and vinegar by half. I used Rice Vinagar. It was still slightly too sweet for me. I didn't taste any of the garlic in it either. I think next time I make it, I will add some Thyme leaves to it and see if that makes a difference. If it does I will review the recipe again. "
408752,27208,2008-12-29,5,This was so easy to make and the flavor was amazing! I did use half the packets to reduce the sodium and bought a very cheap roast beef. I will def make this again.
4470,38258,2006-11-26,5,Definately 5 stars - Delicious adult sloppy joe that has great flavor - I was generous with the hot sauce. - The peppers give it some crunch & the papper flakes kick it up a notch.  I cut the recipe back to one serving with no problem.  I took the liberty of adding a slice of light cheese for the last few minutes on the pan. I enjoyed your recipe very much - Tell Gail she is a very good sloppy Joe maker
424680,370734,2009-07-20,5,"This makes for a very tasty chicken dish, but then I like almost anything with OJ! Made this as indicated (although I did double the amount of sesame seeds) & served it with a combo brown rice & peas! Thanks much for posting this great recipe! [Tagged, made & reviewed in the Unrated Asian Recipe Tag Game]"
335520,170695,2006-08-08,3,"Wooha, that's hot stuff! I put in half of the red peper flakes called for in the recipe, and by the end of a serving I could breathe fire. However, with the amendment of much less red pepper, I will gladly make this dish again. The crunch of the fresh veggies, and soothing mushiness of the chickpeas and the cooling creaminess of the yogurt mixture  make for a very pleasing dish. Even my meat loving other half agrees we can do this again. "
116371,78954,2004-02-26,4,I am not a red sauce lover but my family is.  We all enjoyed it very much.  I think in the future I may not put in as much honey or just add more wine!  Very good though!
314579,138810,2017-08-15,5,"These are terrific! I chopped them a little smaller because I like your idea of putting the mushrooms on crusty bread! I think next time I'll chop them even smaller for appetizer. I'll leave them bigger for a side dish. Thanks Lauralie for posting this! Stacy G, CQ 2017, Wales"

I only made a half a batch.
Thanks."
1803712418,231910,2015-01-27,0,I loved this BUT my banana&#039;s turned black during cooking. What do you think could have caused this? Not that it bothered ME but I wouldn&#039;t serve it that way to family or friends. Ripeness of bananas?
780172,449070,2012-04-01,5,"My mom use to make this for me as a child, so had to make it again. I can not have cheese so I skipped the cheese step."

724631,380612,2009-08-01,4,"4.5 stars by a family vote.  The topping was very tasty and very easy; one child served himself a cloud topped by strawberry slices (skipping the cake) -- I think he had the best idea.  There was no angel food cake available, so I used Hostess shortcakes with the indented top; adults only needed one for their dessert, two layers were redundant.  I used Strawberry-flavored Cool Whip, which had a soft pink color, perfect for this dish.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, gailanng!  Made for Please Review My Recipe."
837251,171378,2008-06-16,4,"Thanks to this recipe i'll be making pork chops more often.
I had to use red wine instead of white, because i drank the last glass of white the night before, oops! lol. It tasted fine however. I used my pork spice mix instead of salt and pepper, those spices went really well with the rest.

117075,78589,2003-12-14,4,thanks! that was easy and fun and the tarts were delicious.
209318,338863,2009-06-23,4,Pretty good burgers. Great base recipe. Next time I'll add different (and more) spices next time.
346662,2925,2007-10-18,5,This is the best apple  crisp looks and taste great.
900992,181477,2010-08-06,2,Something about this didn't work properly. It was in the oven baking for about 2 hours and it *still* didn't cook through. The oven's fine... it's not the oven. Maybe this needs more flour or something.
1660864,265192,2010-08-02,5,easy and fast. yummy!:P
222564,344392,2010-04-19,5,So yummy and easy. Mexican stuffed chiles without breading.
237655,55822,2006-05-03,4,"I used white whole wheat flour as I ran out of regular white flour!(How can it be, I don't know...) But I creamed the butter with sugar by the time I realized it so I took a chance. Then, I misread the directions and I baked it in the round 9 inch pan... Well, it still came out good - I had to bake it 40 minutes or so, however."

733842,147812,2011-01-10,3,"Just ok. I don't think my mango was big enough. I found my smoothie lacking in mango flavor but the candied ginger goes nicely. I might make it again but not add the ice and substitute the water for milk. I think the water and ice dilute the wonderful mango flavor. I live in a rural area so I don't get mangos a lot, now I wish I had just eaten the mango plain. Hope this helped you."
10033,32495,2005-04-16,5,"Loved this crust for Bert's Strawberry Pie. I loved the addition of the oats. This was by far the best graham cracker crust I've ever made--I usually don't make them because I hate how they turn out. Not this one! Loved how substantial and sturdy it was., Thanks S'kat! "
79737,122464,2006-02-22,0,"I honestly don't know what to rate this recipe. I made it for my brother-in-law's birthday but didn't want to serve it -- in fact, when my husband brought it out, I warned everyone to sample it at their own risk. Everyone raved about the taste. Where the problem lies is with the directions. I followed the recipe exactly, but I too had problems with the two layers ""melting"" together into a big mushy mess, even after I made sure everything was cooled. It almost seemed as if the second ""cheesecake"" layer didn't set up enough, even though I didn't dare bake it any longer in the oven as the edges were starting to brown. IF I tried this recipe again, I think that I would try only 1 egg in the cheesecake layer to see if that would remedy the mushiness. Perhaps this didn't turn out due to my inexperience as a cook, but I guess I would give the recipe 5 stars based on taste but only a 2 or 3 for the actual recipe itself -- which doesn't even state to refrigerate in order for the strawberry/jello layer to set. "
354465,137970,2007-03-03,3,I would agree with another person that said these didn't taste like smores but more like choc. chip muffins. I was a bit dissapointed because all the marshmallows rise to the top and the choc. chips sink to the bottom. They tasted good but just not like I expected them to.I realized after I had already started making these I didn't have vanilla yogurt so I just omited the yogurt and increased the milk to 1 cup. Worked out just fine. They were very moist. I baked them at 350' for about 17-18 minutes and they were perfect. They were kid friendly too. Thank's!
173495,170737,2006-08-29,3,"Sorry, but I found this to be rather blah. I added more onion and a couple cloves of garlic and still thought it was way to bland.My DH thought we were having broccoli soup and said he couldn't tell the difference. This is just my taste so in its favor, it was easy to make with easy to follow directions and really I think most people would like it. Thank you, Bayhill for sharing."
1688531,438760,2010-11-11,5,"This was great! My daughter nad I had this on a cold night, I did not have a muffin pan, so I used Custard Cups 10 oz. Oval instead. They were perfect. I finally got myself the muffin pan. I will try to use that instead."
60385,46354,2003-10-28,5,"This turned out to be a good, hearty, healthy stew. The combination of vegetables was slightly different from what I have used in stews I have made in the past, but I definitely liked the combination. The meatballs were easy to make and had good flavor from the worcestershire sauce. My kids and husband thought it was good too. Thanks Nurse Di."
189217,56762,2005-02-14,5,Very good Lemon taste and very moist.
150281,179211,2007-09-11,5,"BLUE ROSE - I want to kiss you!
This was FANTASTIC! It was a big hit with everyone here. The smell when it was cooking was heavenly. The ease of making it was excellent and the clean up...well took 2 mins. Almost a perfect meal.

We loved the flavors, the lamb was so tender and flavorful. I put the salt and pepper on the meat and potatoes, then layered the rest on top. Otherwise made it completely as directed. This goes directly into my favorites cookbook.
PAC-FALL07 review. Thank you for posting this one!!"
494867,170613,2011-09-04,5,"This one is a keeper! I don't know why I don't make brussels sprouts more often -- it's probably bad childhood memories...  BUT this recipe will win you over, it's excellent! And easy! Make this!"
450004,318931,2008-09-19,4,"We really enjoyed these cookies! They were soft and cake-ish, but still very much a cookie..if that makes sense. Lol I added 1TB of cocoa instead of the 2 tspn, and cooked them for about 15 minutes. We enjoyed them with our afternoon coffee, thanks for sharing! [Made & reviewed as a thankyou for reviewing one of my recipes :)]"
281701,177558,2008-06-24,5,"Wonderful corn!!  Even my corn-snob hubby thought it was terrific!  We might not ever have it any other way either!  So, so easy and the silks husks just come right off.  LOVE IT!  Thank you so much for posting this!  Your ZWT4 CAFE ZMAAK Gypsies teammate!!"
104295,137036,2005-11-18,4,We were mixed here.  I liked it but the rest of the family found it way too tart.  Interesting flavor and I'm glad I tried it.  
158086,55514,2010-04-19,5,This is the first time I have ever made homemade blue cheese dressing....I cannot believe how good this is compared to the brand I usually buy...The only think I changed is used splenda for the sugar and Lowfat may and sour cream....love love love it...
592157,233138,2008-08-28,5,We will double the recipe next time. Very good!
64682,26769,2004-02-10,5,Easy no fuss recipe that produced a very tasty and moist chicken breast.  I had some difficulty getting the onions to adhere to the breast during the preparation but just piled the onions on and tossed the dish in the oven.  We all enjoyed the dinner.
2597942,395643,2014-05-11,5,"I made this popcorn snack this afternoon to take to the neighbors cook-out / bon-fire this evening. It was quite easy to put together and the flavor was great! I made as directed, except I did the same as another reviewer and used white chocolate since I couldn&#039;t find almond bark in our local grocery store. Everyone at the cook-out enjoyed these. I will definitely be making this again (especially at the holidays). Thanks for posting. (Made for PAC 2014)"
877233,149043,2013-02-02,5,"Really great and simple. Used fresh minced garlic, sliced baby bellas and dried chives (wish I'd had fresh, but still very good.) Thanks, Janice!"
1007609,99979,2008-11-11,5,"OK, I substituted so many things in this recipe it probably qualifies as a new recipe, but I started here so here it is.
First, I used Tilapia instead of Orange Roughy because that is what I had. I wanted to cut the fat and calories as much as possible and changing the butter for olive oil as baezus suggested was not enough for me, so instead I used butter flavored Pam spray. I sprayed the baking dish, placed the Tilapia side by side and then sprayed the Tilapia. Sprinkled the basil on top and put in broiler. After turning I sprayed and sprinkled again. 
I am not fond of lemon on my food, so I did something else baezus suggested was to use white wine instead. Good tip! 
Lastly was the cheese. I found a bag of Kraft Natural Shredded Fat Free Mozzarella and had to give it a try. Glad I did. It worked great. 
After substituting so many things, I think I accomplished what I was after, a very low fat meal. I may have even cut the calories too, although they were low to begin with. I like a bit more seasoning on my food so I sprinkled some Everglades Seasoning on after the fact and it gave it the finishing touch. I served it with a mix of vegetables.
Even though I changed it a bit, this was a good recipe that provided me with a base to start by and adapted well with my needs. It was quick and not very difficult for a beginner cook such as me. It deserves 5 stars in my opinion."
679759,216377,2008-04-21,5,"I didn't line the bowl with the strawberries and kiwi - I chopped them both in decent sized chunks and made them a layer....I used pound cake instead of angel food as I prefer how much more ""stable"" it is in a trifle.  So I layered cake, banana and pineapple, then whipped mixture then strawberry kiwi mixture then repeated it again.  This is so good and all the fruit is a real treat!  Served it for 16 dinner guests and they all raved about it!"
305531,326490,2008-10-08,5,Yum! I made this as directed and it would be great to sip while watching it rain outside. Thanks HeidiRenee. Made for PAC Fall 2008.
644902,307724,2008-07-05,4,This was a prefectly wonderful dish that I added to our seafood buffet yesterday - the seasoning just about dead on - I added a little garlic and lemon butter on the side for those that wanted to crank it up a notch and it seemed that most did so I perhaps next time I would add a clove of mashed garlic to the herb mixture and throw in a few lemon slices - made for zingo 2008
1216422,44888,2012-01-22,5,"So good! Very simple to prepare as well. I had only the about half the proper amount of honey, so I substituted some brown sugar and syrup for the remainder. I used a teaspoon of minced garlic, and turned about three times during the cooking process. It smelled great while cooking, tasted delicious and didn't take much time."
460301,14526,2007-03-17,5,"My kids love this, especially with sliced strawberries."
88099,313251,2009-08-30,5,Skipped breakfast today so made this up for my lunch.  The flavors were so good.  And this is so easy to put together.  I didn't have the sugar free stuff so not as guiltless for me.  Thanks CB  Made for Holiday Tag :)
217964,139470,2005-11-18,5,"Excellent!

I added a little Cap'N Crunch cereal to it as well to add a little bit of a sweet taste.  Very good!
Easy to make!

:)

"
302689,33921,2009-01-29,5,I have tried so many vegetarian meatloaves and been disappointed but this one was really good. My only concern was a personal preference against basil so next time I will reduce the amount in this recipe. WELL DONE!
1269563,185709,2010-05-10,5,"This is absolutely delicious. After I strained my 2 cups of juice for the jelly, I removed the orange rind from the remaining rhubarb pulp, added 2 cups of sugar to the pulp, and made 4 pints of rhubarb orange sauce in addition to the 5 cups of jelly from the juice. I processed the pints of sauce in a hot water bath for 15 min."
302689,15068,2010-03-27,5,"As I started to make these I got very concerned... How was something that was so easy to put together ever going to be good enough to impress my dinner guests... But when I took my mixture out of the fridge and had a taste, I knew I had no reason to be concerned and I was right. Every one of my guests loved these, many asking for the recipe! I used the food processor method (super easy) and made a half batch. The only ingredient change I made was to use a vegan butter substitute. Thanks for an awesome recipe!"
89831,196098,2007-10-28,5,"easy and so tasty, I used cherry tomatoes that I had frozen in my freezer from my summers crop and also added in 2 tablespoons fresh garlic and 1 teaspoon crushed chili flakes, I let mine simmer for about 1 hour then served over rigatoni pasta for a wonderful weekend lunch my DS enjoyed, thanks for sharing hon!...Kitten:)"
591314,218343,2009-03-13,5,"The flavor of this chowder is so delicious!  It is nice and thick with ingredients and the broth has so much flavor, I found myself spooning out the broth to eat first!  You can thicken it if you like, but I prefer it just the way it is!  I used salt pork instead of the bacon and it made it taste so yummy! DH suggested that I make this again next week he liked it so well!"
907114,207870,2011-03-27,5,Great recipe. Easy enough to make. I took my time making the sauce slowly caramelizing the tomatoes for that rich taste. Topped it with dried oregano for that added rustic aroma.
64154,20773,2005-11-07,5,"I haven't had soft boiled since I was wrestleing in high school over 30 years ago. One of the diet recipes were soft boiled eggs over puffed rice. Of course, coach's recipe didn't include butter.
I made these eggs and mixed them with puffed rice. Thanks for the wonderful recipe and memories."
424680,370549,2009-08-02,5,"Usually when I see cayenne pepper I want to reduce the amount, but for this recipe I didn't & was very happy that I'd followed the ingredients exactly ~ VERY, VERY TASTY TREATS that disappeared in no time at all! This is definitely a keeper of a recipe & these crispies made a great new addition to my finger food counter! Thanks, much, for posting the recipe! [Tagged, made & reviewed in 1-2-3 Hit Wonders tag]"
707272,72420,2007-12-29,5,"This recipe has become our holiday standard. I tried it last year and searched for ages before I found it again this year - so thankful I found it! I substitute Poultry Seasoning for the spices - it comes out beautifully. I also use Portabella mushrooms in place of regular mushrooms, and spicy Italian pork sausage instead of mild. I also find that adding raw celery pieces gives it a very nice satisfying crunchy texture (use 1/2 celery as per recipe, add in the other half when combining ingredients). As someone diagnosed with Celiac disease in early adulthood I always felt deprived that I couldn't have the traditional bread stuffing. Most years I would indulge and just suffer afterwards. I finally stumbled upon this recipe which I used in the neck cavity (just use more wild rice instead of breadcrumbs), bread stuffing in the larger cavity for everyone else. It turns out this is such a hit that now this is all we use!"
41480,11923,2002-05-28,5,Great recipe.  I poured off a lot of the bacon grease and used brown mustard.  Turned out great! Thank u!
2000145969,193871,2015-04-17,5,"I double the recipe using  1 -1/4 cup whole milk, 2 cups van Soy milk instead of 4 cups of milk.  Added a splash of vanilla and two table spoons of sugar.  Replaced veg oil with 1/2 cup of melted butter.  Now they are The best waffles ever."
607820,150023,2008-12-29,5,"Really, really liked this recipe.  I used French's Horseradish mustard instead of Dijon and it was superb.  Made to go along with sausage balls but will use for many more things.  Thanks."
2556377,192669,2012-12-11,1,"Authentic Guyanese pepperpot does not contain onions, garlic, thyme or bayleaf.  Those ingredients completely change the flavor of the dish.  The Amerindians never use them.  The meat is seasoned with the salt and cassareep only and sugar is added to taste."
464080,157032,2014-04-30,5,"Moist?  Yes. Tasty?  Yes.  Easy?  Yes.  Score!  I put mine on a rack on top of my cast iron baker which I filled with carrots and broccoli to roast as a side.  After 35 minutes on 400 everything was cooked perfectly.  I agree that you need some sort of a dipping sauce if you put on the breadcrumbs with a heavy hand (as I do), however next time I will just do a light coating of crispy on the outside and see what happens."
1517611,20668,2010-01-10,5,an excellent blend of flavour for such a simple recipe. I used a sweet potatoe instead of a regular potatoe. It was absolutely declicious and had a warm fall color to it. Will make it all winter long!
2359448,373600,2016-01-26,5,"As a souffle junkie, I dreamed about making one quicker and in one vessel. . .a &quot;skillet&quot; version.  This morning I woke up and Googled it&#039;s possibility. Sure enough. There it was! Although I still love the eloquence of the dish version, it was fun to make and cut the work time down significantly. 
A wonderful recipe I&#039;ll make again. Thank you!"
1670583,12794,2012-05-30,5,What a delicious recipe. I am so glad I tried it last night and everyone loved it. Thanks for sharing!
35526,50797,2003-08-13,5,"I salted the rim with Kosher salt and garnished with a pickled green bean, just like in New Orleans.  WOW, great way to get the wasabi mixed in....shoot it is just a great drink!"
484090,32987,2009-07-15,4,"This is the first time I make Rice Pudding.  I used 2% milk, 1/2 cup of milk and 2 teaspoons of vanilla instead.  It turned out to be very very good.  Next time, I might use 3.25% milk to make it even more creamier!"
1118084,47373,2009-02-06,4,"Great concept.  The texture was good.  I found that using milk instead of cream, and adding a little extra at the end to adjust consistancy was key.  1/4-1/8 tsp of dry mustard instead of worcestershire sauce also gave it more bite.  Used double boiler or it burned easily.  Kids loved it over steamed broccoli!"
594620,6584,2007-10-18,5,"Oh my, this was OUT OF THIS WORLD!  This is without a doubt the best Rogan Josh I've ever eaten.  There is nothing negative to say about this one.  Notes on my ""adjustments"":  I left out the yogurt as my newborn has many food allergies and dairy ends up in my milk.  It tasted FABULOUS even without the yogurt.  I just omitted steps 7 and 8 and went on with the recipe.  I used whole coriander and cumin seeds and ground them in my coffee grinder turned spice mill.  :D  I also used 4 tablespoons of a pre-mixed garlic-ginger paste I buy at our local Indian grocery.  FABULOUS!  And, yes, this one smells simply wonderful cooking.  My house has never smelled so great!  :D  Thanks for such a fabulous recipe.    See picture I've submitted.  Mmm..."
37305,33474,2003-08-26,5,"These were awesome over ice cream and very easy to make.  I was a little worried when they were done because the syrup looked thin, but once it cooled all the way it thickened up.  I am storing them in the refrigerator and we have had them twice now...very tasty and sooooo inexpensive compared to the tiny pricey jar in the stores!  Thanks for posting this in response to my request so looong ago...I finally got around to making them!"
54697,96988,2004-10-20,5,Excellent.  I too added some seasoning salt and pepper and tossed an onion into the bottom of the pot.  I made orzo with the juice and it was just great.  
5060,114719,2007-09-17,5,mmm Caroline the sauce on these pork chops is outstanding! DH loved them with mashed potatoes. I used olive oil instead of the butter and 2% milk for the half and half; and a crisp white wine to deglaze the pan; also used fresh parsley from the garden. Served them with baby carrots. A wonderful meal that will be repeated many times.  Thanks for sharing!
649263,253236,2007-12-25,5,"Everyone at church loved it and I'm making it again to take to my mom's today. I didn't do step 3 in a sauce pan, only in a bowl and poured it over the pasta.  I also used regular half-n-half."
310001,174592,2015-01-05,5,"Very simple and delicious, thank you. We did ours with hot sauce and the kids portions with bbq sauce. Both were equally good. Thank you."
1048246,390089,2010-01-04,5,Great salad served up with a nice marinated steak.  I used spinach and romaine lettuce.  We loved it and will be having it again soon!
261344,83524,2009-09-27,5,I make this all the time and have for years.  It is fabulous and even the leftovers (if you have any) are good.  I usually add some hot sauce for an extra kick.
1926986,100055,2011-06-08,4,"Great Recipe, tastes very close to McDonalds sauce! Thanks for sharing."
1058097,436199,2011-01-13,5,"I used a jalapeno instead of the red chili.  This is a really excellent, unusual chicken dish, and extremely easy.  This is just bursting with flavor.  Thanks for posting!"
350372,20050,2007-10-24,5,"I thought this was fabulous. It was my first time using my pressure cooker (or a pressure cooker, for that matter). I'm sure I screwed up the pressure part... but this lamb stew would not be denied. It came out flavorful and tender. Very good stuff!"
476326,268242,2010-09-24,5,"Perfect! I too doubled the recipe with no trouble and they're as good as our IHOP.  For an easy filling, I used a Philadelphia cream cheese mini in strawberry flavor and a drizzle of strawberry syrup.  So freakin' good!"
289709,107235,2006-05-27,4,"I had some bargain pepperoni in the freezer the DH thought he should have, only to discover he didn`t like them.. So, I tried the bake & chip trick. I couldn`t believe the amount of grease that came out of them..I now know why I try never to eat them.. Certainly not a cholestral healthy snack.. However, I do think the chips will get eaten anyway.. Thanks Ms_bold. One more package out of my freezer!!!  "
1352469,638,2009-08-15,0,"This recipe was nearly right on.  Having said that - it is the best I have found so far.  I would say to roast the eggplant just a little longer for that smokey flavor I love. I did 45 minutes and think 50 - 55 minutes may be better (of course it depends on the size of the eggplant).  Also, just a little less lemon juice and tahini.  I used 3 cloves of garlic and it was perfect.  Salt? about 1 tsp. Also, I put the olive oil directly in rather than use it as a topping.  Overall, this recipe is the best I have found."
456858,100235,2013-10-01,3,This was just OK for me.  Probably would not make again.
49632,22169,2002-12-09,5,"This is now a favorite in my family, and even better the next day!!"
150727,221118,2007-11-25,4,"Very good pie.  Got rave reviews from my new son-in-law!!  I did use one of the Pillsbury roll out crusts rather than the homemade, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written.  The apple filling was delicious and this was a very easy pie.

Thanks for the recipe!"
134164,215240,2008-01-02,5,"Very orange-y!  I made these because I had oranges that weren't good for eating, but didn't want them to go to waste.  They were easy to make but required a bit of a time commitment.  Now if I can only think of something to do with them, because they're quite strong for munching on."
542159,416437,2017-04-01,5,Over the moon yummers! The goat cheese added a tasty new dimension and just a little tiny tang. Iâm looking forward to trying you gorgonzola suggestion. This is without a doubt the best cheesy bread Iâve ever had and will remember you and all the truly tasty ideas and suggestion you gave me &lt;3 &lt;3
121690,142448,2006-04-10,5,"This was very, very good with baked fish. I plumped the raisins in warm water a few min before adding. I only used 3 Tbsp oil because I couldn't see where in the recipe the other 2 are used."
54279,31562,2005-05-20,5,Wow! As good as any restaurant. Easy and delicious. Thanks for the recipe!
283390,83524,2006-12-10,5,"This recipe hardly needs another review, but I have to say I was amazed at how delicious this was. I ate both servings myself! Thanks for sharing."
515278,297856,2011-04-17,5,"I don't usually like casseroles, but I had most of the ingredients in the house so decided to try it. It was very, very good. I had some large chunks of good quality frozen broccoli, that I just added to the pasta the last five minutes of cooking, and it turned out perfectly. Used some fajita spiced store-bought chicken, which gave it a little kick."
2001836762,361940,2017-12-03,0,Add a tablespoon of white vinegar before you put it in the pan.. this will ensure a great flavour and tingling taste. And use fine sugar to ensure that it does not have a sandy feel on the tongue...
70662,98421,2009-03-21,5,"this was so delicious and so easy-- I didn't change a thing, and I had a beautiful loaf of bread in just over an hour!  thanks for another great recipe, ridgely!"
1303248,94495,2009-06-29,5,Done it twice.  Very good on a hot day!!!!!!!!
115758,182939,2008-01-11,4,"These were really nice, I enjoyed the addition of the whole wheat flour. We had ours with maple syrup and they were also really nice cold spread with a little butter.
I like the idea of mixing the dry ingredients ahead of time to speed things up in the morning...a great idea when on holidays.
Thanks for sharing."
368277,41705,2008-03-14,5,"We really liked this! I don't know if I didn't put the rice in soon enough at the end, but mine turned out a little soupy. It still was very wonderful with flavor. Amazing there were left overs, but there are only 2 of us eating it. The next night it was the perfect consistency. I just threw the pot back in it tasted perfect. I think the only thing I changed was using chicken broth instead of beef. I too added some smoked turkey sausage and it REALLY made the meal. I didn't even bother cutting up the chicken breasts, they broke up pretty easily themselves, the more they cooked and I stirred. I wonder if you could just add uncooked rice the last hour or so? I'm always up for less dishes."
79036,27208,2003-07-31,5,DH loved this. Will make it again
1672183,23841,2012-01-18,2,These oatmeal cream pies were not that good. There was so much work to make them and not worth the effort. I was disappointed in these. My family didn't like them either and they love Little Debbie brand. will not make these again.
463319,95569,2007-05-03,5,"TOO easy! I put in a bottle of Bullseye (what I had), added a bit of ketchup (like a little sweetness), and used half a vidalia onion. I set it for about 6.5 hours, shredded it at 4 or so, and my brother is currently eating his third sandwich! I put them on toasted buns with a slice of cheese, served with green beans and almonds and some Pirate's Booty! Thanks!"
474645,81856,2008-08-30,5,I have made these several times and always get requests for the recipe.  They taste like a dream bar that they sell at Potbelly's (a sandwich chain in the midwest)  They are WONDERFUL!
185446,63975,2012-01-18,5,"This was a favorite as a kid, and many years later, it still is.  I saute in a little olive oil.  The addition of parmesan cheese is a nice touch.  To me this is the ideal vegetable dish--easy, so attractive and tasty.  I also like other reviewers' helpful suggestions--over pasta or additional sausage sound yummy."
625696,110159,2008-08-13,5,"Great party food!  I didn't make the wasabi-ranch dressing and I didn't deep-fry the chicken, just breaded and sauteed in oil in a skillet.  The ginger-citrus sauce was excellent.  I'm going to try that on regular chicken breasts & fried rice/stir-fry, too.  Everyone loved these and wanted more!"
107864,70646,2007-01-09,5,Cake turned out picture perfect. I took it to work and everybody loved it.  Thank-You!
226867,7829,2017-08-27,5,"In my family this was always referred to as American Potato Salad - who knew it would work for Sweden, too? I'm visualizing the Swedish Chef, ja sure, you betcha! I love the pickles and onions! Oh, I cut it down for 2 of us!! made for CQ4/2017"
29196,184237,2011-01-10,5,"This was sensational thanks Chef floWer. We really, really enjoyed it. I loved the salad-it added something bright and fresh to the whole dish. I think the sauce tasted quite authentically Thai and we both agreed we'd like to eat the whole dish again really soon. I used bream and found it cooked super quick and broke up a little-perhaps more delicate fillets would be better microwaved, steamed or cooked in the oven. Not your fault-just the type of fish I chose to use."
222564,369523,2017-11-25,5,"This is a rustic artisan like savoury cheesecake, which turned out very nice! With polenta crust and roasted garlic and hazelnuts on top, it was different and very pleasing to all senses. Healthy non sweet option for a dessert. I did serve it at room temperature, it was perfect texture and with fig jam on the side, which paired well with the cheese cake."
139004,10179,2004-11-19,5,"These bars are so delicious!  I will also try the recipe with cranberries, a nice holiday touch."
176348,57076,2005-06-10,5,I made these knowing that they were not going to be that sweet.  So I expected it! I am very glad that I made these because I wasn't in the mood for sugary muffins! Great for breakfast!  I loved the coconut top! Yum yum! Thanks!
58892,175643,2006-09-26,4,"I baked it in an 11x14 pan too - and I'm glad I did. I wouldn't have had enough for 2 9x13.  Also I added a little bit more applesauce since the batter was too thick, I thought.   I wouldn't call them brownies though - they're more cake-like than a brownie. But they're easy, healthy and a great way to get the kids (and hubby!) to eat zucchini.  I'll definitely be making these again - great for school snacks.  (I didn't add the nuts because our school is nut-free).   "
1803440520,356953,2014-11-30,1,I don&#039;t know what I did wrong. I followed the directions to a tee. My bread was dry and the cranberries were on the bottom of the loaf.

Thanks for revising the recipe to call for 1&quot; chunks of chicken (my photo shows 2&quot; cubes). My local store did not have fresh tarragon or dill, so I used 1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon, and the dish was delicious. For us, I doubled the amount of broccoli, and the 2 of us devoured the rest of the ingredients with no difficulty, and had dessert.  Made for Please Review My Recipe tag game."

8688,37120,2002-10-08,5,"Theses carrots were absolutely delicious!  So very simple to prepare with great results! I cooked as directed and when adding the lemon, salt & pepper, parsley and butter I added also 1 tsp of sugar. Excellent recipe!  Thanks, Junebug!"

I also didn't have dill weed, so substituted dill seed, ground in the blender. I halved this recipe. Thanks for sharing!"

83093,285547,2008-03-21,3,"This recipe captured my imagination so I took it for a test drive before using it as a formal dessert.  The concept is brilliant however the actuality fell short for me.  I took one out of the freezer and timed it. One hour later, it was thawed enough to pry off the lid. Spooning it out was tough! I finally resorted to a demitasse spoon to get the segments apart. I am still intrigued and plan to tinker with this.  Perhaps if the orange were segmented like a grapefruit *before* freezing, it would be easier to eat.  Thanks for the idea!  It was fun to play with and the few pith-free bites I was able to snag tasted great."
156891,4957,2008-01-15,5,"This was so easy and delicious, even my kids could make it."
773778,400550,2010-04-25,5,"I made this dinner for me and my husband and we both loved it!  I used green pepper instead of red, and left out the ginger.  I also used Pork instead of chicken, which was lovely.  I served it over Basmati rice.  Loved the sauce!  Great recipe!"
230102,258179,2008-07-13,5,"This makes a delicious and not too spicy lasagna.  I was very happy to find a good meatless version; and can see how it would appeal to kids.  I followed instructions exactly, except I used Bootsie's Louisiana seasoning for the ""BAM"" because I didn't want to fool with making a batch of Bam.  I started assembling it into a 2"" deep 9 x 13 pan and had to move it into a 3"" deep pan as it wouldn't fit.  I used all but about 1 1/2 cups of  Emeril's sauce and it set up very nicely.  I had never used no-boil noodles before and was quite pleased with the results.  They do have a slightly different texture than traditional noodles.  It was all very successful and now I have a lot of single servings of Lasagna in my freezer!  Marg, thanks for a excellent recipe!"
332786,46832,2009-07-15,5,I have been looking for a recipe like this for a very long time.  I love this dish and have enjoyed it at my favorite restaurant for years.   After trying several recipes I am thrilled to have found this one.  It is perfect.  The only thing I would do is double liquid and seasonings.  The more broth the better.  Thank you so much for this little gem!
317554,69429,2009-07-15,4,"Very moist and good!  I added a little cayenne to increase the spice, and cooked in cupcake form.  Delicious, and they keep well frozen--good thing since it made a couple of dozen and I'm the only one in the house who likes gingerbread.  Serious self-indulgence! Thanks!"
2001390207,139960,2017-02-13,0,BEWARE!!!!!! These muffins are AMAZING! I entered everything in my WW recipe builder and got 7 points each when you make 18 muffins. I had a friend do the same thing and that's what she got too! I knew they tasted too good to be 2 Points! I also only used 2 TEASPOONS Of baking powder.
500860,186142,2007-09-09,4,"I used a bit more butter and this gave it a nice buttery flavor (I also greased with butter and brushed melted butter on top) Did NOT TAKE 30 MIN to cook this. Took much less. I think I over cooked this. I made it in the oven until it ""set"". Was very good. Would have been good grilled. I wasn't sure it would work or be tasty, but it really was.

I'm not falling over myself with how tasty this was, though. It was above average, but not by much."
594923,292160,2008-12-10,5,"Yummy! I halved the beef, but kept everything else the same and served it up for dinner. I loved the beef and blue cheese combination. Thanks!"
2002209614,350443,2018-07-06,5,This is a great recipe! So easy... i will add some garlic powder next time as someone else suggested... just to add extra flavor but not a necessity. Everyone loved it. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

That is how i make Sausage Biscuits and Gravy"
640657,281006,2009-09-19,5,"What a fabulous twist on chili!  While there are a lot of ingredients, few of them require much chopping or preparation so it came together fairly quickly.  The turkey pieces became so tender in the slow cooker, and I just loved the butternut squash in it.  Can't wait to make this again."
206722,34753,2006-03-29,5,"This was my first sourdough bread, and it came out really great. The instructions were very helpful for a newbie to accomplish a beautiful loaf of bread!  I used my bread machine to mix the dough."
198154,96582,2015-08-06,1,"One bite, couldn&#039;t even swallow it.  I made it with pumpkin spice coffee, and pumpkin puree. I wouldn&#039;t suggest that combination to anyone, they were awful."
474155,15072,2007-05-13,4,"I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup, added walnuts and mixed peanut butter/chocolate chips. These brownies were ok, a mix between fudgy and cakey for me."
884411,8453,2009-12-29,5,"Scrumptious!  I used HQ meat, cut in strips and chunked.  Surprisingly tender!  Looking forward to trying it with some loin.  Hubby was very happy."
4337,7435,2001-03-19,5,I tried Kevin's recipe for the Corned Beef and the recipe on the package of another pre-prepared brisket. The aroma and texture of Kevin's preparation were exciting. A fine blend of liquids and spices.
652321,111868,2008-07-09,3,"This was ok.  I wasn't expecting the sauce to be so sweet.  I think if I make it next time I won't add any sugar.  To my husband and I, the sauce really overpowered the steak."
115506,116769,2012-01-11,5,"It's was the New Year!!!  Panic! I had no idea how to fix black eye peas so that our family would have good luck this year.  I found this recipe; I liked and had most of the ingredients.  My daughter scampered and found a mixture of macaroni, fresh presoaked black eye peas, green chilie instead of green peppers, and lots of diced bacon. I also used Mexican cheese along with the cheddar.  Finally served jalapenos seperately, for those with with different heat tolerances.  My family loved it....even me...I hate black eye peas."

1607893,151107,2011-04-28,5,"Thank you for this recipe.... I was looking for something to do with my chicken breasts for dinner and spotted this just in time.  It was marvellous.  Have to admit that I used a beaten egg to dip them in before the crumb mixture, but otherwise was perfect.  Thank you for what will become a basic quick meal for us from now on."
1215617,20616,2009-03-26,5,"This soda bread is fantastic, and the best recipe I've ever found for this Irish specialty"
67656,134855,2005-10-24,5,Beth - This was just wonderful. I wanted to make just a small amount so I made  a small batch in little individual shells in Pyrex custard cups.  Also used fat-free pudding and low-fat grahams.  Wish I had a little bit of chocolate sauce to drizzle on top as that would have sent this over the edge.  
239210,111798,2005-08-27,0,"I can't wait to try this.  My mom used to make something similar, and now so do I.  Using hamburger patties and marjoram instead of pork and rosemary.  This sounds like a great alternative."
212654,134573,2011-03-28,5,I used this as a springboard to make the coleslaw dressing my mother used to make with Miracle Whip. It really was perfect. I added more vinegar and sugar (to make the slaw sauce) and seven college students really enjoyed it.  It really was perfect! The cooked part added body and flavor.
285039,36386,2007-08-07,5,"I made this for dinner, with some changes.  I used risotto for the rice and tomato sauce instead of Ketchup for the topping.  I did omit the dill, because my neighbor does not care for it.  Overall very Yummy!!!"
1369506,83666,2009-08-30,5,Absolutely love this soup.
868551,77397,2012-04-24,5,great easy recipe...i topped mine with walnuts and pecans and drizzled with confectioners sugar mixed with a little milk and vanilla...freezes very will too...a keeper thanks!
394077,116173,2008-07-26,3,The meat came out tender but the sauce ruined it for me.  The mustard taste was too strong for me.
307214,79431,2013-06-09,5,"August 6, 2012 - Delicious and easy - will make again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Updated:  Made a few times and continues to be a winner.  Even made it without the cheese (was out) and although it tasted different it was still yummy."
10404,16884,2009-04-21,5,"You said I had to try this one and I did.  I needed a few dips for a staff meeting-this was one of them.  RAVE reviews!  I used applewood smoked bacon from a local butcher and extra sharp cheddar.  I loved it, hubby complained that I didnt leave him enough, and everyone ""needed"" the recipe.  Easy to make, outstanding flavor.

Di;-)"
1352433,87225,2009-08-15,5,"These were a scrumptious and easy snack. I loved them! We added a dash of cinnimon and vanilla, but they were also amazing on their own! I will certainly be making these again! YUM!"
46545,73679,2004-04-08,5,"This has such a fantastic blend of flavors... ginger, curry, and onion. The tomato, lemon and cilantro (one of my favs!) topped it off perfectly.  I was thinking I should add garlic or cayenne but it is perfect as is!  That's a rare thing for me to say because I use cayenne like most folks use black pepper.  The only change I made was to omit the chickpeas, but only because I went to the pantry for them and they weren't there!  I will definitley be making this over and over, WITH both beans next time!!!"
47892,143065,2011-10-05,5,Easy! Colorful! Nutritious! We are savoring the last remnants of summer's harvest by<br/>preparing the salad last night for dinner. I used a Charentais cantaloupe and both standard and lemon cucumbers. Most of the veggies were either from our CSA box or the local farmer's market. Served over baby spinach and baby arugula leaves. Simple goodness! My kind of salad recipe that's for sure. Use good quality vinegar because it plays a major role in the recipe. Reviewed for Veg Tag/October. Served alongside Andi's Recipe #333005 and Recipe #93429. Thank you for posting!
444967,314630,2008-11-15,5,This is an excellent recipe.  I put the penne on the plate and the chicken on top.  DH really liked it!  I think I may add some parmesan cheese to the sauce next time.  Loved the kick!
568123,26927,2007-12-06,4,Definitely easy and it turned out perfectly cooked.  I would back off on the salt and maybe use onion powder instead.  It would also be good with some rosemary or thyme rubbed on the outside.  Great recipe and I will do it again!
91867,76930,2004-03-20,4,"My family enjoyed this a lot.  My DD wouldn't eat the noodles - but my DH and I loved them.  I wasn't sure whether to serve the noodles hot or cold, so I split them in half and served half of them hot and the other half cold.  We definitely liked the warm noodles better.  Overall a great recipe and we will be making this again."
869532,305849,2009-07-07,4,I liked making this kind of marinade. I used olive oil. Heating it brings out the flavors. But I wouldn't describe it as 'spicy'. But it still had great flavor. Made for 1-2-3 hits.
161282,358626,2010-07-15,5,"This is one of my all time favorite dips!!! So delicious and so simple! Discovered it years ago at a party & begged for months for my friend to get the recipe. Come to find out it only consisted of Knorr Vegetable Soup Mix & sour cream. I figured she had to be wrong & immediately made it to see for myself. Been making it ever since! Throw this together for a party with some fresh veggies and crackers or chips & I guarantee you'll not only please your old friends, but probably make some new ones!"
866963,296523,2010-05-03,5,Now I know what to do with the leftover wrappers! These were a nice treat.
28514,46464,2010-02-16,5,Just excellent couldn't be easier.
33443,26431,2002-11-29,5,"My above rating should of definetly been a five star (forgot to put star rating). I make this all the time, it's the best!I never add the 2 tbsp of water, as I like it extra thick."
49773,51143,2004-12-08,5,"This is an awsome dish,very easy and I always have these ingredients on hand. Thank You for posting."
125388,151860,2010-06-06,5,"This is a great marinade that really makes for a tender tri-tip.  I used the full amount of beer, but half the soy sauce and the lesser amount of the garlic, because I also wanted to use a dry rub from Santa Maria (central coast) that contained salt and garlic.  The result was delicious."
377070,183946,2007-06-13,5,Beautifully easy - great appearance (doesn't separate) and best of all - fabulous flavour!  One note - don't use on a greens mixture that has dill in it.  Dill and this dressing do NOT get along.  Dill bad - dressing good. (photo to come later)
1800287784,445873,2013-11-21,4,"Really liked this recipe. The scallops were just right, nice and tender without being overdone. The only modification that I made was the addition of 1 tsp of minced shallots and 1 tsp of minced fresh garlic to the butter/wine mixture, which I saut&eacute;ed until tender before adding the paprika, lemon and season salt."
57853,14243,2002-12-09,5,Today is my birthday and I had my wife cook this cake.  It is very good.  I like anything with orange in it. Thanks for such an easy recipe. For sure 5 stars. 
802679,51997,2008-07-19,5,"The name doesn't lie - these are AWESOME! The only thing I did was add a bit of grated lemon rind to the batter for a bit of added flavour, other than that I made them just as directed and they turned out AWESOME!  My husband and I polished off 16 in 4 days :x"
1925885,190039,2012-09-20,5,"UPDATE:  Tried these again making adjustments as suggested by local expats:  I used 50/50 margarine and butter, added extra flour due to the water content of CR's butter and moved my oven rack up a level.  THAT'S THE TICKET!!!  These cookies are AMAZING!!!   Original Review: These cookies have an amazing flavor!  I'd like to give them five stars, except mine spread way too thin and I ended up with one great big cookie-sheet sized cookie!  However, this may not be the fault of the recipe, since the same thing happened yesterday with another cookie.  My bad oven, or maybe its the Costa Rican butter; sigh...  I love the combination of the lime with the cinnamon and nutmeg - even though we ended up with a not-very-pretty cookie, they disappeared pretty quickly!  Yum!  Thanks for posting!"
632249,60235,2009-10-01,5,"Update: I now make these granola bars on a weekly basis to pack in lunch boxes. I love that you can change up the nuts/dried fruits and add spices. I have posted some photos to show others how I prepare and wrap these, so I hope someone finds it helpful. I prepare the recipe and press it into a cookie sheet. Cool and cut into approx. 18 bars. For the kids, I wrap one bar individually in waxed paper, but for my husband I wrap 2 per pkg.  Each bar is roughly the size of a commercially packaged granola bar. This recipe is so economical, it is unbelievable how much money I save. So thanks so much Spatchcock, this is one of my top Zaar recipe picks. Original review June 15/09: Delicious and budget friendly. I hate to pay $3.49 for 6 little granola bars! This is very budget friendly and I know exactly what is in them. I added coconut and almonds and increased the corn syrup just a bit to make up for these additions. They were great! Thx so much spatchcock!"
1473915,121202,2010-12-08,0,"Good suggestions.  I always add fresh lemon juice at the end, and sometimes gated parm.  We have this very often when the zuccs come on.  Luckily, my husband never tires of it."
392230,216575,2007-06-12,5,"Awesome rice! DH absolutely raved! And, DD who does not care much for ""plain"" rice, even said, and I quote, ""This rice is the bomb, Mom!"" So, there you have it! That earns this recipe a 5 star rating from me! Made for Zaar World Tour."
73836,95409,2004-08-22,5,"Found this recipe yesterday and made it for supper last night with great results!  I used a couple of chicken carcasses that I had frozen and made homemade stock and also had some frozen meat to use.  I didn't have any barley, so I used brown rice instead, with excellent results.  Also, I halved the recipe since there are only two of us.  We loved it!  This is a very delicious soup, thanks so much for posting the recipe!"
2693104,397804,2013-02-14,0,"Just made this, soo yum. My kids love it. Perfect for my kids lunchbox.."
1462970,66986,2014-01-16,5,"These were delicious!  Though I made a few major modifications - 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup coconut oil, cut sugar to 1/2 cup (we don&#039;t like super sweet), and added about 3/4 cup walnuts and 3/4 cup chopped fudge with macadamia nuts (leftover from a Christmas gift).  Yum yum!!"
92006,505377,2017-11-22,5,"I made these as directed, except, I added 1/2 cup of beef broth I'm glad I did, because I used the resulting broth to spoon over the meat. It was great with flour tortillas and salsa. One of my kids are it with BBQ sauce and he thought it was good that way too. Made with love for Susie's cook-a-thon."
85018,359948,2011-06-09,5,"Never had Publix chicken salad but I think I've tried at least 60% of all the chicken salad recipes in the USA.  I adore chicken salad.  If it's on a menu somewhere, I'm gonna have to try it.  And I make some type of chicken salad several times a month here at home.  So, believe me when I say this is a really GOOD one! I did do as another reviewer mentioned and steamed the carrots briefly, otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter!  This is going in my Special Recipe File and we'll have it often.  Thanks for posting it!"
882197,127110,2018-09-27,3,"Being from southern IL we wouldn't call this bbq, but different areas of the country have their own tastes and flavors so I won't knock it other than to say it was ok."
140132,32503,2011-01-05,5,We loved these kabobs.  The marinade reminded me of a teriyaki sauce and we really like that.  I omitted the cherry tomatoes (personal preference) but added some onions.  I let the chicken marinate for about 2 1/2 hours before skewering and then brushed it on while grilling.  I also saved some to serve on the table.  We served this with some rice pilaf and dinner rolls.  Thank you so much for sharing this yummy meal with us.
937121,299832,2008-09-11,5,"I tried this recipe and it was really good and very quick. Thanks for the fast, pretty and tasty recipe! I will be making these again and again."
235355,30745,2007-03-12,3,Made this twice - just to give it a 2nd chance since it had gotten so many great reviews...  First time tried it as written - way too sweet for my DH and I.  Second time tried using tomatoe sauce (8oz) instead of Ketchup and added about 1/4 cup soy sauce.  These changes helped a lot but we still didn't love it.  Thanks for submitting the recipe - obviously a lot of other people loved it... It just wasn't something we'd try again.
44383,32548,2003-01-20,5,Made this tonight for dinner and got rave reviews all around.  We're not usually fussy about lasagna but everyone agreed that this was the best lasagna any of us had tasted in a long time.  Followed the directions exactly.  Great recipe. Thanks!
950577,107570,2009-10-22,5,"This is a wonderful recipe.It sounds like a odd combination of ingredients but it turns out awesome,even my picky eater loved it.We did use a peach jam instead of apricot,but still has a great taste"
74515,10508,2004-09-21,3,"My kids liked these a lot, but I wasn't crazy about them."
91392,29538,2006-08-20,4,"Very easy and good on ribs.  A little heavy on the hoisin, that was the taste that stood out, but still very good and I was happy to have Asian style ribs after years without them.  Tahnks for a super easy recipe where I had everything I needed in the kitchen to make the sauce."
92641,106875,2005-02-19,5,"I have never made or eaten a latke before and these were delicious. I love the little patties with or without the sauce. I did omit the gingerroot for personal tastes, but thought the recipe still worked beautifully.  I look forward to making these again, thank you for sharing Chia!"
28636,358066,2009-05-22,5,"Intensely chocolate!!  As other reviewers have stated, this was like drinking a candy bar!  Demi-tasse cups would be best for this decadent treat.  The children found it too strong but the adults loved it.  Thanks Julie B's Hive for an almost sinful beverage.  Made for Ali Baba's Babes for ZWT5"
1179225,332274,2013-06-07,5,"What a delicious simple cake. It rose beautifully. I was nervous it might stick to the pan, but it came right out. Served with vanilla ice cream for a real treat. Thanks for posting the recipe!"
2078364,459167,2011-11-22,5,I absolutely love them!!! I like to put them on my smoker for 2 hours though for an awesome snack!!!!
129177,18732,2009-12-13,5,YUM!!  I added chopped carrots. Great soup!
204024,280905,2010-02-06,5,"This is a great, easy meal that everyone with a family to feed needs to have in the mix.  I do suggest a real oven-baked potato for quality, but ours was cooked in a crock pot and they can also be nuked for convenience.  Taco stuffing in a potato is a pleasant surprise to those who haven't tried it and comfort food for those familiar with it. We have been doing something similar for years, calling it ""Irish tacos.""  Kids love them, and they can be done salad-bar style with varied toppings so picky eaters can build their own.  Made for Top Favorites of 2009."
135470,217132,2010-07-02,3,"For us these were just ok. I had some lovely smoked salmon from Portlock Salmon here in Seattle, and I felt it totally got lost in the potato. Overall I thought it need more seasoning, I added pepper but waited to add salt until I cooked them not knowing how salty the salmon would be; we did end up adding a little but maybe some dill or old bay would be good too. The garlic cream was a bit heavy for me, I also thought it needed a little pizzaz so I added extra lemon and a fresh garlic clove. Made for ZWT 6 ZINGO by one of the Unrulies Under the Influence."
1117788,85199,2010-06-17,0,"To Chef #1409787, REAL Texas chili DOES NOT contain beans.. I've lived in Texas since I was born and know that for a fact. You can look it up on the Internet too. Btw, this recipe sounds great! Gotta try it :) Thnx Just Cher"
187373,34166,2011-12-12,4,"This recipe is just okay.  I made it using regular potato that I shredded (and used twice what was called for), but the potato just got lost.  Next time, I would cube.  My husband wouldn't eat any of it (said ""yup, tastes like corn"") so we threw his out.  I did have boneless skinless chicken thigh in place of the ham, but don't think that would've made that much of a difference."
691546,128546,2007-12-17,5,"I have made this a few times and it is always a HUGE crowd pleaser. it's very simple to make and delicious. i add 1/4 cup celery for a lil crunch and white onions and i add an extra tablespoon of butter. 

I give the recipe to my single friends and i call it ""catch a man chowder""!"
67656,123706,2007-04-10,3,"I really like the combination of winter squash and potatoes and this recipe uses both well.  Simple to pull together, this was a solid side that we enjoyed.  Since sodium is a consideration here, I used a mix of garlic salt and garlic powder.  Next time I would consider adding simple herbs perhaps thyme or basil (but not both).  My biggest challenge with this dish was the cooking temperature.  My casserole was prepared at 355 degrees (the equivalent of 180c) and at 45 minutes my 1 inch cubes were still quite hard. At 55 minutes the squash was cooked and golden but the potatoes were just barely firm and without color. After an hour, I served the casserole but the state of the potatoes certainly diminished our enjoyment of the dish. I think a higher temperature would have worked better.  Noticed (after the fact) the previous reviewer cooked at 450 which my guess would do well. Thanks."
748565,62311,2010-02-22,4,"wow, were these good & sweet. A very different take on brownies, didn't think you could make brownies without unsweetened cocoa powder!"
388905,197565,2007-01-14,5,This is very good and very rich.  I keep them in the refrigerator after I make them.  I think they taste better that way.  Thanks for the recipe Emily...
428885,255839,2008-06-17,5,"Fantabulous! This is a refreshing, wonderful drink that made a hard day on the farm great to come home to. Easy to put together and the taste outstanding. The sugar cube was such a nice touch. I am always trying to find little treats to sneak in a sugar cube and this was it! Thank you so much Engrossed! Made for *ZWT4* June 2008."
400991,35292,2007-03-14,5,"I loved this.  I'm staying away from carbs so I left out the rice.
I used fresh spinach and canned artichoke hearts instead of eggplant, and used low fat mozzerella. I kept everything else the same.  It was wonderful.  My whole family loved it. This is a keeper!"
500790,77430,2010-02-07,5,Great recipe! Thanks for posting!!
325816,63028,2007-11-14,3,This tasted very good but made very little (I did not have enough to frost a birthday cake that I had made). Also since this is supposed to be a chocolate frosting I guess I expected a real chocolate brown but this is a very light colored pale brown. Otherwise this was easy to make and the kids enjoyed licking the beaters clean.
316121,8903,2007-01-25,4,"very simple and tasy - i grilled some of the cheese and added it on top of the lentils and pasta layered on fresh vine tomatoes with salad leaves. 

Very nice"
689367,111169,2012-07-17,5,This would be good with gorgonzola too!
588863,172448,2012-11-04,5,We serve this each year at our Christmas Party.  Everyone seems to love it. We order the Jalapeno Jam or Pepper Jam from Kitchen Kettle in PA.
792255,225291,2009-03-29,5,Best cake ever!!!
2880796,213528,2013-06-28,0,"We added a big dollop of nutella, a banana, a gloop of  honey, and topped the whipped cream with the irish cream coffee powder. decadent! We are going to try to make them turtle style next, can&#039;t wait!"
621325,110743,2009-11-02,0,"We didn't care  for this. I'm not going to rate it w/stars b/c really it just wasn't what I thought it would be, I guess w/""Thai"" food I was expecting different...I was expectng more of a spicy and robust flavor.  That is probably more my fault than anything lacking in the recipe.  We felt it was really bland. 

 I do use ""natural"" peanut butter so maybe the seasonings in JIF or Skippy were missing.  I had to add corn starch to thicken the sauce to get the texture which we are used to w/Thai food. We added some crushed red pepper and some salt as we were eating the meal. 

I'm not making this again BUT those who are just getting used to Thai seasonings might like this."
215898,321959,2012-12-31,5,"The whole family loved this!  We've tried many mac & cheese recipes, but this is definitely the best we've had so far."
170110,106200,2004-12-18,4,"Hi there Hadice,

Thanks for your help with this recipe - the kids at my sons school really enjoyed these.  They were something different and the candy canes added a unique taste. My husband was just upset more were not left home.  Merry Christmas"
210010,37638,2006-12-30,4,This was really good! My husband liked it too. I used diced tomatoes in with the juice so I cut back on the water to 2 cups. I also used minute rice so I followed the water/rice ratio on the rice box. Very good and easy recipe!
683464,14911,2013-07-03,5,"This is a great recipe with simple ingredients and it&#039;s so easy to make.  Why would anyone ever use a mix?  I like that you can adjust the amount of pepper, something that you can&#039;t do with a mix.  This recipe is a winner."
1812310,121202,2013-09-03,5,I served this for a side dish and everyone loved it....took the advice of others and put a dash of red pepper flakes.  Will make this again real soon.
911978,196233,2011-01-24,5,"""It tastes like in Mexico!"" my kids said. JalapeÃ±os alone gave enough heat for our taste. I recommend using lime, not lemon, if you can. Freshly squeezed lime juice makes a difference. In Mexico it was always served with lime. We used napa cabbage for garnishing. Definitely a keeper. It's exactly what we've been looking for. Delicioso.Thanks for sharing!"
68960,32677,2004-02-08,5,"This is a great salad dressing.  I made a salad, laid it out on a serving platter then shreaded a BBQ chicken on top and topped with this dressing.  Looked and tasted fantastic.  Another quick easy summertime meal that I will make often.  Thanks Bergy."
1061114,21886,2009-12-30,5,"I modified this recipe but it was a great base to adjust according to what I had in the house.  I used 1/2 the amount of beef and garlic salt &, doubled the onion, and added cooked rice at the end.  It was a delicious soup & I will definitely cook it again!"
118268,74438,2009-02-11,5,"This was a delicious, quick salmon recipe for me on chicken night.  (I hate chicken)  I have made it twice now and now look forward to chicken night.  Thanks for sharing!"
2001848013,104438,2018-11-26,5,My Mom made this exact same recipe &amp; I loved them. She passed away &amp; I made these today. I had it in my cookbook but the only difference was 1/3 Cup Milk instead of 1/2 Cup ...I may have made a mistake when I copied the recipe so I used 1/2 Cup...I am from NS as well
192264,201986,2009-10-04,0,Wonderful! Thanks!
35635,28662,2003-04-24,5,"I made the whole recipe the night before and refrigerated it to take to work as lunch. I nibbled on some of it at break and the rest at lunch. Excellent and I didn't have to feel guilty. Thanks, Kari!"
148319,42311,2005-12-20,5,"Excellent recipe. Tried it for a german themed dinner party and now I'm asked for them all the time! Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
2002267555,2886,2018-09-06,5,This recipe is super easy to make and absolutely DELISH!!! ????????
132383,26420,2005-06-06,5,This was so easy and simple.  Thank you so much.
143001,61897,2004-12-31,5,"A delicious salad, and a very clever recipe idea.  I made it vegetarian style... just left off the meat and added some corn, freshly cut off the cobb so that the kernals were still stuck together in little rows.  Baby corn would also be nice for a vegetarian version. I'll definately make this again."
114522,149363,2008-10-08,5,"My husband loved it, he was happy that I found a recipe that is perfect for diabetics so that he can now eat a desert that he loves. The second pie I cooked, I made one change, instead of the cornstarch I used half a cup of Bisquick so that the pie holds more together. 
Thank you for that wonderful recipe. I am going to do it a lot more time."
993273,272270,2009-03-31,5,Made this as a suprise for my hubby on Saturday and he loved it!  Super moist and oh so yummy!
482376,506141,2014-04-10,5,"Easy and excellent salad! I loved the flavor of the lemon juice, balsamic and olive oil combination (although, I had to pour some out of the finished product becasue I had too much). The salad ingredients are perfect together, too. I used red onion, but kept all the other ingredients as listed. I&#039;m putting this recipe into my best-of-the-best file! I used this as a dinner side, but would also love it as a lunch. Yum! Made for the Spring Pick-A-Chef event in the Contest and Events forum."
1800272884,197391,2013-11-29,5,"This is the first time making craberry sauce, and I have to tell you that I will NEVER buy whole berry sauce again. My family raved about it. My husband, who does not like whole berry sauce, has told me that I can make this anytime. Wonderful recipe and so easy to make."
171084,95996,2006-04-27,5,"This was soooo good!  I added 3 TBS sour cream to the gravy and my oh my!!  DH could not stop eating and then took a big leftover dish to work same night to share with his crew.  We will make this again!
Thanks so much!!"
246413,61040,2005-10-11,5,"My family loved it!  It was easy to make, took a bit longer because it was my first time, but it went very well.  I used roasted garlic spagetti sauce to give it more flavor."
789516,9467,2011-08-28,5,"This is so yummy and easy!  loved the smell of the house while it simmered.  Next time I'll throw 2 more jalapeno in because I didn't find this spicy at all, and I'll leave out the allspice and cloves as it reminded me too much of my families recipe for chili sauce with these two ingredients in it.  Still very very good, and I'll be making it again next year!"
38418,26257,2009-09-25,4,Really good.  The spice was a bit too  much for me and the kids.  I will decrease the pepper next time.
2000744157,262808,2015-12-24,5,"this recipe is one that I have used for many years and is always well received. I have found that it helps to make it in a foil lined pan that you then pull the whole thing out of the pan when cooled, remove the foil and then cut the bars on a cutting board. Also note that caramels don&#039;t come in 14 oz. bags anymore, usually 11 or 12 oz. bags."
237123,74629,2006-01-31,5,"This is just great.  It is tasty and super easy- just can't get better than that.  Made this last night so that we'd have some healthy food for lunches this week.  I divided it up into six serving sized containers, topped with steamed spinach and baked tofu and tada- pre-made lunches.  I'm so happy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  We'll be enjoying it all week!"
175124,28734,2007-02-23,4,"This was good but I had to ""doctor it up"" a bit. When I first tasted it, it  was pretty bland. But I added a couple extra Tbsps of sweet chilli, some fish sauce, and some lime zest and juice (I didn't have lime leaves). I also added quite a bit of a Thai pepper-lime seasoning mix that I happened to have. I also added some broccoli, but it could've also done with some red capsicum strips. It was VERY rich! Nice and easy."
41292,42343,2003-10-03,5,Would definately make this again.  Cooked it on the stovetop only because I forgot to throw it into the crockpot before going to work.  Would be an easy thing to bring to a potluck.
129372,90502,2010-08-08,4,"Excellent! Great most bread. I went with the 2 tsp of cinnamon suggested by others, but still could handle a little more but we love cinnamon!"
860079,322769,2009-04-16,5,"Well I selected this recipe for DH, and he LOVED it. He could be a vegetarian if he wanted, and this sandwich made him very happy. I used alfalfa sprouts too! A keeper for those hot summer night light dinners! Thanks NorthwestGal! Made for PRMR April 2009!"
131126,289337,2008-09-17,5,"This easy recipe was a nice find for PAC-Fall '08.   Because of the small number dining I reduced the recipe. I also elected to replace the tomato with a red bell pepper since I would have leftovers and used black olives.  Next time I might add a few more veggies for additional color, but they aren't needed.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!"
45849757,330880,2015-04-12,5,"Second time I&#039;ve made this and I absolutely love it! Too much sauce for the chops though. But I&#039;m working on a way to use the leftover sauce with something else. Both times I&#039;ve used Guinness Draught for the dark beer. Very complex flavors but very easy recipe. This time I forgot to make in advance, so I cooked on High in crockpot for 4 hours. Next time I might try cooking in a very large skillet for a quicker dinner"
799115,281876,2012-06-18,0,"I made this as a salsa for a get-together.  I changed the following: Two handfuls of cilantro, 1 and a half jalapenos, 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead of 1/4.  I also added half a large tomato since I had it hanging around from breakfast.  Although I have now made this a spicy cucumber salad, it is still one of the best (and easiest) things I have made in a long time.  Never would have thought black beans/cucumber/corn would go so well together.  Love it!"
1800379714,42768,2013-12-03,1,Wayy too much butter! I had to spoon out the extra and the crust tasted very heavy and buttery.
126104,64300,2009-08-02,3,"I followed this precisely, except I didn't use as much flour as recommended.  About 1/4 c. nicely lightly dusted the shrimp.  There was tons of extra sauce, so I'll save that for later, and probably add another 2-3 cloves of garlic, or maybe some cayenne.  The dish was rather bland to my tastes and slightly disappointing.  I'm going to try it again, because of the ratings, and just see if it was an off night for me.  I hope so...."
168509,80075,2005-09-14,5,"This is delicious! We like it especially with cream and ice or in hot chocolate, yum!"
449702,8488,2007-04-01,5,I made these for company and everyone inhaled them. Soooo good. Thanks so much for posting. I am not sure what absolute has issues with but these are 5 star all the way!
76535,321814,2008-08-29,5,"I got this recipe out of Gourmet  years ago. A little more work than other fried chicken recipes, but worth the effort."
762440,69407,2009-01-29,4,"I halved the recipe as well to make a large loaf.  It was good, but it didn't have as much banana flavor as I had hoped.  I'll definitely make it again and try it with 3-4 bananas instead of 2."
32772,107076,2015-04-06,5,"I love making cake rolls and this recipe was easy to follow. Next time, I will double the filling. Also, I smashed  2 cups up raspberries mixed with sugar and placed this on top of the lemon filling.  I also made a raspberry sauce to go over the cake and ice cream topped with Ready Whip."
57256,53685,2003-02-15,5,"Great Soup!!!! I made this on the stove top and it was really tasty!!I did have to add a little more water to the soup as it simmered,and I also added a few splashes of tamari for a little depth of flavor.This will be made often at my house!!Thank You Sharon123!"
197023,309199,2008-11-14,5,"SO delicious: made exactly to the recipe - which I doubled for two of us - and immensely enjoyed with Noo's Recipe#309195 and a shandy - 1/2 lemonade and 1/2 beer. What else do non-beer-drinkers do with the leftover beer! Yay! :)Beer is a great ingredient! I'll definitely be making these two recipes again! These onions would also be a great accompaniment to meatloaf. Thanks for sharing these two super recipes, Noo! Made for PRMR."
707337,40497,2012-01-15,5,"Works perfectly! I love when healthIer recipes taste good too! This recipe will replace our normal fried chicken. Only change I made was to omit the butter and just spray the chicken and pan with nonstick canola cooking spray. I'm confident this technique would work on bigger pieces of chicken too.  Thank you for a healthier WINNING recipe, Marie!"
2000955619,385948,2016-04-03,5,I can hardly wait for asparagus season so I can try it!  It is going to be amazing!
1170714,119732,2011-01-27,5,"My husband (who is a hard-core Atkins dieter) and I really loved this!  I used more cream cheese than called for because i was afraid of an egg-y flavor, and we loved it!  I also used more cheese than called for because I can't read a recipe!!!  :)  Great for a change of pace in a low carb diet."
1126841,260252,2009-07-24,5,I made this for my sister when she had her baby.  We froze it and she made it according to the directions and it came out great.  They really enjoyed it!
287850,108735,2006-09-16,5,This is exactly the way my mother taught me to make the pies and they are perfect. As a child I can remember her putting the dried apples in a pillow case and hanging them from the rafters upstairs.  
1680722,139167,2010-11-01,5,I was looking for something that I would prepare on the fire... this was wanderful.<br/>I doubled the quantities of carrots and I renounced to the canola oil because I didn't have.<br/>After 3 hours cooking (coverd) we had the plasure to try it. Fantastic in the taste and for this autumn days.<br/>Thanks
138861,116349,2005-10-28,4,"These were tasty and full of flavour. I made the whole recipe to serve to company and as much as people commented on them being yummy, there was alot left over, because as one of my guests said, ""a little goes a long way because they are so rich'. Thank-you for an interesting and tasty treat."
26741,15416,2007-12-30,5,Made one batch for Christmas and guess what?  They went so fast that I made another batch!!  Great orange flavor.  This is going to stay on my holiday cookie list for sure!
1155533,298576,2009-02-02,0,This is soooo good and soooo easy.  I used pepper jack cheese instead of monterey jack and it gave it a nice zing!  Great meal!
341344,55710,2012-12-17,5,Simply fabulous.
382071,65285,2007-05-17,5,This is EASY AND EXCELLENT! They have a WONDERFUL SWEET FLAVOR. I used a red bell pepper and a white onion. I used this recipe for recipe#210671 and it was perfect! Made for 1-2-3 hit wonders.
42651,89863,2004-10-10,5,"We love the taste of lamb, and this lamb-cutlet recipe is a winner. Halved the number of cutlets, but kept everything else the same - garlic, good mustard and rosemary are ALSO great friends of ours.  Thank you."
189979,184866,2007-06-07,5,"This was so easy, fast, and sooo good. I followed the recipe exactly & wouldn't change a thing. The portion size was perfect for my husband and I as most recipes make too much for the two of us."
1745502,522941,2015-07-31,5,"Refreshing! I used fresh cherries, since that&#039;s what I had on hand. It looks very pretty and doesn&#039;t taste too sweet."
43083,115341,2005-11-25,4,"Yummy! These were soooo soft and good. Had today off so decided to do some baking. Next time I would definitely use the whole bag of toffee chips instead of 1 cup. Other than that, perfect! "
1809065,89204,2011-02-08,5,Forget 5 stars I give it 10!!  Not only is it soooo yummy its soooo easy! I didn't have much time so I pressure cooked the chicken and then threw it all into the crock pot to heat up and served with rice and sauted bell peppers and onions. My husband and I have a wonderful local mexican restraunt that serves a polo con creama dish that I have looked EVERYWHERE for the recipie and this dish tastes exactly like it!!! I'm so excited to have it and have already shared it with others!!
803511,180496,2009-05-19,5,This was great.  I made half with flour tortillas and the other half with corn tortillas.  It tasted great both ways.  Ate the leftovers the next day and it was even better.  Thanks!  Made for the Saucy Senoritas ZWT 5.
11297,275504,2008-01-04,5,I am giving this 5*'s as it was what I needed to kickstart my new Year healthy eating after all the 'goodies' consumed over the holidays :) Very filling and healthy at the same time. I used some thinly sliced ham cut from our ham on the the bone which was left over from New Year.  A keeper in my book :)
1688426,78237,2010-09-20,5,"yum I've made it twice now and have changed added ingredients, dried cherries, cranberries, lemon rind, coconut... whatever I have on hand."
234244,202443,2009-01-11,4,"Great little recipe, even my father who normally will only eat a traditional refried bean dip seemed impressed.  A couple changes though...I only used half the amount of butter which seemed to be more than enough, and I sauteed the onions and garlic for a bit before adding the cheese to melt.  I also added some chunky salsa at the end because it tasted like it needed some extra acidity to go with salty tortilla chips."
139977,69192,2004-05-25,5,"This is the kind of recipe that you can play around with to get the taste to your liking. The recipe says to simmer mung beans for a total of 30 mins. I found that I had to boil them at a higher temperature much longer to get them soft. Also, I used vanilla instead of pandan leaves. I boiled the beans together with the sugar and vanilla. When serving I put a small portion of beans in a bowl, barely coating them with water and added about a tablespoon of the coconut milk. Then I added a little more sugar, tasting as I went along to get the sweetness right. With a little tweaking this recipe came out great. Next time I will try the pandan leaves or tamarind paste to get a more exotic flavor. The recipe says to serve the soup hot, but I\'ve tried it both ways and I prefer it cold. If you prefer oriental-style desserts, which are less sweet with more subtle flavor, then you will love this recipe."
54953,73469,2009-11-17,5,Fabulous!  Not too strong pumpkin flavor and the apples were delish!  Even the people who dislike pumpkin loved this.  A keeper for sure!
634627,98568,2010-07-04,5,"The temperature has been over 30ÃÂ°C for nearly a week here in Germany. This was a delicious, light meal on a day that was so hot, we really didn't feel like eating. I used chick broth powder and the soup was still great. I also stirred in a little sour cream after I had pureed the soup and it had cooled a bit. The next day we had the soup again for lunch and squeezed a little lemon juice into it. Very refreshing! Thanks for sharing!"
346619,138015,2007-10-23,5,"every friday night is pizza & movie night for our family.
I made this crust and my family just loves it.
Thanks for another great one."
197023,334172,2009-01-14,5,What a yummy soup!  Just loved the blend of flavours. I used 2 cups of apple juice rather than apple juice concentrate (which I never buy) and water and two Granny Smith apples and slightly more than the specified amount of sweet potatoes and I blended the soup with a stick blender: so much easier. I served this with a generous dollop of my favourite creamy Greek yoghurt.  Thank you so much for posting this wonderful recipe.  Made for Newest Zaar Tag.
152585,208583,2007-09-22,5,This are the best hamburgers I have ever ate.  Just like everyone else has said very moist.  My mom told me that I was going to make these the other night for dinner and I was like ummmmm I dont know about that.  After I mixed it all together I put a chunk of chesse in the middle and placed one of the other patties on top. It made 6 patties but putting them on top of each other like that made 3.  After mom grilling them for me.  We seen how big they was and made them with peppered gravy on top and omg they was sooooo great.  I dont think there was even a spot left on anyones plate after they was done eatting.  Thanks for the great recipe.
28455,20610,2003-01-15,5,"Made these for New Years day, very good, I could eat them all myself, thats not a good thing!!
but the recipe sure is..... followed exactly, we used habanero Tobasco mmmmm.
Thanks"
2876379,365672,2013-06-24,5,This rocked.....all my family devoured the salad this evening....Matched it with copycat Red Lobster biscuits....light dinner perfectly orchestrated......Bon Appetite....
85309,229001,2008-11-16,4,"Used 2 teaspoons of sugar and the results were suprisingly good. Will certainly do again for a quick, warm breakfast on a cold winter morning. Thanks APC."
128473,213058,2008-05-12,5,"Another winner Anna. I enjoyed this adult cocoa so much. I didn't have any creme de menthe left, so I used 2 oz of Bailey's Irish  Mint Cream, it worked beautifully.  Creating a rich, thick, delicious cocoa. The chocolate mint shavings,  marashino cherries and whipped cream were just icing on the cake...Thanks so much for sharing...I will be making this often."
169430,277001,2011-03-20,5,"Scrumptious. I used veggie crumbles for the beef and just followed the recipe for a very tasty meal. Easier than pie too! :D. Made for PAC, spring 2011."
2375420,75389,2012-08-30,0,I'm going to try this recipe this weekend.  Will let you know how it turns out.  Thanks
2001308022,504628,2016-12-20,5,"Yummy! I substituted for the 2/3 cup honey, 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup maple syrup. You do not need to peel the apples. Added 1tsp vanilla to wet ingredients. My spice mix was 1 tsp cinnamon and pinch each of ground cloves, allspice and nutmeg. Did not put nuts in topping, and still delicious!"
345234,215934,2007-07-21,5,Hmmm this was soo good!  Great and impressive at the summer bbq's!  Thanks!
934824,412128,2010-12-19,5,Very good sandwich!
303700,276698,2008-10-15,5,"Made for Photo Tag. *happy sigh* We love this dish! Its flavourful and simple to make and comfort food at the same time. As you will notice we added mushrooms...we kinda like em...LOL
YUMMMMmmmm"
1636470,116236,2013-04-09,5,"Everyone loved this, my 4 year old even asked for more. I will be making this again, thanks!!"
165217,105077,2011-03-21,0,"This recipe was created by Todd Wilbur for his book ""The Best of Top Secret Recipes"" (Penguin/Putnam 2002)"
1609319,749,2012-08-16,5,"We have made this meal sooo many times and it is fabulous. We personally like it best when the zucchini is shredded in the food processor, then has as much water as possible squeezed out of it ( by squeezing handfuls or wrapping in a tea towel and pressing the heck out of it) then cooked in the microwave for 4 mins. We used the low fat ricotta, and used some Ragu instead of all the separate ingredients for the sauce. We do add all the herbs though because we like it to have a stronger taste. Sometimes we add some chilli powder which kicks it up a notch. We also add some mexican cheese, along with the mozarella, to the top which gives it a yummy crust. Fabulous recipe...thanks so much for posting"
628076,20570,2012-11-04,4,"The adults liked this but for some weird reason the kids didn't. I added more broccoli, subbed mayo for miracle whip, and added ricotta and bread crumbs. Next time I will omit the milk or maybe half it. I will also cook up some onions with the ham and a garlic, possibly seasoning salt."
689901,131018,2007-12-16,5,This is the best pulled pork ever!  Fabulous even before adding the sauce if you like your meat dry.  I used Pork Loin as a lower fat version and the meat just fell apart it was so tender.  I also used onion soup mix for flavor vs onions.  Added 1 T lemon juice and 1 T of brown sugar.  My husband said this was the best meat he had ever tasted!!
212609,336604,2009-02-16,4,"A very simple recipe,but like Diner,I felt that it needed a little something else just to lift it up a bit.Some garlic and a little herb would probably do the trick.
Thanks Gayla.Made for PRMR."
516382,20184,2008-02-05,5,"Very good, my kids love them.  I think I'll cut back on the sugar next time though.  I didn't have raisins so used dried cranberries; I like the way they go with the chocolate chips."
597204,89207,2010-05-16,5,Fantastic!  Easy to make and wonderful flavor.
625696,346364,2009-08-30,3,This was just ok for us.  I used dill instead of oregano because its what I had.  Didn't get a whole lot of lemon flavor out of it though.
2000083925,324802,2017-11-10,1,This was the worst excuse for split pea soup I have ever tasted. Amy makes vegetarian split pea soup that is pretty darn good. It's a lot easier to open a can than make this mess.
227652,62130,2005-07-09,4,I really liked this recipe & it freezes very well. Goes great with hot chocolate. I especially liked the taste of almond extract. 
259150,57153,2006-09-24,5,"Ellie!!!!!  These were DELICIOUS!!!Did you hear me?!?!?!?! SOOO Good!  Loved them.  Did not make the gravy, just used the juice left in the pan.  I made some sauteed bok choy and rice with this wonderful dish.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!"
105471,216944,2007-10-05,4,This was a good and fairly quick recipe to make. I have repeated it with blueberries and honey as a topping with fair results.
379033,418958,2011-10-09,5,***MADE FOR FALL PAC 2011*** Rock on with this one! I really liked this salad. Perfect balance in the dressing. The dressing really goes well with what is going on in the salad. I used red onion only because I LOVE red onion with spinach. I omitted the mushrooms and the water chestnuts. All in all great recipe here.
227831,89439,2014-02-16,5,"I made this for Valentine&#039;s Day for DH and me and he loved it.  I admit, I used more cream cheese than called for and I think I might add lemon juice along with peel in the future but this was very good and very fast and it made my Valentine feel loved.  Thanks, PaulaG."
91453,17764,2003-11-19,5,"hie heather, thanks for the recipe. it really did make the rools 'glisten' - very appetizing indeed. i used the glaze on yogi's tasty buns. thumbs up!"
57256,51883,2003-08-13,5,"This is truly a strawberry delight !!!! I made this for a pot luck at work . I was worried about this holding up and not getting runny or mushy , as I was not serving it till the next day at lunch . It held up just fine and was really enjoyed by everyone ! Very good for a no-bake dessert !!! Thanks for posting . "
161815,144552,2007-03-15,5,"This pie is absolutely delicious!!!  I substituted Splenda for the sugar, used Egg Beaters and used only half the bourbon...it is a keeper.  This recipe is very easy and super tasty!  Thank you for posting."
1130636,61366,2012-08-17,5,This was SOOOO GOOD. Best Peach cobbler I have ever made and even my daughter that NEVER eats fruit of any kind--LOVED IT. It is soooo good. I had cut it in half and cooked it in the toaster oven =) YUMMY
160974,22349,2007-10-03,4,"I browned the meat and threw in the crock pot. I used half the water and omitted the tomato sauce since my kids don't like strong tomato based soups. I served this over mashed potatoes and it was delicious. Next time I might add some onion soup mix (dry), too.Mine turned out like Crafty Lady's photo.  Thanks Debe"
784827,303287,2010-03-14,5,"Yummy! I made this today with frozen mixed berried I had in the freezer, it was delicious! I had to substitute cranberry juice for apple as I was out, but otherwise made as described. I made this along with ""Brandied Custard Crepe Filling"" #323013 to go together in breakfast crepes, it was perfect!! I will be keeping this recipe, thanks for posting!"
179063,102655,2004-12-07,5,"These turned out perfect...very easy to make...I adapted the recipe by adding some lemon zest and a dash of cinnamon, that a gave a nice twist to a great Aussie fave!"
62191,32369,2003-09-03,3,The flavor was awesome!! But as other reviews had problems with crumbliness I did too. I did find after a few days it did not crumble near as bad. It made awesome french toast. Thanks for sharing the recipe. 
377581,16371,2008-02-08,5,"These were very good and so easy to make. I served them with refried beans. Thank you for posting, definately a keeper!"
595262,335333,2009-01-03,5,"Delicious and so easy!  I was out of peas so substituted french style green beans, very yummy! (I think asparagus would work well too) Love that you don't have to stand at the stove stirring for 20 minutes too.  It came out with a nice sauce, the rice still had a good bite to it, not at all mushy and the shrimp were cooked to perfection!  Even my husband who is not normally a fan of risotto really enjoyed it.  Thanks, this is a keeper!"
375385,197745,2009-10-23,5,Really hearty and tasty soup :) I added a few garlic cloves and some beef stock in addition to the vegetable stock because I had WAY more vegetables than called for - and beef stock was in my fridge. Served it with some cornbread to complete the meal.
323186,466093,2013-08-26,5,"Love fried rice and this is an excellent one, I virtually ate this all by myself!! ;)   Really loved the cashew nuts in this,  the fish sauce and lime juice add a whole new dimension to a classic favourite.  I chose to make a little omelette and slice it, rather than scramble the eggs in, just enjoy it that way :)   Marvellous recipe, Jackie, made for Taste Of Thai Challenge, ZWT9, Pink Panthers."
25792,52661,2003-02-21,5,"Excellant bread, the icing is the BOMB!  Great use of ingredients, a true repeat recipe and a winner with me!"
383346,318613,2008-08-23,4,I cooked it 8 hours at low.  The meat was tender.  I decided to not add the zucchini.  That way I was sure the meat would stay tender.  I felt like the taste needed something so at the end I stired in ketchup.  It could have been tomato paste but it was easier to use ketchup.  No waste.  I used 4 small roma tomatoes from my garden.  A bit more than 1 cup of baby carrot.  Thanks TAM.  Made for Newest Zaar Tag.
144897,54257,2011-04-14,5,"I thought this was totally outstanding.  I could eat it every night, and that's saying a lot because I don't usually eat much meat!  I used ground turkey instead of beef and bread crumbs instead of the slice of bread.  My dh thought it was just ok, which is a bummer for me but I might try using a little less vinegar next time and see if he likes it that way more.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! :)"
471700,307279,2009-04-21,5,"Hi Leslie,

I have made your cake now 3  ok maybe 4 times.  It is time consuming but well worth the effort.  I have been looking for this type of recipe for a long time THANK YOU.  I owned a bakery in Victoria B.C. and our recipe was very similiar.  Once again ""EXCELLENT"".  
P.S.  I always make this when I am home alone listening to great music and nobody to disturb me, turns out great every time."
107135,84977,2007-06-26,5,what an easy way to make  fried rice a really good idea  add   a little green onion too
136979,22782,2008-01-05,5,"Loved this recipe...I did rinse off the sausage after cooking it to get rid of some of the fat.  This recipe has a great smooth texture to the sauce.
Thanks"
2001670174,14670,2017-08-13,5,O my goodness!! I couldn't stop eating!
2000791993,8603,2016-01-01,5,I got a ninja blender for Xmas &amp; mixed it all up in there. Came out great!
32772,77780,2004-02-15,5,"My family loves brisket so when I saw this recipe posted I just had to give it a try and I am GLAD I did.  This is a very flavorable brisket and we so loved the Southwest Taste.  Served it with rice and corn. Spooned off the fat from the broth and thicken it with cornstarch and water. Oh, I forgot the most important part. I cooked this in my 6 quart Rival crockpot.I browned the brisket as stated in the recipe but had to cut it in half to fit in my crockpot. I didn't add the water because crockpot cooking makes its own moisture. I did though use 15 ounces of tomato sauce.  Thanks again for a true keeper."
1072593,501847,2015-03-20,5,This is a new one on me. Look here:  8-)  That&#039;s my surprise face. The kid&#039;s loved &#039;em.
578328,227560,2008-08-25,5,"These were great!  I shredded the carrot very fine, and no one ever knew they were included (and I'll never tell!).  My batch made 30 mini muffins, and the texture was great, they had just the right amount of ""rise"" and with a bit of extra cinnamon I passed them off as cinnamon muffins.  These will become a regular school-time snack.  Thanks!"
1229315,228537,2010-12-30,5,EXCELLENT - i've made this twice and it was perfect both times.
11297,44587,2002-11-26,5,"Great easy & very flavourful sauce.  Instead of wrapping the butter in wax paper I served mine in a small pretty dish so that we could put as much or as litle, or even keep adding the sauce to the steak.  Thanks for this keeper.  JenT  :)"
268411,119562,2006-04-30,5,"Easy, tasty, and my son wants them ""every day, mommy""! I love that they can be dropped in a Ziploc bag after they are frozen and cook so quickly. I made a strawberry syrup that was wonderful (1 cup sugar, 1 cup water, 2 T. cornstarch, 2 cups berries and 1 T. maple syrup, simmer until thick). I'll post it as I didn't find one in the zaar. Thanks for the recipe. "
78884,3594,2012-09-24,5,Used ranch dressing mix along with garlic herb spaghetti sauce for tomato sauce. I parboiled peppers and uncovered and topped with cheese for last 5 minutes
185142,58873,2005-01-14,5,"I used ground turkey instead of the ground beef, and I used salsa instead of the enchilada sauce. All I can say is outrageous! My DH loved them."
252514,423504,2013-01-27,5,"This is an excellent crepe batter. It works equally well for savory or sweet crepes, as I've tried it with both. I have been using a similar recipe for years, having no idea it was Julia. What a nice surprise! The only thing to be aware of is the 2 hour wait time before using (for the batter to rest). Thanks, Epi Curious."
2879184,278160,2013-11-20,5,"So glad to have this recipe! With being gluten free, those cream of anything soups are out of the question, and so were a lot of my casserole recipes. With a little tweaking (GF flour and stock), my family and I can now enjoy those classics again! Thanks for sharing!&lt;br/&gt;***EDIT*** I have since made the tomato condensed as written, and should have only had to add 1-11/2 cups liquid, but it was still way too thick. It took 3 cups of liquid to turn the condensed into the consistency of canned once thinned. It also needed a slightly richer tomato flavor. Next time, I will start with only half the base, and add tomato paste and sauce rather than juice. I will play with it and let you know. :)"
590105,239724,2008-04-11,5,This was really good and everyone liked it.  I did expect it to be weirder than it was.  It was really just savory.  It actually reminded me of corned beef.  :)  Reviewed for Aussie/NZ Recipe Swap #15.
364746,307956,2015-06-20,5,"I&#039;ve been making this recipe for a few years and it&#039;s always a big hit.  I am often requested to make it when we go to friends&#039; homes or to family gatherings.  Not only is it delicious, it is easy to make, has a nice crunchy texture and a beautiful colorful presentation.  Tip:  make sure the red seedless grapes are firm and sweet. I prefer them to be small in size.  If the grapes are large, I cut them in half, but make sure they are sweet.  This recipe is a keeper."
184723,38966,2005-02-01,5,"I do like cake mixes and prefer them most the time and this resembled that type of cake in consistency... I added more vanilla, still needed a little flavor but gave a ""5"" for the cake mix like texture! Thanks! Best homemade one I've ever made!"
171063,174631,2008-11-18,5,This recipe was nice and flavorful with the just amount of spice.  We ate it with chappatis along with green bean and carrot fry.  Thank you for sharing.
1006712,139766,2009-07-20,0,"We tried this recipe for a Hispanic pot luck, alas - most comments were negative. Way too sweet, and the ginger did nothing to improve it. Also, way too soupy. Won't make this again, sorry."
5290250,99909,2014-04-09,5,try this with a grated apple.  Yup a grated apple.  It adds a delightful flavor.  This a staple in our family.  Always enough for leftovers.....
282379,376357,2010-09-13,5,"Excellent and easy! I doubled the receipe and added all the spices to the flour. After frying the fish, I added about 1/2 cup of flour, 1 tsp. baking powder, and a little milk to my leftover flour-cornmenal mix. I fried this in the oil for hushpuppies. Turned out great!"
498271,245796,2008-02-05,5,This was absolutely delicious!!  The sweet and spicy glaze was superb and a perfect complement to this kind of steak.  I don't care for onions myself but hubby just loved the caramelized onion topping too.  We all just loved this dish!!
115309,40095,2003-11-30,3,It was very easy to make but I thought it ended up tasting more like regular pumpkin pie than I expected.  I might try to make some adjustments to the recipe to make it more like a cheesecake.
250034,223237,2009-08-01,5,This is a great recipe. No one could even tell it was chicken. I definetly would reccomend it to anyone.
240001,99156,2007-04-11,5,Very good!  I made this tonight with Thai noodles and it rocked!  I followed recipe to a tee except that I added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes for extra spice.  Will be making this again.  Thank you for sharing barb63.
287420,106355,2011-02-05,5,Tuna and hummus is a great combination! I trid this and added grated carrot too - put together in wholw wheat pita with some arugula leaves and I was very impressed thank you!
166642,258086,2008-08-27,5,These were a big hit in my house! My sons love brownies so I made some for them today to have when they came home from their first day of school. They raved about these. They are moist and oh so rich and chocolaty. They couldn't be easier to make either. Thanks for sharing.
1220185,110686,2010-01-23,5,Made it yesterday and we loved the crust. Thank you!
350750,350913,2014-12-24,3,These were good but probably will not make them again.  I thought they were lacking something.  I did like that these muffins did not have a lot of sugar.  Thank you!
652568,32690,2008-06-09,5,"Very easy to make, I used 3/4 cup of honey and 2 tbs of molasses instead of the packed brown sugar. Used Kellogs Sellect pecan, granola and raisin cereal. And only yogurt I had was vanilla. so used that instead. Even with those changes, excellant cookie treat for the kids in the summer. Wish I had found this months ago. Definately going into Christmas basket of goodies for family, friends and teachers. Thanks A TON for a GREAT RECIPE!!!!!"
140132,20824,2007-08-15,5,Very tasty burger.  The only diffrence I did was I added all the remaining soy sauce mixture instead of brushing it on.  This was a very moist and delicious burger.  We loved the mayo mixture and have used it for many things.  I served these burgers with a chinese salad #138897.  Thank you for a yummy burger recipe that I will be sharing with my family.....Stephanie
954555,335399,2008-11-07,3,"Not to bad my familly didn't care
for it though.  We usualy have tripe with beans , the Portuguese way, I will be posting that in the future. Thankyou Mightyro for posting"
1610338,224537,2013-10-19,5,"I don&#039;t know if my original review of this cake went through or not, so I&#039;ll post again.  I looove this coffee cake, and I was so upset when I lost my home and gardens book with this in it.  Thank you Barb for posting it!  I bring it to brunches, parties, and friends houses.  It&#039;s really easy, and always delights everyone.  I tend to make a few changes:  I leave out the nuts most of the time.  I use a packet or two of instant coffee instead of measuring (I have packets on hand, not a jar of the stuff).  I normally use pancake mix instead of biscuit, not sure if there&#039;s a difference, but I think it tastes better.  Also, be careful not to stir it too much, or you will mix in your swirl. The swirl makes this cake, once or twice through is enough.  Delicious!"
779126,107384,2008-03-09,5,"Delicious recipe. We cooked the chicken first then the onions, then put the chicken back in and did the rest. Was very good."
428885,63624,2008-08-03,5,"I just finished putting together *The Best Darn Way to Barbecue Chicken* and it lives up to it's name. I was scouting out some recipes that were different for grilled chicken; that had all the components that we dearly love, (using fresh herbs from the garden) and making a spectacular taste. This is it! I followed this to the *T* ~ except I cut down on the margarine to one stick, and added a bit (1 tablespoon) of homemade tomato sauce to the baste. Wowsiers! This is great! I was able to walk away from the grill for a bit, by putting the pieces (after browning them) into the middle of our gas grill, with the flames on either side, (middle part turned off) thus producing very succulent chicken pieces and no burned edges. Terrific Ridgely, and thanks!"
560491,391637,2014-05-04,5,I should have NOT made this...it is sooo good and addicting!!  It was quick and easy to whip up; I  put the cinnamon and sugar in a Ziploc and shook the biscuits to save on clean up.  Going into my Best of cookbook!  Made for Spring PAC 2014.
11176,217131,2008-06-01,4,"mmmMMMmmm.... very tasty! I'd be less liberal with the flaked salt next time because the sumac and lime tend to accentuate the sensation of saltiness. I let them bake about 1 minute longer for a bit more crispiness and color and the texture was fabulous!  I've also used flour tortillas in a pinch for the ""bread"" and everyone at the party I took them to raved. They were gone within minutes! I love the versatility of lavash; you could really let your imagination be your guide when thinking up toppings, but this method combined with the great ingredients made for a fantastic, well-loved snack. Thank you, Ninna, for posting!"
48902,420357,2011-10-15,5,Man if I could give this more than 5 stars I would!  Simple dish with lots of flavor.  Made as directed.  We ended up making 3 more salmon pieces so we could have 2nds.  Thanks Peterid for posting.  I will be making this recipe often.  Made for PAC Fall 2011
195137,27210,2005-06-19,4,"Easy and tasty. Next time, I'll marinade overnight. Two hours just gave a hint of flavor."
311003,169869,2007-10-26,5,"I made this last night, and what can I say other than fantastic! I browned the onions just a little, and did use about 3 cups of chicken broth in the stockpot.  Other than that, I followed your directions exactly.  My husband usually doesn't like turnips, but he did say these tasted very sweet when cooked this way -- and the addition of the picante sauce added a little zing.  (I also saved lots of time by buying the greens at our store that are prewashed and precut, so all I had to do was open the bags and put the greens right into the pot.)
Thanks for such a delicious recipe.  We all loved it!"
430098,96843,2007-08-09,0,"I can't wait to try this.  It is over 100 degrees here and HUMID -- is too hot to move sometimes let alone cook! Once it gets cooler ,this will be one of the first recipes I will try.  Think I'm changing my name to Can't Wait til Winter!  lol"
2000487462,5465,2015-09-20,5,"I love this sandwich fried or not, it&#039;s a delicious combo. One thing though, Elvis&#039; version of this sandwich has mayo and bacon on it!"
125388,134992,2010-07-10,5,"I made these using some leftover taco meat that I had in the freezer.  This was a really fun, different way to have tacos.  I cooked the potatoes in the microwave, then finished the filled spuds under the broiler.   I topped the potatoes with lettuce, tomato, taco sauce and sour cream after they came out of the oven.  Great quick, weeknight meal."
774665,105726,2008-11-29,5,Very good! Thanks again for another great recipe!
833875,396564,2010-05-14,5,I made these tonight with the exception that I used my own apple pie filling recipe.  Pretty much any filling you like can be used.  I was only able to get 16 pie pops out of two prepared pie doughs.  The dough stretches pretty far so you can fill these up with the filling.  They were delicious and incredibly cute!  I will be making these lots in the future!  Thank you for posting this recipe on here!  They are yum on a stick!
269331,5031,2010-01-29,5,I bought EmerilÃ¢â¬â¢s Essence from the grocery store that sat in my pantry and lost its flavorÃ¢â¬Â¦ so I made my ownÃ¢â¬Â¦ dumped the old stuff out and filled the bottle up with the new EmerilÃ¢â¬â¢s Essence spicesÃ¢â¬Â¦ fabulous!
354878,58828,2009-09-01,5,"I have been looking for a good pimiento cheese recipe forever.  Always just not quite right. Now I have it.  Added 2 jalepenos to it and cut back just a touch on the vinegar (I used apple cider vinegar) because of the peppers being in vinegar. Absolutely perfect.  Thanks BeachGirl. Now Mrs. Price will be loosing a customer for good.  No more over priced stuff for me, and so much better."
360437,200953,2007-02-11,5,"Yum! I loved this! I made exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. This is a very easy, yet impressive dish. I'll be making this again and again! Thank you!"
29196,477456,2012-11-25,5,Delicious! I used the mix of mushrooms you suggested plus oyster as well. I only got time to photograph the raw ones as our dinner guests fell on the cooked ones and demolished them in no time flat. Shall be definately be making these again!
461834,503620,2013-08-29,4,"What a nice change from my normal chex mix snack that I usually make around the holidays.  I liked the zip/heat from the Cajun seasoning.  I would definitely make this again, but with some tweaking for my tastes.  There wasn&#039;t near enough spice/oil mixture to evenly coat the mix, sometimes you get just plain cereal/pretzel/peanuts and then other times the mix is so strong in seasonings(cereals really absorb that mixture), it is overpowering.   But think with some changes, this could be a new favorite snack mix!!!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.  Made for ZWT 9."
149002,2891,2006-06-16,5,"I made this salad for an end of the year faculty school luncheon.  It was gone in a flash.  Great color and great taste.  I will be making this again.  Thank you.

121581,10510,2005-03-24,5,"This is a favorite summer dinner for my family.  I like to buy the ready-made whole wheat pizza dough from Trader Joes.  I just roll it out, brush with garlic olive oil, pierce with a fork in a few places, and prebake as above. I have also used a completely ready-made crust, which really cut down on the time but was a bit ""breadier"".  Easy and yummy!"
1663050,302120,2011-01-03,5,This is an excellent comfort food recipe.  My husband and I both had seconds; it was that good!  Thank you for posting this very easy and wonderful recipe.  We will make it again.
428885,159564,2010-06-20,5,"Lovely dip, Parsley! We have enjoyed this for ""Father's Day"" and used fresh horseradish from the garden and added 3 tablespoons, (as this was really, really, really, hot! when it's fresh) Oh please, if I go to the beyond, let me take this dip! Made for ZWT 6 - Zee Zesties - 2010"
148903,80607,2004-11-19,2,"Sorry, these just weren't our kind of cookie.  I'm pretty adept at cookie making, but found these to be a little too un-sweet for our tastes. I took the other reviewer's advice, rolled the logs in coconut prior to chilling - still found the coconut to be stubborn...would not stick well.  Perhaps too low a ratio of fats to dry ingredients.  I did not need to extend the cooking time, and used walnuts instead of pecans. Anyway, cheers!"
21107,29544,2002-08-05,1,"I am with reviewer Marcia Smith on this one. It was not bad but I don't think it deserves the highest rating 
on the site. I tried it and followed the recipe faithfully and was quite disappointed. I tasted as I thought it would ...sweet and
somewhat ho-hum. The best that can be said for it is that it is easy and for those with weak teeth, the chops are tender.
I would far rather marinate a  boneless pork steak and grill it. I have given it one star and am not sure it deservs that.
I prefer to give good reviews but this recipe has been so over-rated that I felt I should help to correct the balance."
2001631055,283370,2017-07-17,5,Turned out good! I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so put in one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of broccoli have way through baking I sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on top and finished baking sooooo good
394077,44888,2007-04-11,5,Excellent wings.  My family loves these.  I had to bake them  for 1 hour and 30 minutes to get the wings to caramelized.  It was worth the wait.  The only thing I would change is to reduce the soy sauce a bit.
192264,18914,2011-03-11,5,My kids loved this and it's so easy. Thanks!
237330,262726,2007-11-24,4,"This was a treat to make and to eat. I loved the flavour mix of onion, garlic, tomato and spinach, and the beans are a wonderful protein addition. I used 2 tsp of butter to saute the onion and garlic and substituted canned mixed beans for the butter beans.  I love the curry flavour and next time will increase it to 1 1/2 tsp. Healthy and tasty! Thank you, Kitzy :)"
2000923733,117404,2016-08-19,5,Excellent salad. Will use a little less EVOO but other than that 2 thumbs up!
319577,87782,2006-12-11,5,"I made these for dinner last night, they were soooo good. The lemon juice added great flavor. I love cooking with lemons, I don't know why I never thought to put them on roasted potatoes. I couldn't stop eating them! Thanks."
5060,376651,2009-09-03,4,"Delicious tilapia , nice and spicy.  When I make it again, I will add the green onion and garlic later, by the time the tilapia was cooked the onion and garlic were way overdone. But even at that it was delicious and I will make it again.   I just used the cajun seasoning, looked and looked and cannot find creole seasoning in stores here.  (I will try to find a recipe for creole seasoning next time.)  also just used 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  Thanks for posting a very tasty fish dish!"
177933,80536,2005-10-14,5,"Wow, this was incredible.  First let me say that my husband does not like beef stew and the only reason I decided to try this is the hoisin, which he loves (oh, and the 22 5 star reviews were also in infulence).  He thought this was wonderful and definately wants it again and often.  He even said it was guest worthy, which one does not usually say of a stew.  I only used 2 1/2 1bs. of stew meat (already cut up) which worked out just fine because we love lots of sauce.  I used a fabulous bottle of 2001 BV costal cabernet, which was also wonderful.  I followed your directions completely except that after adding the carrots I cooked for an hour because the carrots took that long to get the way we like them.  I also added a couple of handfuls of frozen peas at the end.  In my mind I think mashed potatoes should go with beef stew, so I made potatoes and egg noodles.  I must add that the flavor was way more enhanced by the noodles and I won't make potatoes with it again.  Like other reviewers I did not need to add the cornstarch it was perfect without it.  Thanks so much for sharing what is a new family favorite."
228458,224633,2011-01-17,5,"This was a great recipe! I made them for DS's 3rd birthday this weekend and they were very well received. FWIW this recipe works great with chocolate cake mix (still added the vanilla but may try espresso in the future), and it works fine as a full sized cake as well. I used about 3/4 of the batter in a Spider Man cake pan and the rest in muffin cups--this makes a very fluffy batter that goes pretty far. I will be making these again this week for his school party--thanks so much for posting!!"
229624,112365,2005-07-17,5,"These are good, but why not add the ranch dressing mix to these, it is awesome!  JJ"
461209,30965,2007-10-21,5,"yum. cut the recipe in half, came out perfect with vegetarian lentil stew."
121113,67482,2007-12-25,5,"We loved these meatballs.  I added the garlic chile paste to the meatball mixture instead of the glaze.  I baked them in a 350 degree oven.  Tossed them with some Thai Sweet Chile Sauce, and nuked them for a couple minutes.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks for a great recipe."
230834,54299,2005-08-16,5,Very tasty!  I'm always looking for breakfast ideas that I can eat on the go.  This one is good. Thanks!
160977,300004,2008-05-19,4,"Used the version with coconut milk. Found it a little bland and upped the taste with 1/2 tsp brown sugar and 1 1/2 tbs mustard. Also used 1/2 tsp salt. Think I will add a little more red pepper flakes next time and maybe even substitute another cup of water for coconut milk. It is a nice recipe, makes a lot, freezes well. It seems a bit soupy at first but when served over rice the ""soupyness"" disappears. All in all I am very pleased I tried this and will certainly make again.
Thanks for posting."
714533,108364,2008-01-03,5,This was awesome only change I made was to mixe the seasoning blend into the flour which is how I make my chicken anyway.  I will use this sauce mix from now on it makes the chicken very tasty.  I thought it would be too spicy but it wasn't it had just the right amount of kick.
189280,296700,2008-09-09,5,"What a beautiful dish! And boy, did I look like a pro with this. I've seen chefs on TV use this technique, so I was familiar with it. The shrimp steamed beautifully on a bed of couscous. I did saute the onions first (personal preference) and I added lemon zest to the shrimp before the pesto. It was an easy, impressive dish. I used the microwave to heat the chicken stock in a measuring cup and mixed the couscous right into that, so there was very little cleanup. I will be making this again.  Thanks so much for posting!"
333017,136292,2013-02-05,5,"Nice, easy recipe that had a full bodied flavour!  Instead of adding the sugar, I added abut 1/8 to 1/4 tsp cinnamon which gave it a nice touch.  I made this recipe primarily to added to other dishes that called for marinara sauce, so I am looking forward to seeing how they turned out.  Going by the taste of this marinara sauce,  they should be excellent!!!  Kudos on a great posting!!"
1186060,51780,2009-04-19,3,"This was my first attempt at eating kale.  My husband liked it, but it wasn't a favorite of mine.  I'll probably try kale in a different recipe next time."
323134,210534,2009-10-29,5,"This soup was very easy to make and it was tasty and delicious.  However, I made some changes.  I used 2 lbs. of chicken thighs which I cut up into pieces and sauteed it in 2T of butter with one diced onion.  Then I added 2 T. of ""Better Than Bouillon Chicken Base"" (it comes in a bottle), the 6 cups of water, 2- 3 carrots cut up into  pieces, 4 stalks of thinly sliced celery,and 1 cup of two inch pieces of spagetti noodles (uncooked and broken into 2-inch pieces).  Cooked all the ingredients together for about 3 - 4 hours. Seasoned it with salt and pepper. The soup was outstanding and it looked like Marg CaymanDesigns picture.  This is a keeper!!"
52448,39808,2009-03-31,5,"We absolutely loved this dish!! I used 1 heaped teaspoon grated  fresh ginger and maybe that is why it was not too salty. Next time I will also use fresh garlic. I only marinated the chicken for 2 hours but will do it overnight the next time since we like the bourbon flavor and that seems to get stronger after marinating the chicken longer. Served it with noodles and a veg stir fry. As a plus , it was also very easy to make...many thanks!"
17803,254208,2008-01-01,5,Served this tonight for our company and it was a big hit.  There was 7 of us and I made a batch and a half.  Good thing as there was not a drop left!  I cut the tomatoes in half so they would absorb some of the oil/vinegar mixture.  Thanks for posting I plan on making this again.
2041715,58862,2011-10-30,5,This was a really wonderful and easy recipe. I made a couple changes - I used ground turkey instead of beef and used one onion and a cup of water in place of the soup (couldn't find onion soup at the grocery store). This is my go-to chili recipe!
2002031607,2886,2018-03-05,5,Great recipe! The banana loaf top is really crunchy with brown crust and is moist in the center.
291378,332359,2009-03-26,4,"This is a tasty, healthy recipe.  My husband and son both enjoyed it as well."
274212,34335,2011-08-25,5,Loved the flavors of this tasty roast.  I did end up marinatin for 24 hours and it was gobbled up in one setting.  Thanks for posting and plan to try with other roasts.
129201,222360,2008-08-14,5,"Easy, quick and full of flavour!!  I subbed chopped chili in a jar for the chili flakes and discovered, in the middle of the recipe, that I had a scant tablespoon of dijon left so made up the rest with wholegrain mustard.  I spooned the sauce over the breasts and cooked as per the recipe. I think I will make up some of the sauce and freeze it for those times when I can't be bothered with cooking!  Thanks for a tasty dinner Jan."
186070,44729,2005-10-30,5,"This is excellent, it was fast, easy and delicious. I made it almost exactly as written except I mixed the 1/4c. of sugar and the 3 t. of cinnamon together then mixed it into the apples with about 1 t. lemon juice. I also added about 1 t. vanilla and a pinch of nutmeg to the batter and baked it in a springfoam and pan and it was perfect. Thank you for this wonderful recipe."
14410,305569,2008-06-04,5,"Delicious, moist muffins. I stretched the batter to fill 12 cups, so the muffins were smaller, which I prefer for my kids. The sugar on top...about 1/8tsp each....really added a nice touch. I'll definitely be making these again soon! Please note....they only needed to bake about 10 minutes at this size."
330505,109996,2010-02-21,5,"Okay, I thought when I took it out of the oven that this was going to be a flop..but this stuff is GOOD.  I was very bad and had two helpings of it!   I used tomatoes with onions and celery and because it wasn't the full 19 oz, I added a little bit more of the water. It may have turned out a little dryer than normal, but it was still quite yummy!  Thanks for posting!  Made for I Recommend Tag Game."
206747,284866,2009-03-07,4,"Saw the previous review and prepared with additional tiny cubed potato and slivered shallott, saureed in a tad of bueer and olive oil befor adding to the egg mixture.  Baked at 350 for 34 minutes, in a quiche baker, and allowed to sit about 5 minutes before serving.  It only required a little salt,  Fresh herbs not in season, but will use them next time.  Thanks for posting."
1715480,103961,2013-01-12,5,"This was simply AMAZING!  I liberally salted and peppered the meat, browned it, and in the same pan cooked the apples I put together (Putting the meat to the side to rest). My apples had 1/2 cup brown sugar, a 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and 2-3 tablespoons flour, and a small onion.  I added a splash of water to get them cooking.   I did the rest as directed, using the oven safe pan that I had cooked everything in, then reducing the cooking time because my chops were rather thin. (15 min covered, 10 uncovered) I have never made pork chops that were so flavorful and moist!  I want to make this again and again.  This is most definitely a keeper!"
679953,342046,2009-05-17,5,"Great dinner last night.  I doubled it so the 4 of us could have enough.  I did omit the chili flakes though.  All in all it was a GREAT filling tasty recipe,  Made for 1-2-3 hit wonders."
228978,4627,2008-02-15,5,"This was very yummy and filling.  I added mexican blend cheese and monterary jack, b/c I love cheese."
1381618,430374,2010-07-26,4,"Looks like this is the Lays chips recipe from their Tangy Carolina BBQ flavor. Original calls for everything you listed, except 1/3 c spicy brown mustard, and it's only cooked on high for 3-4 minutes, or until the sauce is reduced by 1/3 - stirring occasionally. Salt and pepper to taste at the end. Very yummy recipe, to me, it is very tangy and a little taste of spice."
340141,94460,2006-08-16,5,This is the exact same recipe as my favorite spinach recipe!  The only differences are that I use only 1/4 c. butter (and Benecol worked fine) and used 1.5 cups of Heart Smart American Cheese.  Just can't recommend it enough as a painless way to each spinach and/or have as a vegetarian meal.
355637,28040,2009-09-04,4,"Very good! Served with buffalo sauce, and was even tastier!"
332876,28768,2006-10-27,5,"This recipe was GREAT!! My husband is not really a cheese lover, but for this lasagna, the cheese didn't matter. This is definitely a keeper. "
262966,88173,2008-09-10,5,"This was very good!!  I had to make some adjustments, only b/c of what I had and didn't have onhand.  I used a jar of spaghetti sauce rather than the diced tomatoes and tomato paste, and I didn't have any artichoke hearts.  But other than that, I made it as written and it was a very good pasta dish.  Made a lot so we will have some yummy leftovers!!  Oh yea, I used bowtie and macaroni pasta only b/c they were both half full boxes that I wanted to use up!!"
2796083,151111,2013-04-22,1,"This recipe is horrible....I don&#039;t know why it has 5 stars....nothing like McDonald&#039;s....I followed the recipe to a T and my fries turned very brown, almost burnt during the second fry....when they came out they were crispy and 1 minute later they were limp...what a waste of tme"
2001746572,155670,2017-10-10,5,"I made it this morning in the break room at work. Very simple, about as easy as it gets! Made the mistake of using a tablespoon of butter instead of a teaspoon but that was easy enough to correct. Highly recommended."
124449,208406,2007-02-13,4,"This tasted very good, but I thought the sauce was too thin.  Next time I'll probably try using only 1 to 1 1/2 C water.  The flavor was definitely good, though, so it's worth some ""tinkering"".  I did add some garlic, but then I add garlic to almost everything!  Thanks for posting!"
219942,144997,2010-04-04,5,"Fabulous, thanks for a new vegetable side! I used dried bread crumbs, (being lazy) and they browned up and worked very well. the kids didn't like it(go figure0, but we sure enjoyed it! Different and a keeper! Thanks kitty's friend!"
28168,62689,2005-06-03,5,"We used our handy dandy crockpot to cook the meat during the day and assembled right before dinner. My 9 & 10 yr old boys declared the chimichangas delicious, just like a bean burrito, with meat. My husband thought it was great as well. I omitted the cayenne and wished I had picked up avocados to make some guac. Yummy!"
312208,229205,2009-12-04,5,"Great recipe!  We doubled the recipe and cut the sugar by over half (both in the batter and on top) and didn't miss it.  It was still plenty sweet, especially with a little maple syrup drizzle.  Also added chopped pecans for a little added texture and it was wonderful.  Thanks Jess!"
223169,114311,2006-08-07,5,"This is so easy to make, but full of pepperines. I love it. The butter is made in seconds and I like the lemon in here. It just add a wonderful fresh note to the garlic and parsley. For the tuna steak I have used black pepper, but also some white, green and red for adding some colour. I crashed the pepper in a mortar with a pistill. I broiled the tuna for about 3 minutes, so that the tuna was pinkish inside (I like my tuna this way). Wonderful flavours. At first it sounded much pepper, but I love the pepper here and it could have been even more. Together with the butter this is an awesome and easy to make fish dish, if you don't overcook the tuna steak. Thanks."
868626,609,2008-09-28,5,"I added in 1 tsp. Garlic Chili Sauce to the spice mix for a little added flavor, as it blends so well with Chinese and Thai ingredients.  My DD and I had a feast!  Yummy!"
30716,62236,2003-07-04,4,This was an interesting blend. Quite tasty and healthy. I don't know if I'll make it again but I did enjoy trying it and was surprised at the rich chocolaty flavour.
694852,95161,2010-01-21,5,Fantastic recipe! I remember my mom making this from a recipe she got from my grandmother.  Had to use lemon juice in place of vinegar and it still turned out very well. Served it over egg noodles with french bread on the side. :)
757434,314770,2008-12-21,5,"I have tried several crock pot pork chop recipes and this one was voted as the favorite for our family!  I did add 1/4 teaspoon of pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of paprika for a little zip to it.  The gravy was delicious over the mashed potatoes.  Even my youngest, who never eats gravy on her mashed potatoes loved it!  I bet you could dice up potatoes too and just throw them in with the pork chops and that would be good as well.  Thanks for the recipe!  It was great!"
424680,395399,2009-10-31,5,"This is definitely an unusual soup for my table, & a great conversation starter, too! I made it as written & included the 3 garnishes! Loved the blended flavors & the ease of preparation, & will make this one again! [Tagged, made & reviewed in Please Review My Recipe tag]"
1408182,111776,2009-10-20,5,Great recipe!! I cooked the onions before and added some fresh garlic (which i also cooked) but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. The texture was perfect!! Will definitely make again! This would also be a great meatball recipe. Double the sauce and serve over rice. Thanks!
756769,195260,2011-11-29,5,Super fast easy chowder that both my boys liked :)
145593,79032,2004-06-11,5,"I have this same cookbook and have made this tart many times. It always tastes great, and even though it has a lot of steps it is pretty easy to make. I use a microplane to finely grate the zest, so I skip step #9 here. I also skip whipping the cream; I just whisk it into the batter as is. If you really like a \"
142875,26337,2004-08-07,5,My Family loves this Brisket even though they rarely eat Beef . I use HoneySmoke KC Masterpiece sauce which taste even better .
231057,135585,2009-10-07,5,I loved this chicken!  Didn't use celery seed or blue cheese dressing but it was great!  Wrapped it in a tortilla with low fat mozz cheese...perfect!  Thanks for a great recipe.
411647,197725,2009-05-20,5,"This soup was write up my alley.  I'm surprised I'm the 1st to review it.  I was looking for something to use up some halibut and we love spicy mexican food.  It made quite a bit and if you wanted it to be less brothy, you could add less broth.  Added some nice bread and it was a perfect dinner."
2114562,84612,2016-04-30,5,"I have made this recipe several times. My daughter love, love, loves this version. Previously I have been using the Barefoot Contessa recipe, which is much heavier and more coffee flavored. I have made it with traditional hard and soft lady fingers. My family agrees the soft ones are much better with this recipe. So easy to make, less ingredients and just the right amount of sweetness."
185387,140731,2005-10-11,5,"Excellent recipe, I make this too all the time and is really good comfort food..
Thanks for sharing a great recipe nanalee."
307751,88489,2012-12-29,4,Delicious cookies! Taste like brownies. I only gave it 4 stars because the vinegar and vanilla should be added before the sugar to stabilize the egg whites and the cookies come out better if piped out of a pastry/icing bag.
1295498,82102,2010-08-12,5,"This was fabulous! I made it last night and our friends and my husband loved it. Hubby said he was skeptical when I told him what I was making, but he has already asked me to make it again. Next time I may try it with the sauce and mozz."
1272346,99272,2009-06-13,5,"Amazing taste - super easy - a huge hit at our house! Followed recipe exactly and put in fridge overnight. I won't be buying canned ones EVER again!!
Thanks for posting this great recipe!!"
495821,20158,2008-05-17,5,I used Red wine vinegar and EVOO and we loved it!  Salad was delicious!
502207,62254,2008-05-28,5,"These are great and you'd never guess they were good for you.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used some frozen, overripe bananas and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Also, I didn't have any applesauce, so I subbed some homemade pear butter.  And I made it a tad healthier by grinding my own whole wheat flour.  Thanks for the great recipe.  YUM!"
39636,243246,2007-10-02,4,"A good hearty lentil and vegie soup.  Quick and easy. A Sunday night meal knocked up in no time.
The acid from the lemon brings out the flavour of the lentils and I felt it tonned down the flavour of the tomatoes.  This is a keeper.  I have been eating this soup for lunches this week.  Thank for posting."
88099,465933,2012-04-08,3,"We enjoyed this and I suspect that it will be even better the longer it sits, but it was a little bland for us.  I would adjust the ingredients to add more heat and flavor.  More cilantro and jalapenos would be great.  I may drain some of the liquid from the tomatoes also.  I only used 8 oz of cream cheese as we felt that was plenty.  Another 8 oz we thought would overpower the other ingredients.  Thanks for sharing.  A recipe worth playing with.  Made for PAC Spring 2012."
740534,77677,2008-02-18,5,These were scrumptious cookies! I used margerine spread instead of butter and Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese to lighten it up and it turned out fine. They do taste a lot like cheesecake when they're warm. Great recipe!
257993,127690,2006-06-04,5,I thought it was very good!
424680,195712,2008-10-19,5,"I'm one of those who can do without a lot of salt, so with cut it way back & had no problem with the resulting cornbread, which is ABSOLUTELY GREAT & FULL OF FLAVOR! Certainly is a make-again kind of recipe, & thanks for sharing it! [Tagged, made & reviewed for one of my adoptees in the current Pick-A-Chef]"
522086,376233,2009-09-21,0,"Oh my gosh!!  I used to make this dish years and years ago and loved it!  I forgot all about it until I saw your recipe.  Thanks, can't wait to make it again!"
362546,238519,2012-07-06,5,"These were really good! Made a couple of adjustments, I couldn't find any creamy italian dressing, so I just used the regular stuff, and I put them under the grill rather than in the oven. I think next time I'll do them in the oven because the grill melted the cheese just fine, but I think they'd be better if they heated all the way through. All in all though, they were extremely good!!! (and easy!) Just as I remember them being at Pizza Hut when I was a kid! Thank You for this, they will definitely become a regular feature at our house!!"
1266744,21826,2009-12-04,5,"This was my first time to make cabbage, and my husband was sure that he hated it. When I finished cooking and he smelled it.. he had to try it, and now he LOVES it. We make this a couple times a month. Thank you so much!!"
1130338,128566,2009-11-19,5,"Great comfort food recipe and a great use of leftover turkey too! I used turkey and home-made turkey stock. It has a nice thickness to the filling, and a really good proportion of meat to vegetables to sauce. Did two pie pans (like Chef Barry... thanks!). Appreciate your great winter dish breezymom!"
37449,252936,2012-03-20,5,Easy and yummy to drink. I used 1 cup soy milk and 6 strawberries. This made a great breakfast this morning. Made for Pick a Chef(PAC) event spring 2012.
1536911,155008,2010-02-24,5,This pie is so delicious! My husband just loves it too.This is my favorite recipe for lemon chess pie.We make it every year for Thanksgiving and it's usually the first pie to get eaten.I just use a frozen crust but I would like to try it with a graham cracker crust sometime.It's got such a delicious tart yet sweet lemony flavor and a creamy texture.The top gets slightly crisp..yum! I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe..it's the best!
2072915,318471,2011-11-20,5,"I love this soup because it's so versatile. I made it last night with zucchini and Mexican gray squash, diced canned tomatoes, and added shredded cabbage. I didn't have any carrots or spinach, but with the extra squash and cabbage it was great anyway."
20480,20662,2005-08-15,5,Thank you for this easy to make/ really great recipe; I added 2 crushed garlic cloves.Will be making this again!My DH loved it.
494671,113015,2008-05-05,5,Very tasty meal. My husband was still talking about it the next morning. We'll probably skip the mint sauce next time but will definitely make the lamb this way again. Thanks!
1527624,150863,2010-01-20,5,Absolutely AMAZING...add more potatoes and melt the cream cheese!! I made a double batch and it was gone in less the 24 hrs.
51011,120413,2005-06-07,5,My dh absolutely loved these wings! They were so flavorful and good.  I have to say that they were very tasty.  Thanks so much for sharing!
82663,16918,2003-06-23,4,"This is a good recipe; tasted a bit like carrot or spice cake. I halved the reciped and baked it in an 8x8 cake pan for ~30 min. Still worked fine. For the frosting, I didn't have the canned cream or milk so I used half-and-half. That didn't work as well... it was more like a sauce. I poured it on any way and still tasted great. There are only 2 of us and we ate it the whole thing within an hour or two. (Ate dessert before dinner!) Will make this one again! "
101732,76244,2007-12-20,5,"Leah-This made for a very tasty lunch! I used sourdough bread,a slice of cheese on each side to hold it all together,sliced cherry tomatoes(I think that home grown would be fantastic!),black forest ham,low-fat mayo and Italian seasonings...didn't have oregano. This made a great warm sandwich for such a cold Winter day...Thanks!! :)"
545571,128988,2007-07-26,1,"Good flavor, but not baking in a tube pan is a big mistake.  The whole center was raw.  Do not recommend baking this at all."
1302650,258429,2017-03-11,5,"I'm so glad I found this recipe back as I hadn't saved it. This recipe is so simple and very good. When I've decided it's done cooking, I take out and cool, to get it cut into beautiful slices. I've saved recipe this time and printed out also."
2014756,18599,2014-11-11,1,The WORST potato soup recipe I have ever made. Extremely bland with no flavor.
183767,233487,2007-11-19,5,loved this recipe!!!
179908,103643,2004-12-12,5,Excellent bread. I omitted the fruit and went for the caraway seed only as in a more traditional bread and was well pleased. Served it with dinner and it was a hit with everyone. This is one of the best soda bread recipes I have tried and one I will continue to use.
27443,108522,2007-09-16,5,"This is great, will use it on all my grilled sandwiches from now on!
Thanks for sharing."
652568,20155,2011-06-26,5,"This is a great recipe Karen! I did change it up a little bit.. and even with using what I had on hand the potato salad didn't suffer.. I didn't have any red onion and didn't want the harshness of the yellow I had so I steamed some shallots and let them cool off and tossed them in.  I used my homemade mayo and mustard as well as my own put up relish. I used regular vinegar, was had on hand and cut down on the pepper, personal family preference. I did add two more eggs after reading Rayna's addition. I used young celery from my garden as well. This was a show stopped at today's cookout. People loved it.. thanks again for posting a great recipe..."
24485,297366,2008-08-06,4,"I prepped everything ahead of time and then started it and a bowl of angelhair pasta in the microwave at the same time. Eight minutes from start of cooking to dinner. Great for a quick, tasty elegant dinner. My only problem was thinking of cooking the basil for several minutes. I waited until the very end to add it. I wish I could have reduced the vinegar a bit more but did not want to toughen the scallops."
1012192,29591,2008-11-02,5,"Oh my goodness! These were the BEST fried pickles!  Even my husband, who isn't a fan of pickles, loved these!  We couldn't get enough of them!  I did need to add 1/2+ cup of beer to thin out the batter but no biggie.  We like them a bit more spicy so we added some chili powder.   Whether you're usng small round pickle slices or larger spears, this is a great recipe...personally, we prefer the thin round slices. :)  The beer definitely makes this batter.  Thank you SO much for posting this recipe.  God bless!"
749838,90139,2008-02-23,4,Made this when we didn't have any cream on hand. It was pretty good! It set up a lot better after spending the night in the freezer.
140132,57872,2011-02-07,5,This is a fantastic dip!  I made this for a super bowl party we were invited to and everyone loved it.  This is a keeper for sure.  Its easy to make and has very few ingredients.  I served this with triscuit crackers and ruffles.  Thank you for sharing.
1677099,17977,2013-05-05,5,Tasty and easy.  I used this recipe for my gyro testing.  Great recipe.  Used the dough hook in kitchen aid mixer.  It was a humid day and I had to add quite a bit more flour.
1778005,43112,2010-12-28,4,My family loves this dish.  Great use for leftover ham. My recipe calls for 2 TBSP dry white wine and 1/3 cup pimentos.
501778,89207,2009-01-04,5,"This frosting was GREAT, I topped a yellow cake with it and I ended up going back for seconds of frosting! THANKS"
889287,68272,2008-07-18,5,"Awesome recipe. Definitely worth the effort of the risings and rollings etc. I cooked this for about 5 minutes on each side, then turned the oven off and made a smoked salmon spread by MarieAlice to serve them with. They were firmer and cripy on some edges in the end. Perfect in my eyes!!"
461283,49977,2008-06-11,5,"Karyl Lee, great recipe! I used as a pizza spread/topping and added some fresh diced hot peppers and grated mozzarella. DD made hers with mozz and sliced baked aggplant. Delicious!"
37449,411854,2010-04-22,5,"So good! I used some basil I had frozen from the garden, scaled the recipe down to make one nice sandwich. Thanks! Made for PAC(pick a chef) in the contests forum."
115621,91344,2010-07-18,5,Very Tasty Greffette! I used Emeril's Seasoning since that's easier for me to obtain. I love pieces of garlic cut into the pork loin. Searing the loin is something I also have always done but I used to do that right on my stove before putting it on the grill. This time I decided to try doing it on the grill and it worked great. The beer and pork combo was good. I can imagine making it in the oven would make a good gravy over some garlic potato mashed potatoes or some nice rice. Thank you for a great recipe.
2130668,7945,2012-01-01,5,"I made this for supper last night (new years eve) it gave 6 of us a generous serving each and tasted heavenly, and this is from some- one who has never liked tomato soup and made it because rest of family do! Will definitely make it again. I left the mushroom out because I am the only person that likes mushrooms! It was a hit with everybody. Thank you."
383346,499931,2013-05-24,5,These pancakes are so good.  They were perfect.  Thanks Pumpkin :)  Made for Name that ingredient tag game
2000519559,25885,2015-10-18,5,Just made this and its so AMAZING!! I added 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract and chocolate chips. Besides that I followed the recipe exactly. The banana bread didn&#039;t even have a chance to cool down all the way before it was gone. Thanks for this recipe!! :)
310749,325117,2008-12-01,4,"Read the description carefully!  I always thought of risotto as a side dish.  This one is a MEAL in a big way.  It makes a LOT.  I think the only thing it needs is more cheese, but otherwise, very good.  Thanks for posting!"
415934,316804,2008-08-25,2,"This didn't work for me.  I was pretty disappointed in this recipe.  The rolls didn't rise well so they were pretty dense.  I felt like they needed a little more salt.

I followed the recipe exactly so I didn't use a greased pan (though I had a little inner argument about whether or not I should since I'm not a complete baking newbie) -- needless to say, half of each roll had to be soaked off the baking sheet."
202661,113926,2005-05-09,0,"I am anxious to try this.  I love the combination of spices and whether or not you know it, this is a great LOW CARB recipe.  40# gone and maintained for 4 years! "
1356794,129926,2009-08-19,5,"These were absolutely delicious! There's absolutely nothing wrong with this recipe! Thank you, Deb!"
336058,211302,2007-11-19,5,"Made this for Please Review and took it to work (we had a taco type meal).  Everyone, even the ""Mexicans,"" loved it.  I doubled it and it's so easy to put together.  Didn't use low-fat cheese, but used low-fat cream cheese."
115758,120353,2006-05-16,5,"YUMBO!! Garlic lovers will love this bread! It's nummy n crunchy on the outside but ever so light and fluffy on in the inside. I had some of the garlic mixture left over this time so next time will reduce this slightly.I made 2 large round loaves but next time will make smaller size loaves and serve them stuffed with tomatoes, prosciutto and mozzarella for lunch! Mmmmm"
39301,271438,2009-08-10,5,"Great soup!  I topped with a few crushed tortilla chips and a little shredded cheddar, which added to the points, but I can live with hat when there is only 1 point in a cup to start with!  We all loved it and will certainly make it again."
81611,86564,2004-03-15,4,"Actually, these turned out 1-star for me, but it might be my mistake. I think I beat the egg whites too long? They came out flat, and because I didn't know how long to cook them (no approx. time given), they burned, even though I tried to keep a close eye on them. They never cracked, probably because they were so flat. *sigh*"
578380,347087,2009-01-14,0,"So far, 5 stars!  I modified this for my life and my family.  I used Upstate New York venison steak cubes, which are very lean, skipped the parsley because I don't have any and it's 6* outside, and used a drained, 16 oz. bottle of home canned roma tomatoes instead of a can of plum tomatoes. The tomatoes should be equivalent.  I'm also not making a piecrust, as I have a pre-made one that needs used up.  The stew smells fabulous, and the spices are just so aromatic you might think of Belly Dancing and trips abroad. This is going into a casserole dish with one crust on top, as a potpie variation.  I'll keep you posted if it doesn't turn out as fabulous as it started!"
51011,31925,2004-11-25,5,"These are so simple and good!  I made these potatoes for our Thanksgiving Feast today... even my super picky dh who thinks everything should be made traditional enjoye them.  Only change I made was to add a bit more butter, and a little salt to the final product.  Thanks for sharing CanaryGirl :)"
2128707,274955,2012-03-18,4,The reviews were right. This was very fast and very good. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken. I also had a bit of leftover mashed potatoes and added those. Delish! Also I had a bit of leftover grated mozz cheese and added that into the mixture. Made it extra cheesy. Turned out great. Everyone went back for seconds and thirds!
724631,367708,2013-12-27,5,"Perfection, I knew Sydney Mike would have an excellent lemon dessert!  I did not strain, and the small bits of lemon zest did not detract.  This may become my &quot;go-to&quot; dessert.  It is important to have good quality fresh lemons.  My pudding was not overly tart.  I will probably swoon when I use Meyer lemons next time!  (The recipe made 5 small custard cups.) Made for Zaar Stars tag game.  This is one of my favorite recipes of all time, not just 2013!"
623122,116029,2007-12-05,4,"Tasty, and very easy to make. I used crunchy peanut butter and added about half a teaspoon of sugar to cut some of the bite from the vinegar."
424680,455060,2011-06-07,5,"Have had black bean salsas before, but your recipe, with the addition of mango, makes the salsa especially tasty & enjoyable! Definitely a recipe worth keeping! We had some of it as a dip with large corn scoops, & also enjoyed it over chicken breasts! Thanks for sharing it! [Made & reviewed in New Kids on the Block recipe tag]"
222564,190116,2010-11-17,5,"Great Italian flare recipe for mushrooms and panzanella both, together or separately. I did not have smoked mozzarella, used the usual kind. Very tasty anyhow!"
156966,100092,2004-09-27,5,"This was easy and very good,
we all liked it,I added a 
tiny bit of orange zest
ummm good:)"
119466,83547,2005-09-02,5,"This was delicious--it was moist and tasted rich, rather than low fat! I followed the directions as written, except I just whisked the dry ingredients together well and skipped the sifting. It was done right at 50 minutes. I topped with your Mocha Mint Glaze (#87509) and it was very good as well. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! "
931627,414883,2010-10-03,5,Easy to make. Bakes up quickly too and so YUMMY!
325160,299628,2008-07-03,5,"What a fantastically easy and delicious recipe!  I made this pretty much exactly to recipe, and it was perfectly spicy for me.  I baked some fresh and froze some.  When I thawed and baked those, they were just as good as the fresh chimichangas.  I was very pleasantly surprised!  I actually only made 6, I froze the filling from the other 4 for the next time I make tacos, I think it will work wonderfully.  Thank you for a fantastic, easy, OAMC recipe."
29956,13656,2003-03-13,5,"Nothing to change,a family member who is not overly keen on sprouts said they were alright, which is a huge compliment. I loved them. I did add the chilli flakes for extra zap."
2071993,31128,2011-11-19,5,"Absolutely amazing recipe.  I made mini apple pies (tarts), decreased the temperature to 325 and decreased the cooking times by about 10 minutes and they've turned out incredible!"
102058,220846,2008-12-12,4,"I made this twice, the first time I didn't grind up the oatmeal finely before adding the other ingredients and the second time I did. The second attempt tasted better  I think... less  of the tiny little ""bits"".  Please see my Rating System: 4 stars for a tasty refreshing smoothie.  Thanks!"
2001045574,224681,2016-06-11,2,4TBS of chili powder is way too much! I used two and one would of been enough! Family thought it was edible...
169430,242462,2007-07-31,5,"I made this for DH, tapioca is his favorite pudding (and he loves puddings!). He rated it at a solid 5 stars. To quote him ""Everything is just right"". Sweet but not too sweet, a touch of spice but not overpowering. Very easy to make, just follow the clear directions and you can't go wrong. This full recipe made two DH servings and a smidgen. I just might double it next time as this will be gone before bedtime."
988578,237490,2011-06-17,5,"This was awesome. Easy, quick, perfect for something healthy to-go. I don't have a grill so I just baked it for 25-30 minutes at 350 degrees. Delicious! I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!"
255338,151829,2008-09-02,5,"The dried thyme that I used was rather old, and so was the bottle of balsamic vinegar. Even so, this dish was enjoyed by my children. I am going to get fresh bottles of herbs, and a good balsamic vinegar and make this dish again... I am betting that it will then be so much more delicious. Thank you for posting."
167527,103269,2004-11-04,5,I have been making this same recipe for years.  In addition I always add 2 slices of bacon for flavor and a tsp of sugar to prevent the beans from causing people to have gas.
219865,90080,2009-07-02,3,"I liked it more than my husband did, he said it wasn't bad but there are things he likes better that use similar ingredients.  I on the other hand (as the cook/mom/wife) thought it was a great, quick meal that filled everyone up and using low fat ingredients wasn't all that bad for you"
1803684521,100270,2016-01-11,4,"Despite the fact that my parfaits didn&#039;t layer well and it all ended up mixed together, it tasted pretty good! I think my cherries weren&#039;t drained well enough, as I was able make a thick sauce with the juice and cornstarch but once I added all the cherries it went completely runny again. Nice flavour combination though!"
2001114581,11763,2016-08-04,5,"This one is a winner. To add to the chorus, I doubled the amount of lemon in the cake and added the zest of one lemon. Moist, not too heavy, delish with some strawberries from the farmers market and whipped cream."
602763,170604,2009-03-01,5,So much more interesting than the plain steamed rice that I seem to (over)use with Asian dishes. Thank you!
369264,169034,2008-02-12,3,This was only okay for me.  I'd probably cook the sweet potato in some olive oil and seasonings next time because they just seemed to be lacking a strong flavor on their own.  I'll experiment a bit more next time!
131674,239902,2007-08-26,5,"I was also a little ""chicken"" about the ceviche but this turned out great!  Perfect with our drinks.  Loved the mint flavor."
2000406539,160202,2015-10-18,1,"I followed this recipe as instructed, but it did not have much flavor, too bland. I regret I did not add garlic, and other herbs and spices."
397545,325137,2010-12-04,5,"I normally don't review recipes, but this one was too good not to! I'm a big fan of using whole wheat flour. This bread not only tastes delicious, it is moist and raises well! When zucchini is in season (hence coming out of our ears!), I like to grate it and freeze it in 2 cup portions ready for this recipe! The best (and healthiest!) zucchini bread recipe I've found by far! THANK YOU!"
805131,77397,2011-03-19,0,Delicious and easy to make! Kept one and sent the other off to a bake sale. Thanks!
82367,22108,2003-11-11,4,"I actually made this without the ham for a side dish. I sometimes make scalloped potatoes using 1-2 cans cream of chicken soup and a little milk, but I pre-cook the potatoes & onions in a large frying pan in about 2 cups of water first for about 10 minutes first before layering in my casserole, then they only need about 30-45 mins. in the oven. I did not do that this time as I just didn't feel like dirtying another large dish, so I cooked these according to the recipe,except I covered with foil and removed for the last 1/2 hr. which I thought was probably good as they browned and crisped up a fair bit after this so I wonder if they would have been too browned on top for my liking without the foil for the entire time. I cooked for the time stated and once I served them up, the odd one throughout that was cut a little thicker, could have used an extra few minutes, but I certainly did not have any major problems with these not being cooked well. I really enjoyed the addition of the thyme as I like the flavour of it.I sprinkled a little extra on top along with a little parsley for colour. We enjoyed as a side dish and I would like to try again with the ham,I bet the flavours complement well!"
302094,59410,2007-03-20,5,"I almost posted this recipe the only difference is it calls for 3 Tbls. green onion sliced thin. This is so good, and so easy to make. I had to cook my noodles and vegetables for 10 min. I will be making this often. Thanks for posting Fluffy!"
37449,62356,2003-06-09,5,"My family enjoyed this dish Rhonda! I made it just as directed, except I used bone-in chicken. Thanks!"

247780,61278,2006-04-11,5,"Let me say this...I'm an american living in England...so ANY English cooking I attempt is highly scrutinized.  This was so easy and cheap to make! Just some lemon, sugar, and eggs!  Everyone LOVED it! Just LOVED it! And it had a great consistancy and just tart enough to go with some homeade cranberry scones and clotted cream. Try this one!!"
2002162663,525633,2018-05-24,4,"Used 2 T pur&eacute;ed chipotle in adobe sauce instead of chili sace (what I had), and chili oil.

145880,51550,2008-02-21,5,"This is without a doubt the very best cornbread I have ever made, and I've made lots of cornbread.  It is fantastic with bean soup, pinto beans, or buttered for a snack.  Perfection!"
424680,383271,2009-08-31,5,"Don't know if I changed the taste or texture of this cornbread, but I used a reduced-fat buttermilk as well as a no-sodium salt, but other than that the recipe was followed (well, I was generous with the half cup of corn!) & we had A GREAT TASTING CORNBREAD! Certainly a recipe I want to keep around ~ Thanks for sharing it! [Tagged, made & reviewed in Newest Zaar recipe tag]"
225903,85413,2005-12-19,5,"I've made this twice now but didn't review it the first time because I goofed and left the melted butter in the microwave until abut 15 minutes into the baking time. I belatedly mixed it in, but then wasn't sure how much longer to cook it. It was yummy, but the consistency was a little weird. The second time I came perilously close to forgetting the butter again. It might be helpful if in step 5 you listed the remaining ingredients.  I only made one pie each time, using 2  1/4 cups of brown sugar since I had a large bag of brown sugar rather than the conveniently labeled 16 oz box. The Kahlua and chocolate combination is scrumptious and I'll defineitly make this pie again."
226066,249052,2008-03-19,5,Followed Annacia's review... didn't have Vanilla vodka so added a few drops of Vanilla extract... Delicious!!!  Thanks lazyme!
47907,259788,2009-03-30,4,"I used thin boneless pork chops, too, and thought it was just OK.  DH, on the other hand, really enjoyed them.  I think I would cut down on the olive oil a little bit next time.  Thanks for posting!  Made for PAC Spring 2009."
107081,49597,2008-09-27,5,"We really liked the lentils in this recipe. We added Italian seasoning, grated carrots, squash and left out the last 1/2 cup of water as well. We had enough to freeze to enjoy this a couple more times. Thank you!"
378710,102377,2008-08-27,4,"Very good flavor and used it as a side with a nice beef filet. The flavor complimented the beef in a great way. If you like Balsamic Vinegar (like we do) you must try this recipe. We're a big fan of any kind of roasted vegetables and this recipe was wonderful. What's not to like when you have butter, onions & potatoes. Made for the Aussie/NZ Aug 2008 Recipe Swap."
213139,291881,2009-09-30,5,"This is a great salad dressing recipe ~ nice and savory.  Like one of the other reviewers, I used regular tomato sauce and left out the salt.  I also did not use tarragon vinegar as I didn't want to spend the money for it since I probably wouldn't use it again.  Just used red wine vinegar.  Thanks for posting this Kate.  Made for I Recommend Tag."
630439,25348,2008-05-11,4,"If you can't find paneer in your grocery store, no worries- it's SUPER easy to make paneer at home.  I found this recipe: http://www.recipezaar.com/139897   (As always, read the reviews to learn more.)  The best part about making paneer at home is you can add your own seasonings while the curds are still hot and fresh.  I like to stir in a little bit of fresh garlic and chopped cilantro myself.  Then bundle it up in a cloth, twist to tighten a bit, set it in a sieve with something heavy on top of it to press it, and leave overnight in the fridge, setting the whole kaboodle over a bowl or tray of course, to catch the drips.  It's so EASY.  Also, the recipe above calls for lemon juice, but any acidic juice will work.  I like lime, myself.  Heather U, I hope you'll give it a try!"
2001769043,14052,2017-10-28,0,The recipe is taken from Filipino Cooking Here &amp; Abroad by Eleanor Laquian and Sobrevinas.What vinegar are we using?What about the soy sauce?low salt or silver swan sodium? Appreciate additional info.
185926,227623,2009-01-12,4,The chicken was good and light.  Although I thought it was a little on the bland and dry side.  But maybe it was because I used boneless and skinless chicken breast.  Thank you.
1700496,76864,2011-06-10,5,"These cinamon rolls were great! I also had a problem with the rolls in the center being under cooked and the rolls on the outside being overcooked and dried out, so i changed the pan size, instead of using one 9x13 pan, I used two 8"" round cake pans, i put 6 in each pan lined them up around the outside of the pan (do not put any in the middle). turned out perfect, they all were moist and cooked evenly."
2239099,153542,2016-07-17,5,"Thank you for the recipe!! I love soup and/or one pot meals. As written, the soup is pretty good. A little bland for my personal taste but once I doctored it with garlic powder, fresh cracked pepper and finished it with some Chalula... it was super fantastic!! I'll definitely make again but will prepare meat with fresh garlic in addition to the garlic powder and Chalula"
248023,95068,2006-02-17,5,"Very yummy indeed!  My BF and I are not on low carb diets, but I decided to 'sneak' this dish in one night.  He could not believe that it was cauliflower.  I also loved it, and I have never been a fan of this vegetable.  The only changes I made was to add 1-2 Tbs of finely grated romano cheese that I had leftover from the night before. It added so much flavor and richness. I also pureed the cauliflower after zapping it in the microwave... it was almost the exact consistency of mashed potatoes.  You must try it... it will change your mind about cauliflower forever!"
58104,84568,2004-05-25,5,This is very easy and very good. The mushrooms were cooked to prefection in the time the cheese melted and turned a golden brown as you see in the picture. A great quick appetizer!
139381,58738,2012-05-16,5,"I baked some chicken breasts today to freeze for future use. I remembered that I had filed this recipe yesterday in my cookbook for Condiments & Sauces.  Whipped it up in a flash today and added diced chickden.  Rolled it in a tortilla. This made a VERY quick lunch, and it's VERY tasty.  I'm going to make up a batch of this to freeze in ice trays, then store in the freezer.  You can't beat this for ease and taste....not to mention versatility.  Thanks!"
2043132,453365,2012-03-03,5,"Absolutely delicious!<br/>Perfect blend of seasonings in this bread<br/>I ate too much of it because it was so good.<br/>Crusty outside, soft inside<br/><br/>Note: I only baked it for 35 minutes; I also used 2.5 cups bread flour"
95743,45483,2003-11-29,5,"Perfect!  Your Dh is right, this is a keeper.  My dressing is made of all the same ingredients but I never measure and it turns out differently every time.  I think your ingredient proportions are just right and I'm delighted to never have to guess again. The only change I made was to use homemade turkey stock. Your stuffing is absolutely delicious-can't wait for lunch tomorrow.  Who am I kidding?  I'll be eating it at breakfast.  I love bread stuffing-turkey's just the carrier. Thank you so much, Debbb!"
278113,83561,2006-07-30,5,"YUM!!All of us (including both children) loved this recipe! I used boneless chicken tenders, and cooked them for 25 mins. They were so moist and delicious! This is going to be a regular here for us from now on..thanks for sharing this great recipe!!"
280149,147288,2006-01-03,3,"Great taste, but difficult to fry.  I was wondering if some binder like egg would have helped hold the potato cake together better."
350812,494737,2016-10-09,3,"This is a very nice, average kugel. I used goat cheese, and upped the za'atar to 3/4t. The tastes all blend together nicely, but I was looking for something where I could taste, or at least detect, the za'atar and I got none of that in this recipe. I'll likely make it again, but will increase the za'atar to at least 1t, if not 1 1/2. Issues with the recipe as written though....no cooking temp is specified!! I cooked mine at 350 and that worked just fine. Also, if I know I want to double the recipe, this doesn't specify the size bag of noodles I'd need...12oz or 16 oz."
480195,500409,2013-09-06,5,We really enjoyed these eggs for breakfast. I will be making them again soon. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
283390,124180,2006-10-04,4,"This was a very yummy dessert, and it couldn't be any easier to put together. The next time I make it, I will toast the coconut first or add coconut extract rather than almond (what can I say...I really love the taste of coconut). Thanks for sharing a quick and delicious recipe!"
2114468,173076,2011-12-21,0,such good bacon
101823,64708,2005-03-05,5,"Wonderful asparagus recipe.  Instead of boiling my asparagus, I steamed it until tender/crisp before sautÃ©ing it in the butter.  The Parmesan cheese and lemon juice were the perfect finish for the dish.  Thanks for posting."
537179,64468,2007-09-24,5,Absolutely delicious! I omited the walnuts just because I didnt have any on hand. This is a great idea for the surplus canteloupe puree I have on hand. My garden produced way to much. I'm happy now that I have a use for it. This will be nice in mini loaves for my christmas baskets this year. Thank you for sharing your wondeful recipe with us.
60231,161751,2006-04-01,5,"I got this magazine and made this almost right away. (You beat me to it as far as posting it!)We really enjoyed it and I did make it as listed although I substituted green pepper for the red.
We really enjoyed it.

"
578015,77184,2007-09-20,4,"This was quick and easy and my family liked it. I did add 1 clove of minced fresh garlic as well as some fresh parsley. I also added more onion. I did not have beef bouillon so I used beef broth. I will make this again, but use rice instead of noodles. Thank you for the recipe."
1058097,389644,2010-04-19,5,"The cream cheese makes this a really tasty, gooey sandwich.  I didn't put the mayo in the middle.  My Swiss cheese took a while to melt, so I did have to watch carefully to prevent scorching.  Thanks for posting! Made for Spring 2010 PAC."
540117,59900,2007-08-29,5,This really is one of the best banana bread recipes. The bread is moist and sweet. Everyone in my house loved it! I gave away the 2nd loaf and it was devoured the same day. Thanks for the great recipe!
2000341224,38298,2015-07-15,5,"I used to order this soup at Olive Garden every time I would go... no need for the extra trip (and $$) now!! This recipe is AMAZING, tastes exactly like my favorite zuppa toscana! Note: if you like yours a bit spicier, use a spicy italian sausage. Adds a bit of a kick, but not too much in contrast to the super creamy soup base. Also, I have tried this recipe with both kale and swiss chard, I like the texture of swiss chard a bit more."
1239906,114852,2009-07-20,2,"We weren't very impressed, the cigars came out very dry and the flavor wasn't anything special."
1119401,3603,2009-01-09,5,My husband has always said he only goes to Hooters for the Hot Wings. I made a batch of these last night and he said they are as good as the ones he gets at Hooters so I guess he will have to come up with another excuse to go to Hooters. These are great. I can't take the heat so I made half as in the recipe and the other half I used less hot sauce and a little bar-b-que sauce.
75442,53878,2008-06-27,5,Have made these a few times now and everybody loves them.
1354092,70207,2010-07-16,5,Excellent recipe.  I omitted the salt and used red onions instead and turned out great!  Can't wait to use this recipe again.  Thanks!
47907,85341,2007-07-05,5,I made this for our barbecue for the 4th and it was huge hit!  I doubled the recipe and it came out great.  I made as posted using sweet pickle relish and cherry tomatoes and a cucumber from my garden.  It was easy to put together.  Thanks so much for posting!
399474,255171,2008-10-18,5,These were very tasty! I will be making them for Thanksgiving! We didn't put walnuts in them just personal tastes. But my husband really loved! I also didn't use the seperate spices but used pumpkin pie spice instead. Very simple to make though and they were a huge hit! Loved and will make again for sure! Made for FALL PAC 2008
1508712,148440,2011-10-15,5,"This was exactly what I was looking for... Made a few adjustments...no meat, used a Ham soup base, more onions, black pepper, more tomatoes... (you know how we all ""doctor"" stuff up!!! ) Excellent...thanks so much for posting this...."
1326908,313788,2015-06-20,5,"I just made this today, however I used my last years canned tomatoes, so I knew ahead of time that my sauce would be runny, so I added 24 oz of tomato paste and a little white pepper (personal taste). I canned this batch,  I did 45min water bath.  It smells great, it&#039;s thick, I will make this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing.  I&#039;m always looking for recipes to use up my last years tomatoes."
15205,8701,2003-02-13,5,This recipe was very helpful to me and my children! Especially with their math homework.
88099,135619,2008-04-27,5,Wonderful french bread.  Texture is perfect.  Loved the addition of the roasted garlic.  Thanks
718620,354499,2010-02-12,5,so yummy...i love baked oatmeal - post more  :-)
382203,114575,2011-02-12,5,"This was fabulous!  I made it for a dinner last night and it got rave reviews.  I did not add the coconut or nuts and I made a different topping.  I mixed cheese cheese, sugar, whipped cream and crushed pineapple together and used that as a topping. Thanks for a great Recipe"
80353,120212,2006-04-19,5,Such a lovely recipe and perfect for this week of Fasting.  I mashed my potatoes with olive oil for that reason (to keep things OK for the Lenten Fast).  The olive oil makes a kind of sauce with the garlic and parsley over the mound of fish and potato.  Very home-comforting and addictive.
1435976,200296,2009-11-03,5,"I tried this recipe with a few small modifications. I used Hidden Valley Spicy Ranch and with a lot more pepper, Matt and I like our food spicy. I also coated some Steak fries with this mix and baked them with the chicken... It was excellent!"
572998,157354,2009-01-21,5,"I really enjoyed this recipe. I love citrus, so the lime really made this dish for me. Substituted rice for the beans and it worked out great."
1802911328,120470,2014-07-09,0,"Great recipe! Easy, nutritious and delicious. I added a small amount of mini penne pasta, cooked and small amount of uncooked broccoli."
650758,33671,2008-09-28,5,"OMG! This Is so good, and you are right about falling off the bone. I did make just a few adjustments. I used 2tsp of salt and 2 tsp of season salt. Also I didn't have cayenne so i use red pepper and didn't have white pepper so i just omitted all together. I added 1 tsp of lemon pepper also. I didn't chop the onion i just shoved a whole onion up the cavity. I rubbed the spices all over the chicken and under the skin, i did not let it refrigerate overnight it still came out perfect. I also took the advice of another reviewer and put it in my oven on broil and cooked for about 6 mins to get that nice crispy skin. Yummo!!! Thanks for posting i will be passing this along to everyone I know!!!!!!!!"
68960,171633,2007-02-05,4,This is exactally Mum's old recipe and one that both my grandmother made. Out of the good old Edmonds cookbook. Thanks for posting Sharon!
248179,39369,2007-11-15,5,"I was a little leery at first since this didn't call for an actual roux, and even though it turned out excellent, next time I will make a roux on the side...  Of course, I had to add 1/2 an onion and a clove of garlic, used 1/2 Smart Balance and 1/2 olive oil,whole wheat flour, and some salt and pepper...  Had to add a bit more flour to get the right consistency...  It was perfect in a mug on a cold day, walking to the nearest pub for a winter ale!!!  Thanks!!!"
105352,223139,2007-07-28,5,"Wow! This pizza was delicious. DH had been to an Italian restaurant that served pizza with ricotta, spinach and tomatoes and asked me to find a recipe. He said this was better than the restaurant pizza.
I used more garlic and put the pizza back in to oven for a minute to heat the sliced tomato. It was wonderful!"
657246,338012,2009-12-31,5,"Very easy to make and yummy, too.  I like to make a couple of batches to freeze so we can just pull them out for a quick lunch.  Also, the dough has become our standard pizza crust dough.  For the last 11 years, we have made pizza from scratch on Friday nights, and have experimented with numerous pizza doughs over the years.  This dough by far is the easiest to  make, to work with, and does not compete with the toppings when used as a pizza dough."
111811,42380,2003-11-24,4,"Yum,I sprinkled the steaks with BBQ spice before I beat them"
542848,111467,2010-06-29,5,"I've never made a meatloaf that had my mouth watering before I even put it in the oven!  This was really tasty and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I will definitely make this again, often."
452940,276140,2008-01-07,4,We made this using wings and skinless leg quarters. We enjoyed the nice mellow flavor of this dish. Thanks for sharing.
85414,13961,2003-12-27,4,"The brining was great for a moist turkey. Mine came out tasting rather salty, though. I notice that most other brining recipes only call for one cup of salt, so next time I'll just cut the salt in half. "
1684045,205878,2011-03-02,5,"This is great! However, are you sure it makes 8 cups? I feel like it makes a lot more."
482376,383741,2011-06-09,4,"We really enjoyed this chicken recipe. The coconut milk, mango and tomato work very well together. I served this over rice, which worked well with the sauce. Thank you! Made during the ZWT 7 for the Golden Gourmets."
1802811332,403520,2015-08-02,4,"I used actually bacon that I cooked and diced instead if bacon bits, also substituted milk for table cream and cooked it on low for 8 hours. It&#039;s an amazing recipient that my whole family loves!!!"
350812,80413,2010-06-09,5,"These were easy & AWESOME!  Per another review, instead of 3.75C bread flour, I used 1.5C whole wheat flour, 1.5C bread flour, and .75C regular oats.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
2001206433,440749,2016-10-14,5,"I just made this! For myself and my partner and we loved it, very tasty dish and very filling! First time making a homemade soup too. Will definitely be making it again"
21752,198344,2006-12-13,5,"Sometimes I misread a recipe and really mess it up.  Sometimes it comes out wonderfully.  This was one of those times.  Canned tomatoes, the recipe calls for canned WHOLE tomatoes!  I used a can of CRUSHED tomatoes.  I couldn't understand how in the directions is says to remove the tomatoes from the liquid, the whole thing is just one big slushy mess!  So I just poured the whole thing into the pot and continued merrily along with the recipe.  Luckily for me this cooked up beautifully!  I used 2 minced cloves of garlic instead of the garlic powder, and added a dash of za'atar to the mix as well.  Stuff was super yummy!  We had it with eggs and m'llawach for a light supper.  Good stuff!"
130405,84624,2004-03-08,5,This soup is great! It tastes so great like it's all made from scratch. Someone made this for me when I was recovering at home from the birth of my child and it was just the right thing!
156653,98127,2004-10-04,4,"Good, but a bit too sweet. I have made it twice now (I LOVE cookie dough!) and the second time I added only half the sugar, and it was much better in my opinion!! I thank you for making my ""raw dough"" days into ""safe raw dough"" days!! haha"
187373,224943,2013-02-07,4,"Love that this is full of vegetables.  Unfortunately my toddler son won't eat it, but DH and I liked it.  Got distracted by said son and forgot to add the salt and pepper.  Had to add more spices, added another can of tomatoes and a full 15 oz can of tomato sauce.  Also had to puree it up so DH wouldn't know about the veggies ;)   Made for Zaar Cookbook Tag."
153878,102504,2004-10-25,5,Very good. We used 1.5 lbs lean hamburger to cut down on fat and only added the onion & garlic after the meat was browned and drained. Also used a 6 oz can tomato paste and it had plenty of tomato flavor. Thanks.
219942,51643,2005-09-19,5,"Mmmmmm! Picky daughter was first to the table and was giving me the thumbs up before her Dad and I made it to the table! Now THAT'S a great review! I didn't butterfly the breasts, just pounded them to 1/2"" thickness. We did think it needed a bit more salt. Daughter said, ""Put the knife away, Mom, this doesn't need it, it's soooo  tender!"" Very tender and very moist. Great recipe, definitely a keeper. Thanks!"
64322,185106,2007-07-04,5,I chose this for a community picnic because it was different and not something creamy.  I really liked it.  It disappeared but I don't know what others thought of it.  I will definitely take it to other gatherings.  I did use regualar cucumbers and I drained a bit of the liquid before going to the picnic.
1015482,15875,2009-02-23,5,"Delicious and spicy, just the way I like it. I followed the recipe for the most part except I used less butter and skim milk. I did end up having to add more flour as a result however."
2147655,8899,2012-01-15,5,"The recipe is fantastic...a hit at every party I bring it to. I use tuna, shrimp and bay scallops. I do par boil the shrimp and bay scallops. I use bay scallops because they are the perfect size without cutting them. I omit the oregano. Green bell pepper is too strong for me so I use yellow bell which also adds a beautiful color against the green cilantro and red tomato. Also use red onion."
513366,186059,2008-08-18,5,I made this in foil on the grill and they were YUM-O.  I used fresh motz and fresh basil.. and it was delicious!!  I will be making these again and again!!
737593,244238,2012-08-11,5,Thank you so much my husband loves this!
283788,161371,2006-03-02,5,"Mojitos are the best, and this is delicious.Flavors blend beautifully.  A tasty treat."
624212,38693,2010-08-05,5,"Very tasty!  Followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great - works well over basmati rice."
2002134636,89164,2018-04-29,5,"this recipe is not only easy, but the bread it made is really good. I would like to make whole wheat bread and some rye bread....do you have anything similarly easy. I guess the ingredients and amounts would change?"
203111,273710,2009-11-06,5,"This may possibly be the best recipe on Zaar, IMO.  I absolutely LOVE these chocolatey little melt-in-your-mouth morsels and I'm not really much of a cookie lover.   I've made them three times now, halving the recipe the first 2 times.  They are so quick and easy and call for ingredients I always have on hand.  I guess the only drawback is the fact that they aren't very pretty.  I dip mine in the cocoa/powdered sugar mix twice because if I dip them only once, the oil seeps through and makes them splotchy looking.     Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!!!!"
60992,166343,2009-04-19,4,"This was good, just not spectacular. I felt like something was missing and couldn't quite put my finger on it. I added the optional sauteed red pepper and used sharp cheddar. I think they were tastier warm rather than at room temperature. I will try them again maybe with some herbs in it, see if that htis the spot. It is a fantastic use of leftover ham."
167412,314384,2008-11-25,5,Loved this as a kid and was so excited to find it again!  My kids are loving it now!  Fast and easy to make for snacking.
50969,291170,2008-07-23,4,"I made this gravy on 7/22/08 for mine and my SO's dinner. He's doing the low-carb thing and I'm not, so I've been trying to find recipes that we both enjoy. And I have to tell you we BOTH enjoyed thise recipe very much.I know the title says it should be used for chicken fried steak, but I fried up a couple of boneless skinless chicken breasts and the gravy went perfectly with them.I cut the recipe in half so neither one of us would be tempted to eat more than we should. I used just a little less than a 1/2 Tablespoon of the powdered chicken bouillon.After frying the chicken, I made the gravy in the same pan, so I could get the ""yummy"" pieces that were left behind.  And I have to tell you this gravy ""hit the right spot"" as far as being a very good ""comfort food"" This will be made again. Thank you for posting and, ""Keep Smiling :)"""
67067,105207,2005-11-29,5,I tried this truffle to add variety to the candy tray I am planning to carry to my grandkids school for the teachers and staff one day next week.  I used the Malibu rum and they came out so nice. Not too much alcohol flavor.  I dyed some of the coconut with red and green food coloring to and they looked very attractive on my plate.
173085,8579,2011-01-20,5,This was wonderful!  Thank you so much for the recipe!  I made exactly as directed - next time I may put a little less onion soup mix to cut down on the salt flavour.  Our definite go-to recipe for beef!
843372,103406,2009-01-17,5,"I prepared this using butternut squash.  I did the browned butter, honey and sage variation with great results.  It was so good with our dinner.  This will be enjoyed by us many times.  Thanks!"
107583,219707,2007-06-15,5,"Very tasty!  I used Splenda, lemon mint and spearmint, and I think I would use more mint and less Splenda next time.  Much lighter tasting than commercial limeade.  Thanks for a new summertime drink!"
58229,29679,2004-11-24,5,OMG these rocked. super easy and quick to make.  they are very rich but oh so good.  my husband took them to work and everyone loved them.  thanks for the awesome recipe.
354413,14858,2008-04-12,5,These cookies have a great flavor and love that they are dropped and not formed into balls.  I used them to make Banana Pudding.  No one knew that the wafers were made from scratch.  Thanks Mirj!
286566,469632,2012-01-17,5,"I scaled this back for 3 eggs and it was the perfect amount for 2 wholegrain muffins.  I served mine with some extra salad on the side for what was a delicious lunch.  Thank you Hanka, made for Make My Recipe - New Year Edition."
555701,301796,2008-05-29,5,"This is without a doubt the most sensual recipe I have ever made!  Perfect delight for the senses!  Picking the roses under a warm spring sun with the scent all around you and bees buzzing in and out . . . then the visual delight of all of the roses, the silken feel while plucking the petals off, then cooking it down, it perfumed the whole house, then in the jars and the little ""schnick"" when they sealed - music to my ears!    Tastes like angel kisses!!  Thank you FT!!"
1057090,22782,2008-12-03,5,"ok heres the story. i was talking to this girl and i was cooking some food at the same time. she pulled the whole ""i didn't know guys could cook"" thing. so i took it as a challenge and asked her what her favorite food was. it was (guess what!) spaghetti. i panicked at first because i have never made spaghetti before, but i started looking over some recipes and felt a bit more confident. i decided upon this one because it was so highly reviewed so many times and i felt like i could trust it. and WOW i could. it came out wonderfully. i substituted the sausage with 2lb. of meatballs, which i also made from scratch and other than that followed the recipe pretty closely. instead of simmering it, i put it in the crockpot for a total of about 7 hours and it came out wonderfully. because of this i did not add any water. instead of red pepper i tried my luck with some chili powder, and it worked surprisingly well. i also threw in some parmesan cheese to the sauce. wonderful recipe, thanks for posting it! =] the girl named it the best spaghetti she had ever tasted."
1023526,38298,2018-08-06,5,Super good!
621626,227795,2009-01-14,5,I made this using potatoes & olives as my vegetables. I did add 1 beef bouillon cube & a tbsp of tomato paste to the sauce. DH enjoyed it very much.
60989,2886,2007-04-09,5,"Very good bread. Nice and dense, the way we like it. Thanks!"
140132,45991,2010-01-19,4,"Great tuna salad.  I really liked the bite....we love horseradish on everything, just never thought of adding it to our tuna salad.  Thank you so much for sharing."
2000396299,173263,2015-08-10,5,"I made this with chopped, unpeeled peaches. Also added a cinnamon stick. This was absolutely delicious. Only got better as it sat in the fridge and the favors melded. Thanks!"
1528243,184288,2013-08-07,5,This is a really good recipe.  I took some suggestions and added 1/2 tablespoon of Baking Powder to the dry ingredients and added an extra egg.  Very happy with the results.  Thank you Kennilyn!
232893,100380,2005-08-01,5,"This is absolutely AWESOME!  I used peach-mango salsa, and eliminated the cilantro.  I also used brown rice.  Try marinating/grilling the chicken with Caribbean Jerk marinade.  YUM!!"
451287,246602,2009-07-04,5,"AMAZING!!!  These were so easy to make, and they were quite the hit of the party!  Great recipe  :)"
637887,235272,2012-04-28,5,"It doesn't get much better than this! Yummmmy!! The breading stays put....hard to find in other recipes. Been in my cookbook for a long time, just now I finally remembered to rate and review. lol."
674484,112936,2008-05-15,5,"I love olives, so this was a must for me to try.  It was so good!  I had it on whole wheat Ritz crackers for snack.  Much appreciated! Elaine"
197023,233210,2008-12-11,5,"I don't care for ginger but my mother loves it, so I made this for her - exactly to the recipe.  She really enjoyed a glass of this shake for this morning's breakfast and is pleased that she has another serve to enjoy tomorrow morning.  She loved the blend of flavours and wouldn't even mind a bit more ginger in it!  So, Julie, I'll certainly be making this again.  Next time, I'm going to try making it with Greek yoghurt instead of the buttermilk. Thank you for sharing this recipe!  Made for PRMR."
440324,406935,2013-03-24,4,This was great. The only thing I would change is to add some garlic. Thank you.
107651,113600,2005-03-19,5,"I was the lucky person who was served this delicious recipe at my birthday luncheon. The lamb chops were succulent, the sauce was delicious! Toolie, thank you for sharing another of your very simple and tasty recipes."
53932,65567,2007-06-22,4,I loved the basting sauce.  I used fresh dill and added a little salt and pepper.   Very nice way to prepare haddock.
581862,401510,2010-04-20,5,This is a great burger.  Really moist.  Make sure you cut the celery really thin.  The burgers are great on there own.
1303006,309467,2009-06-21,5,This was a great recipe. I added sweet yellow peppers also because I needed to use it up. This was delicious.
262035,61868,2010-05-28,5,"Yuuuuuuum! I threw this together tonight and it is so fantastic! I broiled the eggplant in the oven, put the arugula, mozzarella, eggplant and some simple garlic mayo (mayo with minced garlic and thyme mixed in) on a crusty bun, threw it back in the oven for a few minutes and chowed down on 3 of them! Not exactly the same as the recipe but holy cow to these flavors go together perfectly. I'm looking forward to eating this all week :)"
1417495,353090,2009-11-18,4,I made this in a regular 8x8 brownie pan and it came out perfectly after only 40 minutes. Its very good. :)
493088,36806,2007-07-30,5,"VERY good. I followed the recipe exactly. GREAT flavor, and great texture. We used this under strawberries for strawberry shortcake. Whenever I need a pound cake I will use this recipe. Fantastic!"
526666,401827,2010-06-18,5,"YUMMY! So good, and it's not bad for you! YAY! I really loved the infused honey; it had great flavor. I may try a touch of vanilla next time, and there will be a next time! Deceptively simple for the flavor found, no one would believe how easy it is! Thanks for sharing, Scoutie! Made for ZWT."
646350,53939,2009-05-28,5,"I tried this for Memorial Day and it was absalutely 
SUPER!!!!!!!!!

    Thank You so much

620763,43891,2009-11-24,5,"This is a delicious, rich, chocolatey frosting! Quick and easy to make. I made it for brownies, but it would be great on chocolate cake or cupcakes."
2002001836,69708,2018-02-20,5,Just made it a 2nd time using half ground pork and thought it was delicious. Definitely my go to recipe. Thanks! Cobined with some cauliflower mash is a great low carb meal.
1113230,407261,2010-02-01,0,These are awesome!  They are even good without the dipping sauce!!
780172,188793,2009-11-19,4,"Simple, easy and just plain good. This was a nice Michigan Dutch recipe, reminded me of my grandma's recipe."
328000,99155,2007-03-03,2,"Honestly, this recipe ended up being far too sweet for me to enjoy. I have heard of people eating peanut butter and honey sandwiches, so perhaps my dislike has more to do with my own personal preferences than it has to do with the recipe itself. My brother also ate some and he thought it was pretty good."
28636,339143,2011-01-08,5,"Wonderful!!  I rubbed the chops with the oil and seasonings and let them sit for an hour before grilling on our inside sandwich grill.  They cooked quickly, were tender, and the combination of herbs was delicious.  Thanks Irmgard - DH wants these chops again soon."
78351,11217,2006-09-29,5,"Just finished making a 2nd batch of this. My first one I added the full amount of sugar and about 3 hot peppers and it had a ""mild"" feel to it. The second batch I added 1/2 cup of sugar (hubby suggested it) and about 6 hot peppers and it was closer to ""hot"". 
This is definitely a keeper, what a wonderful way of utilizing those zucchinis, I swore I wouldn't grow them again, but after this I'm going to just for the salsa!!"
107583,420569,2012-04-20,3,"Sorry, this just didn't work for us.  It sounded good, but we found it too watery and bland.  I followed the instructions and pressed out as much water as I could, but it still ended up very watery.  The ricotta layer needed an egg to bind it, and some herbs, like basil or oregano.  I cut the recipe in half and baked in a 9-inch square pan with no problem.  Made for Spring Pick a Chef game."
493002,42094,2009-04-07,5,This was simple & fast. I addad a few more spices at the end like onion powder & garlic salt.
621626,110899,2008-06-20,5,"Very easy to make & very delicious. My extremely picky daughter went back for thirds. We did leave out the  chilies & used cut up chicken breasts, served over white rice. Thanks"
28339,32439,2004-11-30,5,Made these a an appetizer for thanksgiving and they were a big hit .Everyone wanted the recipe  Thank You!!!
181471,102655,2006-09-19,5,"A classic, my little daughter loves these. So simple you can get the kids to help."
2001765491,69173,2017-11-27,5,SO GOOD. Loaded these meatballs up with parmesan cheese. My boyfriend and I enjoyed them over a bottle of red wine. Perfect!
28177,306197,2010-05-21,5,"This made a quick and fabulous lunch before DH went off to work!  Super easy & quick cooking.  I loved the color and the varied veggies.  DH wasn't crazy about the sauce, but that's not a big deal.  DD (3) & I loved it!  Served this with recipe #423896 for a fast and filling meal.  Thanks for posting, Brenda!  Made & enjoyed for ZWT6 Team Xtra Hot Dishes!"
104600,102330,2007-09-10,5,"My goodness...  I've made this twice and just realized I didn't post a review...  so sorry Hey Jude..  Needless to say, it was one of the best desserts I've made in a long time.  The Keebler Cookies made an outstanding crust and I'm planning on using them for other pies.  I had to print out 6 copies of the recipe for friends and relatives that were visiting from Tennessee.  I did use the green food coloring...   It added visually.  And no doubt, the photo certainly influenced me into trying this recipe.  A wonderful recipe.  Thanks for posting it."
326039,98035,2009-08-25,5,"I think you are right about this being a Midwest thing.  My Grandmother and Mother made this for us as kids growing up.  Every summer when the green beans came on and the new potatoes were ready to be dug, we'd have a big pot of this.  I saute my smoked sausage to brown it good, then throw the onion in to sweat.  If using fresh green beans, you need to trim and snap them into inch long pieces and add enough water to come up about halfway to the beans.  They'll release moisture as they cook down.  Mom and Grandma always added beef bouillon (I use beef base) for seasoning.  Add some freshly ground black pepper and maybe some sprigs of time.  Add your potatoes about 20-30 minutes before you're ready to eat so they can get tender.  We always serve this with Worcestershire sauce on the side so you can sprinkle this over your green beans and taters.  That puts this over the top!  And if you are using commercially canned green beans, just add the liquid from the beans.  No need to drain.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful meal Amanda!"
620763,76645,2008-01-10,3,"I really liked the tangy sauce, but it did not thicken on the chicken. I had to pour the sauce into a saucepan and cook it until it reduced to a thick glaze. Then I spooned the sauce over the chicken. Served with rice."
1328942,1236,2009-09-24,4,I made this for my SO and he said it was different. Not good or bad. In the end he didn't eat the bacon.
593927,359835,2009-05-24,5,"Really tasty. DH liked it. Toddler loves it. I'm liking it a lot more than the canned tomato sauce I'm feeling allergic to (mold allergy, yes mold is in canned tomatoes). Like the recipe poster, I found I had to add more spice than with tomato sauce but I didnt have to add any sugar! Thats a big bonus. Maybe my carrots were big or this is not really red sauce with the small beet added. I cooked a second beet and through in the red juice and discarded the actual beet as I needed additional liquid anyway. It was still a dark orange after. Anyway the colour doesnt matter so much when it tastes really good and is not allergenic. We use a lot of sauce as DH likes sauces with rice dishes and we dont do dairy (yogurt) so I think I will be making this many times instead of using canned tomato sauce anymore!"
1803550230,316825,2014-12-23,1,What a waste of ingredients.  This was the worst cookie I ever made and I have been making cookies for 50 years.  Absolute joke to post this recipe.  All that money for cookies I can&#039;t hand out to anyone.
254614,27157,2008-06-07,5,"Absolutely phenomenal taste!!
I have eaten this almost all of my remembered life but my Dad cooked the recipe and when he passed, the recipe was gone. Mom and I made it but it wasn't the same. This recipe is the same!! I can't thank you enough for posting this!"
27416,89751,2005-02-03,5,"KITTENCAL;
What a recipe, the cupcakes turned out super great.  So moist and tender.  I made one bit of a change, using 1 cup of all-purpose flour and 1 cup of cake and pastry flour.  This made them Oh So Good.
Can't say that they would not have been as good following your recipe.  But thought I would give it a try.
I will be making 300 of the cupcakes, but will make them mini size, so that I will get about 48 out of the recipe.
This is for a function on Sunday, February 6, 2005 and we are expecting about 250 persons.

I have not iced them yet, will leave that to the day before.
Thank you so much for this fabulous recipe.
""Uncle Bill"""
891815,172417,2008-07-14,5,These were great. I added cranberries instead of apricots and used a bit of cinnamon (I love cinnamon!).
66247,276903,2008-01-11,5,This was SO good! It's one I would definitely make again. I made sweet potato fries and a tomato salad to go with the roast - it was a delicious meal.
591307,39087,2008-04-02,5,I was looking for something good for dinner the other night and decided to make this.  My DH and I thank you.  It was delicious and one we will be making again real soon!
2000285999,342026,2015-10-08,0,made this dip for ladies night out at our local vfw and everyone loved it.  Great recipe.
213699,94133,2005-07-30,5,oh my goodness this was such a wounderful dish the only thing i added was a mango chutney dipping sauce and it was to die for. thanks for the great recipe 
2372432,103215,2012-09-24,5,Thanks for the heads up about the first part of the recipe- just use common sense when dredging and breading your meat. The rest of the recipe is just fine. And the finished product was perfect! Way better than our usual take out. I served this with sugar snap peas and white rice. Couldn't have been a better meal!
1520329,109264,2010-02-04,5,Amazing! These are very good. I have made these for a main course and for an appetizer and they always get high praise. They are also good reheated.
68526,125633,2008-01-28,5,"I loved these! I added 1/2 c. fresh blueberries into the cream cheese mix, and other than that followed the recipe, splitting it in half. They were really yummy along with some hot chocolate! Thank you Paula :) Made for Comfort Food Photos"
233427,208136,2008-04-01,4,"Very good taste, it makes a LOT!  We had plenty for 16 servings."
160977,501180,2013-06-22,5,"It&#039;s asparagus time here and I am glad that this recipe was created. It&#039;s nice and fresh. used soy sauce and fresh basil. Found that one teaspoon sesame oil was enough, otherwise the taste would have been too strong. I halved the recipe, otherwise it would have been too much for us. The leftovers were nice but I would not recommend to save it for more than two days, the asparagus gets too wilted. Thanks for creating and posting. Made for Raiders of the Lost Pantry Contest."
477411,32206,2007-09-09,4,"We really loved this preparation. We thought the snapper was a little too delicious without it thou. Will try something a little more bland next time like a Cod or Halibut. We also Paired it with a herb aioli which our fish market in Santa Barbara Makes. Lots of fresh herbs. lime and Mayo and the pairing was amazing. I didn't  put it in the oven, just let it simmer on the stove top for about 10-15 minutes as it gets too hot in our apartment. Good summer meal. No need to Heat the whole house. Thanks for the Post. :)"
956843,327318,2009-07-07,5,This was delicious. The only thing I am going to do different next time is use balsamic vinegar instead of the cider vinegar. I think it will complement the tomatoes better. Thanks for posting
2001473161,502861,2017-04-05,5,"Love this recipe. Kept ingredients the same, but instead of mixing the beans in with the meat, I spread them on the Tortillas. Easy and tasty recipe, and so many ways to make it to your liking."
177435,124364,2005-06-14,4,This was easy to make. It was much better the second day. I took it to a picnic and got a few compliments on it.
43388,59900,2009-06-22,5,"Absolutely phenomenal banana bread! I make it in a Bundt pan, so I omit the topping portion and multiply the rest of the ingredients (including the original poster's recommendation for baking soda as well as the baking powder) by 1.5 and bake it exactly 60 minutes. Comes out perfectly every time! In a pinch, I have also subsituted sour cream for the buttermilk when I did not have it available and that works just as well! :-)"
164113,40104,2004-10-05,5,It was SOOOOO GOOD!!  I wish I can give Bergy more than five stars.  It was easy and delicious.  I used string beans instead of snow peas and it was great.  I will try this with snow peas next time. Thanks Bergy:)
683666,56103,2012-11-03,5,Yum!! These are really delicious and really simple! I think they could've used just a little more lemon pepper but otherwise perfect!!
56001,38432,2002-10-02,5,Terrific.  They are really easy to make and tasted great.  I'll be making this recipe again!
183098,22210,2006-05-09,5,"Miller, rest your soul, these are great!  Unlike some other reviewers, I did not have any trouble keeping them together.  I used Heinz chili sauce, which is very thick -- so I think that helps.  I followed the instructions exactly, and added 2 chopped green onions.  These are the best burgers ever!  I made small ""slider"" size cheeseburgers.  They did not have to cook for the entire 10 minutes due to their small size.  By all means try these!  You will not be disappointed!
--Marla"
104295,275041,2010-02-03,5,"We loved this as dessert after a vegetarian dinner.  My husband thought they were a little too sweet, but the rest of us loved them.  I only used 3 apples because it is what I had and wanted to use up.  I peeled and sliced while the soup was simmering and then left it to cook while we started eating dinner.  Very nice.  Thanks."
128803,20500,2004-11-20,5,"DH is not a pasta lover, like me, but he asked for this one again!  Served this with Cajun chops.  Incredible flavor!"
47559,105241,2005-09-05,5,"Very easy to make and delicious.  Loved the texture of the bread and the buttery taste.  It is one of those recipes you have working in the background over a 24 hour period.  Not a lot of time for each step, though.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  I'll definitely make it again."
1951006,27520,2011-07-07,0,"I've been making this for years.  When I have about 1/2 a pound of hamburger, I mix it with an onion, green pepper, stalk of chopped celery, clove of garlic.  Brown it up, drain, then add a can of beef broth, can of tomatoes, tsp. of worchestershire, about a 1/3 cup of ketchup, salt, pepper, parsley, basil, and oregano.  Boil the mac separately, then add.  Top with cheddar, parmesan, velveeta, whatever you have.  Great meal!"
461834,320601,2009-11-09,5,"Wonderful salad and would be great to make for wedding or baby showers!!!  I made this as written with a few changes.  I made it for 4 salads and used bacon for the ham and used mozzarella cheese and omitted the red onion as  I used my Recipe #228781 dressing, which already had onion in it.  I took it for a dinner at my cousin's house and it was a hit.  Could also see adding garlic or other seasoning to the butter prior to coating the tortillas!!  Thanks for sharing this great salad recipe.  Made for PRMR."
135470,494778,2015-08-20,3,"The sauce has a light whiskey taste which was nice but the whole thing was very buttery and not real caramel tasting. I had some clumping issues even with careful tempering so had to strain the sauce so over all it ended up pretty thin. My DH who love whiskey wasn&#039;t a fan but I liked the flavor, I just need to figure out what to put it on. Made for Culinary Quest 2015"
226863,82102,2008-12-07,5,Very good!  It was very moist and tastey.  I will definitely make this again.
200270,204570,2007-03-01,5,"What a winner...5 stars all the way. I like mine with lots of butter and a smear of vegemite and there is nothing on earth as good as fresh white homemade bread with butter and vegemite. DH loves a lot of vegemite, his favourite though is vegemite, peanut butter and sauce (yuk). All my grandchildren love it my way. A keeper."
2002121167,279095,2018-04-19,0,"I amtrying this out this weekend, but this might interest you all... GOLDEN GAYTIME CRUMBS to rim the glass. Available in Woolies Coles and IGA that I know of....YUM"
173306,248732,2009-09-08,5,"Excellent!  I can't have dairy and this is a great pie crust.  I used the olive oil one time, and melted coconut oil the second (for a sweeter flavor).  I used them for a blueberry pie/crumble.  Thanks for a quick, easy, and delicious recipe!"
416985,53269,2012-03-27,5,This is great!! Every family member loved it (which is rare). I used picante sauce instead of salsa ( just a personal preference).
136997,68317,2010-02-26,5,"Really nice change from regular pasta sides. I used the dried gnocchi found in the pasta isle. As I was uploading the photo, I realised I had forgotten the cheese! Obviously very good even without it. Will remember for next time. :)"
601528,370551,2009-05-25,4,These are very different and very good!  I was a little worried that these would be too sugary sweet for me but they weren't.  The souflee method may have had something to do with it.  I'm not sure what kind of tequila I used but it was brought back on a recent trip to Mexico by a friend of mine and it is good tequila!
125849,99476,2008-03-04,5,"This was really, really good.  And I loved that it didn't require any ""special"" ingredients.  I already had everything in my pantry!  Even my picky 11 year old loved it.  I served it with Trader Joes Organic Jasmine Rice.  Delicious!"
74558,112765,2006-09-11,5,"Fantastic Reets!!!  I doubled the recipe and used red, green, yellow and orange peppers... as well as jalapeno..  Such an easy recipe, so refreshing and great for multi-dipping.  Thanks for a wonderful salsa Rita."
173579,86940,2008-11-27,5,This was a great recipe.  Nice and crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside.  Thanks for posting this recipe.
240552,254941,2007-11-25,5,"YUMMY!  We love cheesecake and this is definitely a great one!  I didn't add the additional nuts so their was a hint of peanut butter taste.  It was really easy, too! I added a little bit of sugar to the pretzels about 1 tsp but would probably add a little more next time and cut down on the crust some to maybe 1/3 cup.  Thanks, Nyteglori!"
230065,102010,2008-04-26,5,"Very tasty!  I get compliments when I bring these for a potluck or use them as a party appetizer.  My husband loves them, so this is a keeper."
1566320,103599,2011-12-17,5,I followed the recipe exactly and the pancakes were perfect.
106506,212460,2008-02-12,5,Covered up the flavor of our slightly strong perch. We liked the firm chew of the feta and olives and the melting texture of the fish together. We used fresh thyme and it was sensational. The feta makes this so definitely use it.
199848,161366,2006-03-09,5,"Great salsa!  It's refreshing with a nice tropical flair.  I used sweet onion and went a little heavier on the cilantro.  I served it over broiled fish, but this would go well w/ chicken and pork, too.  I will make this again.  Thanx for sharing."
1060667,255140,2016-11-21,0,"These are really good, I do miss a &quot;melty cheese&quot; with the mushroom though. I do love feta, was just missing the creaminess in this recipe, a little crunch would have been nice as well."
1183144,107595,2009-11-23,5,"I had these cookies 30 or more years ago at a friend's house and kept trying to get my Mom to make them. The friend's Mom couldn't remember what she had served me, so we had no recipe to go by. I'd describe them with their chewy texture and crunch but my Mom never found the right recipe. Thanks for finding this and sharing it!"
995245,291479,2013-10-09,5,Easy to make. Had chicken on had and tastes great.  Also added about 1 cup frozen peas.  Yum Yum!
2001153100,95086,2016-09-03,5,Just baked a loaf of this. Used my bread machine to make the dough. Very nice recipe. Next time will increase it by 50% and make two smaller loaves for the freezer. :)
198154,116091,2009-10-19,5,Haven't tried the cake yet. But I tasted the frosting and it's excellent.  Will review again after dessert! Looking forward to it.
1056692,431138,2013-03-06,5,"So good!  I did cheat a bit and used really high quality roasted almonds, so I skipped the toasting step out of laziness.  Blended with a grape seed oil, which is fairly neutral and I like the taste, and then I went off the recipe a bit...  Let this blend, having to add about a half a teaspoon more oil to get it the consistency I wanted, then with the processor running I added sugar free chocolate chips and about a tablespoon of sugar free ""honey"" (maltitol syrup) which doesn't taste much like honey but does add a bit of honey flavor when it's in things.  The heat from the mixing melted the chips right in and it all blended up beautifully.  It tastes so good I literally licked it off the spatula like my kids do cake batter!  I can't wait for this to set up to go on low carb toast later.  Thanks for sharing.  I'll try it with agave to cut back on the artificial stuff next time."
568878,128769,2008-04-17,5,"Wow!  I was looking for a variation on the standard sweet meatball recipe -- it seems like everything on here calls for grape jelly & chili sauce or cranberry sauce and chili sauce.  But that was just too sweet for my taste.  Using the apple butter was perfect!  Very sweet -- my 2 year old loves it -- but not disgustingly so that adults run the other direction.  I didn't have any liquid smoke, so I added some worcester sauce instead.  I also added a bit of leftover marinara sauce and used a can of chopped tomatoes instead of fresh ones.  But the meatballs I made from scratch, using ground beef, chopped onion, rice, egg, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  LOVE IT!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe."
782064,10425,2008-10-11,5,"I think this is my favorite new soup! I followed the recipe loosely. I added a little bit of zucchini, left out the celery, used canned pumpkin, and only used about a third of the coconut milk. I also used less stock. It was so rich and flavorful. I served it with spring rolls, which were a great accompaniment. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!"
37449,176608,2006-07-22,5,"Delicious! I cheated and used bottled lemon juice. I also halved the recipe, but that won't happen again-it's too good! Thanks Kitten!"
41654,52485,2005-01-09,5,"This a wonderful dish. I love the lemon/herb flavor. I did omit the oil and used Jasmine rice since it was what I had on hand. Since I usually cook for only 2, I had some left overs and feed them to my freezer. In entree containers with the baked chicken breasts and lemon green beans #24727 it reheated perfectly in the microwave! This is going to be a staple for me."
666933,259677,2009-09-20,5,"This was delicious.  I tried with the tomoatoes, shrimp, and asparagus.  It was a hit with the family"
37036,211175,2007-05-28,5,This rice dish is now one our favorites.  I made it for the ZWT3 (Garden Challenge) and was very pleased.  The flavor is perfect!  I followed the directions exactly and wouldn't change a thing!  Everytime I make this dish I will think of our sweet Amy!
136511,95365,2007-10-21,5,I drizzled this over the top of a loaf of banana bread that I made.  It was perfect.  Thanks for posting!
198154,92897,2015-04-24,4,"I made this for my family for dinner.  While it was a little messy to make, it was fairly easy. Next time I will season my chicken a little more before cooking. I let it marinade in zesty Italian dressing over night and my family still felt that the chicken itself didn&#039;t have enough flavor.  Due to weather I had to bake mine in the oven and it came out nice and juicy."
257771,140508,2005-11-11,4,"When both of my young grandsons both agree that something tastes great and ask that I make it again soon, then I know the recipe is a hit.  Thanks for this one."
369767,188834,2006-10-26,5,I'm a single 23 year old and just felt like i was throughing everything I could in the pan and low and behold it was delicious. Thank you.
801657,275158,2012-11-20,5,I've made this for Christmas.  I've made this for Christmas Eve dinner the last two years and will continue to make it every year.  It is excellent!  In fact it was my husband's favorite part of dinner!
1365545,249520,2009-08-26,5,"This was our first time trying pickles and this recipe was great.  The time involved was longer, but we tripled the recipe so that had an impact.  Initially, they seemed salty, but by the 2nd bite you really did not notice it.  We also used more dill than the recipe called for (I think because as neophytes we had a tough time figuring out a Ã¢â¬ÅheadÃ¢â¬ï¿½ of dill).  Good overall recipe."

465956,274257,2008-04-30,5,"These brownies were amazing!!!  The richness of the chocolate flavor and the dense texture made me not miss the flour at all.  Make sure to use the recommended pan size because these brownies are easily 1 inch tall.  Also, do wait for them to cool completely before serving.  These were spectacular!  I added 1 tablespoon of oil and 1/4 cup of Clabber Girl Sugar Replacer for Baking to the recipe but I'm not really sure it needed it.  My quest for the perfect low carb brownie has ended.  Thanks so much for sharing."
25455,13661,2002-08-05,5,"I must agree with the other reviews posted...fantastic cookie.  I used 1 1/4 cups of chocolate chips as that seemed like plenty.  The whole bag would have been too much.  Nice texture--not at all greasy like Toll House.  After first batch browned a little too much on the bottom, I lowered temperature to 350Â°F and cooked for 10 minutes--they cooked to golden perfection without browning the bottoms too much."
2001969883,70080,2018-02-03,5,Iâm so glad to find this recipe again ! I used to make these for my family when I was a teenager. I lost the recipe over 30 years ago. So happy to have it again. Thank you so much : )
250737,386620,2010-03-03,4,"This was a pretty easy, basic pizza crust recipe. It was a little bit bland even after adding oregano, fennel and basil. I think it could maybe use something to up the flavor but a good recipe nonetheless. I made 2 pizzas out of this. One was a personal size pan pizza and the crust was so thick I could hardly bite into it. Used the recipe for Ultimate Pizza Sauce and the pizza was terrific. This was my first homemade pizza and I can't wait to try again."
204585,29935,2005-03-22,1,"Very over-rated.  I've had much nicer ones.  Found it easier to mix in a bowl and pour into the cake tin.  Also I used lemon juice instead of vinegar.  Won't make this again.
"
91392,32295,2010-08-31,5,"Takes time, but easy, fairly cheap, and restuarant quality results.  The first time I made it I topped it with grilled squid.  The second time, sautÃ©ed mushrooms.  I did use less butter overall, with no bad effects and 1 cup of white wine in with the bouillon, which you can really taste in the final product, so don't do this if you don't like the taste of white wine."
539688,15350,2009-09-06,5,"This is really tasty. Everyone who I've served it to loves it. They might add their own salt or peper to it, but I would rather have to little than to much.One thing I would say is that it normally does take longer to really cook it and prep then is said, but that isn't a big deal...and maybe it is fine for some people. Thanks for posting this great recipe! :-)"
252271,16371,2009-11-19,5,My kids LOVED these...I also added Refried Beans and a little cheese.....you can't go wrong with this recipe!!!  Thanks for sharing!
22001,13909,2001-11-26,5,Easy to make and very tasty
269786,153539,2007-03-08,5,We served these with some melted chocolate to dip in. Fabulous!

69838,114984,2005-04-07,5,"I must admit that I rarely use my juicer right now, for one reason...that reason being that i find it so expensive to make good juices, and im on a really tight budget.  However, this just seemed too tempting, so I made it.  It is a fabulous and very healthful drink! I love the mixture of the grape and kiwi flavors... I dont believe Ive had this kind of mixture before.  I didnt make the garnish as it was just for us around the house :) Thanks for the recipe. This will be a regular for us ;)"

1020526,173735,2012-04-01,5,"This recipe surprised me because I was thinking it would be too plain, and I'd want to add something.  It's simple but delicious.  Of course I wonder what it would be like if I threw in some cooked potatoes or some tomatoes or maybe turned it into Mexican-style, but that's just me.  Very tasty and easy to eat.  Made for Pick a Chef Spring 2012."
6836,204110,2008-02-05,3,"Made these tonight after supper for a quick dessert for my diabetic DH.  I was wanting to make something more like a regular chocolate chip cookie, so I left out the cocoa and replaced it with an extra 1/4 cup of unbleached white flour.  I also used mini chocolate chips.  I did flatten them slightly but should have pressed them harder because these cookies do not spread at all.  They smelled delicious as they were baking (mmm ... warm chocolate - what's not to like?) and I thought they tasted pretty good.  DH wasn't as thrilled with them as I had hoped, but I will try them again & will try using the cocoa in the dough as well.  Thanks for posting!  -M =)"
369715,374417,2011-03-07,5,Very good and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly as written and we all loved it. It was so fresh tasting. Made for Spring PAC 2011.
289117,49613,2006-08-19,5,"Roosie,

I had my doubts about the boiling water thing, but this cake recipe is truly amazing.  It was so moist and delicious, and my guests raved about the icing!  I used a 13x9 glass dish and I baked it for about 40 minutes.  Thanks so much!"
89813,64893,2003-06-20,4,"I really liked the recipe. I added raisins to it. The original recipe reminded me of something my mother made when I was younger, but she put raisins in it, and ommited the walnuts. But I left the walnuts in, and it was great."
259064,215903,2007-10-16,5,"I just tried this tonight, and the flavor is amazing.  I mean YUMMY.  The DH did'nt even complain about the FF sour cream (nearly miraculous). This soup really doesn't taste low fat at all.  As the other reviewer mentioned, this is a fairly soupy chili, but that could easily be adjusted to suit your tastes.  Yum Yum Yum."
95743,33391,2003-09-26,5,"Great sandwich filling for me.  Spread it on a Wasa cracker for lunch. I used the bacon, sour cream, and cheddar, because I didn't have monterey jack.  Yum!  I like this sort of thing so I've tried several and this is the best of the bunch so far.  Thank you."
831406,95475,2010-01-03,5,So yummy and so easy!  Thanks!  :)
392641,218584,2007-11-30,5,"I'm so glad I found this here! A friend made this for Thanksgiving and I was fortunate to taste it. It was as good as it looked, especially with the pecans on top. Though a pumpkin cake, the flavor was not overpowering. Excellent with coffee! This is a must-try! Thanks for posting this, I wasn't able to squeeze the recipe out of her! ;)"
409779,141983,2011-01-03,5,we made this last night because it was highly rated.we added baked chtcken to it and cooked exactly to the tee.whole house loved it and we give it 5 stars will defitnily will make again
262312,146854,2009-01-12,5,"great munchies!  i did make a few changes:  i used an assortment of different nuts, i used more garlic powder and hot sauce than recommended plus i added lots of black pepper and a bit of cayenne.  i was nervous that it would be too salty with all the old bay, but if anything i think i'll add a bit next time.  i thought the flavors were great, but it just needed a bit more salt for us.  thanks for the fun keeper!!  will be making again for super bowl!!"
236959,87879,2009-04-13,5,"These were the cutest!  I used natural peanut butter, butterscotch chips instead of the the syrup and sugar and mini eggs instead of the jellybeans and they turned out fantastic and not too sweet.  The mixture was to goopy to shape into balls so I formed the nests into muffin tins, which made them a little bigger than I wanted, but they were still so good."
135566,479068,2013-04-19,3,The batter for these pancakes is very thin and I was concerned at how these would turn out.  The cakes cooked up nicely but are much thinner than we like. The cinnamon and chocolate is a great combination that was very good.  I will make this recipe again but will add less milk for a thicker pancake. Made for Spring 2013 Pick A Chef.
930100,309048,2009-07-20,4,This recipe is very similar to the Aztec brand of tortillas. Very simple to put together. I like to add beans and corn to the recipe.
385678,121624,2007-11-17,5,"Wow, this was terrific pesto for such few ingredients!  I doubled the recipe and we enjoyed it with some homemade bread.  I've never made pesto before because I can't get any pine nuts where I am living now, but this recipe was perfect as is.  Thanks for a new regualar!"
2001987880,339156,2018-05-09,5,I did not have enough peas so I added red cabbage and water chestnuts. What a great way to make veggies!
478451,42296,2009-01-18,5,I have made this several times and it tastes exactly the same as the saganaki served in Greek restaurants.  This last time I made this I made the mistake of slicing the cheese too thick - so it wasn't completely warmed through and in our opinion it wasn't as good.  It is great to serve this with bread to sop up all that goodness in the pan.  Thanks for posting Poppy.
225588,31314,2005-06-29,5,tastes just like a meatball sub! thanks for the tip about letting the italian bread sit out. i let it sit out for a day and it was still crispy in the casserole - yum! my only suggestion is to make more meatballs (about 1.5 lb) since this recipe only allows for 2-3 meatballs per person and my family loves meatballs!
131126,429509,2012-05-04,4,"I loved the  colorful presentation and agree it would be attractive on a buffet table. I reduce to make half & it still made a large bowl.  I thought the dressing could use a little more oomph, so after chilling I added sprinkles of this & that.  Next time I   will start with lemon pepper or lemon zest as I think the citrus would add that missing spark.  It definitely will be on my make again list! Thank you for sharing the recipe!  Made for Sring 2012 Pick A Chef."
213909,27768,2008-05-06,5,What a great alternative to a Dump Cake. Made this for a Graduation Party. It was a big hit. They loved the crunchy top. However I am wondering about the amount of melted butter? Them ixture was like very sof buiscuit dough and not at all like a Streussel Topping. I added more cake mix from a second box. Then refrigerated for 30? Min.. I was then able to pinch of clumps to distribute over the top. Great easy Dessert. Thanks. Koechin/Chef I since talked to the Chef of this recipe and the amount of Butter has been corrected!!! So anyone else using this recipe will have the perfect consistency! :-)
749879,209764,2014-01-02,5,"Fabulous!  I made it into a German Chocolate sheet cake, using a 7x11 pan and baking it about 35 minutes (I live at 7,000 feet and things usually need to bake longer than a recipe says).  It literally took me three minutes to throw it together.  I used 3/4 cup brown rice flour, 1/4 cup sweet rice flour, and 1/2 cup tapioca flour, and mixed it with a mixer until it was fluffy and a little lighter.  Thanks for a great, convenient recipe :)"
20480,361,2002-10-30,5,This such a great recipe.Fettuccini Alfredo is one of our favourite meals but I haven't made it years because of all that butter.I put the freshly grated Parmesan and the pepper mill on the table and it was like at the restaurant except better.Thanks for posting.
145352,165805,2012-03-05,4,Great flavor. I used it on some chicken tenders and grilled them quickly.
197023,7883,2005-09-17,5,"I was just as intrigued by this recipe when I came across it in the Canadian Forum as I had been when I first came across what is surely a younger sibling or perhaps a cousin recipe: Trick and Treat Muffins Recipe #125634.  Having made the muffins, I was fully confident of excellent results with Ritaâs chocolate cake recipe and the results were an absolute delight!  A deliciously moist and flavoursome cake which everyone has LOVED!  Everyone has wanted a second slice.  Iâm really looking forward to sharing this with others.  No-one but NO-ONE has guessed at that secret â beetroot - ingredient, and everyone is totally astonished when told that it is a major ingredient.  Be prepared to send a piece of this cake home with your friends when they try this and have some copies of the recipe on hand: theyâll want both!"
211184,68976,2006-10-16,5,"This delicious banana bread is  moist, rich, and buttery. I used a glass loaf pan sprayed with cooking spray. I only used 3 bananas because they were very large. The Banana Bread was done in exactly the time stated. My Mom called last night, and I had to break it to her that I found a banana bread the rivaled hers!Thanks for sharing another delicious recipe Kim. Nick's Mom"
705251,118242,2012-03-29,4,Very rich and fudgy brownie that is super easy to throw together.  Mine did take over 25 minutes to bake - so that is something to be very aware of with the recipe.  The flavors are outstanding though!  I used the chocolate chip addition (may be why more time was needed) this time and will try the chopped nuts the next time.  Nice addition to my quick dessert cookbook.  Tagged and made for I Recommend Tag game.
242729,344025,2009-01-02,5,"GORGEOUS and SO easy!!! Made today for lunch and VERY much enjoyed! I used spaghetti in place of fettuccine, and I am hanging on to this recipe, as it is PERFECT as a stand by for ""what shall we have for lunch today"" recipe! LOVED the addition of the cream cheese, I used Boursin left over from Christmas........and I added extra parmesan cheese, as we are real cheeseheads!! Made as the prize for Santa's Grotto in Holiday Tag - merci Breezer! FT:-)"
24386,81239,2004-11-16,5,"These potatoes were wonderful!  Good thing I didn't look at the nutrition facts before I made them. I usually smash them and add milk, but this was delicious without it. The sauteed garlic in the butter made them extra special. Another amazing recipe from CL. Thanks for sharing it."

117782,62994,2009-04-11,5,"WOW!  Absolutely tasty!
Followed the recipe as written, but lightly frosted, with lemon frosting, when cookies were cooling. I also cut down the baking time to eight min., since the bottoms were getting to dark. Very simple to whip together.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe."
318262,369679,2012-07-29,5,"Wow, I had a tapas party last night and I think this was my favorite of the many that made it on our table - and it was probably the most simple of them all too! I ended up using 5 roma tomatoes because my loaf was huge - even that didn't end up being enough. I also found out last minute my fresh garlic had gone bad so I mixed a bit of chopped garlic I have in my fridge into the tomato. Regardless, this dish was sooo sooo fresh and tasty. I think I like it even better than garlic bread! Thanks so much for sharing."
570040,80350,2010-06-22,0,"well - I sprang for all the ingredients and used most of my garden harvest of bok choy.  When you stir fry in oil first, it seals the greens, and the sauce just slips off, doesn't permeate.  I put the sauce on the fish I served with it instead and all enjoyed.  The bok choy was nice even without sauce, just stir fried in the oils!"
125325,94271,2005-08-30,4,"This was very good and simple. I used 1 cup oatmeat, 1 cup bread flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour and that worked out fine. Thanks!"
195879,48693,2005-04-02,0,I made this frittata and it is awesome. I used 1/2 cup parmesan cheese instead of 1/4 cup of two different cheeses and it was still great.  It is great as leftovers too 
233583,372666,2009-10-20,5,"WOW another winner Mike.  I love cream cheese and I lover garlic so this jumped out at me to try.  Cost wise this is great as buying a 6 oz container is over $2.00 and I can make this for less thaN 1/2.  I love this recipe! Have used it on a bagel, YUM.  Then made FT crusty bread and put it on that as well.  OMG heavenly.  Now I am hooked.  I will have to use the lowfat version of the cream cheese as I can eat the whole thing myself and the fat and calories ..... well.... ya know.  Excellent!  I am going to hijack the base of this recipe and try making everything cheese, with onions, chives, dill, garlic, etc. like you find at the coffee shops.  mmmm  mmmmm

I baked them for 30min and cooked them in marinara sauce for 40-45min. My friends loved them! Even my nephews who are pick eater loved them. I did not have to change a thing. Thank you for the recipe."
383346,239979,2013-04-02,5,The taste of these fries are so yummy.  I used parchment paper so my plate was easier to clean.  This is very easy to do.  Thanks Snowbaby :)  Made for PAC Spring 2013

Not enough potatoes or pickles.  To get a truly tasty soup you use some of the the pickle brine.
Nothing like Polish Village Cafe."
494867,53917,2012-10-07,5,"I thought ""green cabbage and mushrooms - sounds healthy."" Was I ever surprised when it turn out to be absolutely delicious too!  I made the cabbage in a Dutch oven.  Cooked the onions and mushrooms in a skillet, added the spices and cornstarch then mixed the whole thing together in the Dutch oven.  The cornstarch makes the sauce nice and silky, I really liked that.  This is a great recipe that just happens to be super healthy!"
53932,13640,2006-10-14,5,These were just so good.  I used a chicken soup base as well.  Quick and easy.  A great side for steak.  Thanks for sharing.

1388184,250952,2009-09-18,5,Tried this with half the pb and half the cereal (used Cinnamon Crunch) and it was okay...then added just a drizzle of honey!!! Wonderful!!! Will be sharing this with friends!! Thank you for a tasty snack.
357543,17225,2009-06-10,5,Yum! Yum! Yum!  I made this to use some of my leftover Easter ham & the entire family loved it.  I lightened the fat content a bit by substituting 2 T. of oil + 1/4 cup chicken broth for the oil & only using  3 T. of butter (rather than 1/4 cup margarine).  The flavor was still fantastic.  I also used fresh parmesan cheese.  Definitely a keeper.  I'll make this one again & again!

464080,429576,2010-08-02,4,"My neighbor gave me a bag full of tomatoes from her garden, so this was the perfect recipe for me!  I used fresh oregano instead of dried since I had it on hand.  I definitely think a bold olive oil works best with this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!"
93006,5274,2005-09-10,5,"Perfect - works like a charm!  And to me, much more convenient than having to buy a whole bag of the stuff and store it - instead just ""make"" the amount you need."
2000044434,146944,2016-12-21,5,"I have used this recipe for several years. It always gets rave reviews at Thanksgiving. I use 2 boxes of jiffy mix. I use my Vitamix to make the bread crumbs. I make the cornbread and bread crumbs the day before. As a time saver for holiday cooking, I use one tub each of fresh chopped onion and celery found in the produce department of the grocery store. I omit the salt and use seasoned pepper. I have the oval crockpot. I cook on high 2 1/2 hours. Stir and scrape sides if any is sticking. Cook on high 30 minutes more, then cook on low 30 minutes. Then I switch to keep warm. Comes out perfect every time."

The sauce is wonderful!!
Thank you for sharing!"
171683,42328,2008-08-04,5,"I finally made these after having the recipe in my cookbook for months.  The family loved them, especially DH.  I didn't have shallots, so I used onion.  I wasn't sure if I should melt the butter before adding it to the breadcrumb mixture?  I did, but found I needed to add another T of the bc and the cheese to use up the butter.  I also wasn't sure if I should pour the wine sauce over the cutlets or more on the sides/between so that they could simmer?  It took longer than 35 minutes to make because I had to brown the cutlets in two batches (even my huge 14"" skillet doesn't hold 6 cutlets).  So, we liked the final product, but the recipe confused me in spots."
542159,483959,2012-09-22,5,"Sorry this review might be a bit sparse as I made this as part of DH breakfast and he only said ""Yum!"" so I asked does it tasty like a Cremesicle? Again just one word ""Ya!"" man what are you going to do with them ""lol"". Thanks for the post."
187373,37409,2007-04-19,4,"Pretty good beans.  Used pecans instead of walnuts as that's what we had on hand. Also used the grated parmesan instead of fresh, although bet it is better with fresh! Have to serve really fast because hard to keep warm. Thanks a lot for sharing!"
845394,412529,2010-02-18,5,This was easy and good.  I made it along with a salad.  I used my dressing - - Light Salad Dressing (Fit Back into your Skinny Jeans) Recipe # 371856 and the meal was a success.  Thanks for sharing.
119956,395313,2010-03-08,4,This is a good soup that lends itself to variations. I used brown rice in place of the barley and added more broth.

678862,270139,2008-01-12,3,"I adapted this recipe quite a bit. As is, I would have rated it as a 2 - it just needed more flavor/seasoning for us - , after my changes would rate it a 4, so am choosing the middle ground with a 3. I expected going in that I would be changing it a little and chose it because I knew the fresh pineapple, beef and beans would taste good and it seemed easily adaptable, but I did give it a chance as written before changing. Here are the changes I made: I used leftover steak, so put the slices in a pan to warm them up and added about 3/4 - 1 cup of frozen onion, green & red pepper blend, then added somewhere between 1 and 2 Tbsp. of Pampered Chef Jamaican Jerk seasoning (I had no Hawaiian seasonings to add). I increased the fresh pineapple to 1 1/2 cups, added it to the meat mixture and tossed to blend. I also used 1/4 cup green onions and 1/4 cup cilantro. The chili beans were ok, but based on the changes made, next time I will use black beans. I'm glad I tagged this recipe (for Bev Tag) and will definitely make again with the changes. Thanks for the recipe - it is very adaptable and versatile - I guess my version would be Jamaican Soft Tacos, but there are quite a few different flavor combinations that would work...the wheels in my mind are already turning for next time...:)"

90611,79656,2004-04-07,5,"This was fabulous. I used Madeira Feist Rainwater and there is no need to experiement further. Next time I might start the madeira wine, beef stock, butter and pepper reduction earlier and then add it to the pan with the mushrooms after they have sauted in the pan goodies, as I thought the 20+ minute rest was not kind to that skinny chicken. We loved this!"
1392819,244193,2011-06-09,5,"WOW!!! I wish I could give this recipe six or seven stars! This cheesecake was simply amazing and garnered rave reviews from my guests, one of whom even equated it with Junior's! I can end my search for the perfect cheesecake recipe; I will certainly make this one again and again. Thank you!!"
121690,19941,2004-11-10,5,"I've had oranges in a Cointreau sauce before, but adding the vanilla bean was a stroke of genius. Superb!"
705251,264185,2010-07-22,5,This is truly a delight to make and even more of a delight to eat.  I loved all the mix of veggies and fruit with the chicken.  I used some leftover rotisserie chicken and made the dressing as written.  Very full of flavor but light on the waistline.  Thanks Pat for sharing this fantastic recipe in the Went to the Market Tag game
176615,184351,2007-10-03,5,A fabulous breakfast that even kids can make. I discovered that my picky son will actually eat peanut butter toast if mini chocolate chips are on top. Great idea!! Protein and complex carbs are the perfect combination to send them off to school ready to learn. Thanks for sharing the recipe! Made for PAC Fall 2007.
217482,378666,2009-10-01,5,"This is what I call real food. Bursting with flavour, and so simple too. Only difference to the recipe I made was to use fresh ginger and parsely and lamb chops not a fillet. This is a great recipe, try it yourself and be impressed! Made for Aus/Nz recipe swap #32 ;-)"
227978,484086,2014-05-13,5,"This was excellent, Elisabetta47.  The breaded pork chops are fine on their own, but the delicious sage cream sauce really dresses them up nicely.  And serving them on a bed of fresh spinach added a lovely touch (and was a great way to add iron to our diet).  I made two minor adjustments though.  The blade of my food processor lies rather high, and it didn&#039;t really swoosh any of the sauce ingredients, so I used my immersion blender (which didn&#039;t really process, just mixed well).  So my sauce was not really pulverized but simply a sauce with chunks of spinach leaves that didn&#039;t get processed well.  But that didn&#039;t take away from the taste.  And I was concerned that cooking only 3 minutes per side was enough for pork, so I let them saut&eacute; in the skillet for about 10 minutes per side.  But the rest of the recipe was made as written, and it was delicious and thoroughly enjoyed by everyone.  Made for Spring 2014 Pick-A-Chef."
1135521,150042,2011-01-15,2,"I actually came across this when I mistakenly went to another recipe site.  I was looking for pad thai but was drawn in with a vegan recipe (minus the egg) so I did this one instead.  First the good:  Like pad thai, it combines noodles, ginger, garlic, bean sprouts, scallions and nuts.  The chopped cilantro was lovely.  Now the bad:  as written it is nearly spiceless.  When working with tofu it's critically important to drain and marinate or it's just a bunch of spongy flavorless blobs.  I added chili garlic sauce and did marinate the tofu for 20 minutes but that was not nearly enough time.  I definitely threw this recipe out - there are so many better recipes on this site ."
192708,10150,2005-02-15,0,"very very yummy, I added another banana and only about 1 1/4 cups of berries, I love the banana flavour."
353021,25121,2007-01-02,4,this is pretty good!even when i skipped pork and the patis and green beans and i used egg noodles instead of wheat noodles. the noodles were a bit too tender. but my danish friends still loved it! nice!
102058,307773,2008-06-18,3,We liked this.. maybe it's because shrimp have been on our menu a lot lately and there has been some stiff competition from other zaar recipes.. DH and I liked this a lot but it's not going to be in our mega favourites list. Yes we HAVE become harsh food critics. I used recipe#190959 to make the coconut milk and the resulting smell of this dish was excellent. It was just unexpected that the smell didn't translate enough to the taste as much as we expected... I did used dried coriander (cilantro) though becuase the supermarket was out of fresh.. and I WOULD like to give this recipe another go with fresh because that can often make a world of difference. Please see my Rating System.. I have given this 3 stars for now but will give this a second go with fresh coriander and if needs be will update my review. Thanks!
2002232903,214377,2018-07-29,5,This turned out awesome so glad i found it
379302,46780,2006-11-07,4,This was a really good cheesecake. The pumpkin taste did not come through too much so depending on your taste that may be good or bad.  I made this at Thanksgiving and it was a hit with my whole family.
1177249,75475,2010-02-26,5,"this is the only soup my son, who hates potatoes, has ever had more than 2 bites of. he ignored his chicken nuggets and filled up on this soup instead! i made exactly except added celery and used whole wheat flour."
573325,186737,2011-10-06,5,"What a wonderful recipe for cornbread! This is so special and yummy, mmm! The texture is very fluffy and grainy, just like a good cornbread should be. Its crusty on the outside and has a lovely sweet oniony taste. YUM!<br/>I used home made applesauce in place of the shortening, left out the sugar and reduced the salt to 1/4 ts. It came out fantastic and Ill definitely make this again. I especially loved the upside down idea! :)<br/>Made and reviewed for Went to the Market Tag Game September 2011."
246482,504303,2017-08-26,5,I just made a bit of it and I really enjoyed the taste and I added a bit on my noodles at the same tim . Made for CQ 2017.
174991,125957,2006-04-08,5,These are nice and light and creamy and the taste is wonderful.  I baked them at 400 for about 20 mins.  It's a keeper.
102058,64306,2005-12-28,3,"The amount of choc chips I used was approximate since I used a bar of semi sweet chocolate (we can't get chips here in NL easily) and the taste was really yummy, but a bit too chewy... did I cook it on too high a heat? did the approximation of the chocolate upset the balance? it tasted great and I will definiately make it again, but I will need to lessen the stickiness  of it all with some more accurate guesswork on my available ingredients before it really becomes a favourite. It's NOT a flop, it just needs some work on my part :)Please see my (tough) rating system, a wonderful 3 stars ! Thanks !!!"
2841543,63828,2013-05-27,5,"this works perfect but for a TENDERLOIN not a pork loin!I read most of the 238 reviews and the ones that did not work well the tenderloin was over 2lbs... people there is a difference between a tenderloin and a loin, tenderloins are usually not more than a little over a pound, loins are much bigger and a tougher cut of meat.  The tenderloin is only about an inch or two around, a loin is 3-5 inches around.  If you follow directions you will have an excellent piece of meat but use a TENDERLOIN!"
131021,282040,2009-07-18,5,"I made a beautiful lilac frosting for my daughter's birthday cake. I accidently added too much almond extract but other than that i think it was great. It did unnerve me using all that shortening so I won't make it often, but for special occasions."
481463,269329,2008-03-17,5,I am making this tonight & was browsing to see if anyone had already posted it. I LOVE IT!! It's so easy & makes the house smell SOOOOO good!
385423,39087,2007-02-02,5,I know this recipe doesn't need any more stars but I just had to say how great it is!  My DH's favorite!
254909,66421,2006-07-10,5,Loved this!  I cut it down to one serving (which was giant sized).  I took Janie Cooper's suggestion and used  light vanilla yogurt instead of the water.  It still didn't have the consistency I wanted so I threw in two ice cubes and--voila!  Perfect!  Thanks so much.
67656,119278,2005-09-28,0,"After searching high and low for vegetable suet, I gave up and used ordinary canola oil.  I'm guessing this resulted in my dumplings being less tender than expected, but the flavor was so good.  They absorbed quite a bit of the flavor from the black eyed pea masala yet still had quite a bit in there own right.  And the chickpeas were a great addition givng the puffs a bit more texture.   Dumplings are quite and induldgence for me but these were well worth it. Thanks Caroline. "
190441,48754,2012-10-08,0,I make this recipe all the time! It is WONDERFUL!!!!! Funny to see peoples faces when they find out it is red onion jelly..I don't tell them until AFTER they try it. Have not found one person as of yet that does not like this jelly. Great for Christmas gifts given with a roll of ritz crackers.
383346,370164,2012-06-18,5,"It was our first time to eat shrimps with bacon.  It's delicious.  We loved that.  We tried with lemon juice on it, but we prefered without.  Thanks Diner :)  Made for PRMR tag game"
207478,23514,2006-12-09,5,Delicious!!  This went really well with CountryLady's Chicken Souvlaki #56768.  I used zucchini instead of cucumber because I just can't stand them.  DH didn't miss the cukes so I think the switch was good.  Thanks!!
454804,307807,2008-12-10,5,These are wonderful. So simple to make. I agree very addicting. Can't wait to make for Christmas.
6258,58823,2003-07-21,5,"Carol, you have a winner in this one!  The flavors of the herbs combined with the sausage brought out the best of the canned beans (I used cannellini).  This is a hearty, and filling dish with plenty of flavor.  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe that is now in my t&t cookbook. :-)"
2001974064,22507,2018-02-04,0,"I have made rouladen several times, and it's one of those recipes that varies based on the region and family preferences. However, I will say that Dijon mustard jut doesn't cut it. A good, German, stone ground mustard is much more flavorful and authentic. And the dill pickle spear is a must!"
402053,163928,2008-01-06,5,"one of my favourites.. i always use less butter than she calls for, and more peas.."
526666,383260,2009-12-07,5,"I would like to re-name this drink The ""Absolute de-'Stress'-er!"" It was perfect after a busy week, and much enjoyed. The flavors are familiar, yet different, and I enjoyed the combination! These would be perfect by the pool on a hot day! I'm looking forward to sharing this with my girlfriends! Thanks for sharing with us, **Tink**!"
372643,140683,2006-12-04,5,"So easy and delicious. I made it for Thanksgiving and was very happy with the results. I don't like making gravy, I know, my friends say its so easy to make, but for some reason, I'm never pleased with the taste or the effort. This recipe is very tasty and easy to make. I used turkey stock because I had it on hand and I didn't add the salt, but that is a matter of personal taste. I believe this gravy would be good with chicken and pork too. Definitely a keeper.... Pi-E"
813584,4627,2010-01-17,5,This was fantastic!  I halved the recipe and still have enough left over for another meal.  I made homemade chips with the leftover tortillas and spinkled them on top of the soup.  I will DEFINITELY make this again!  My husband likes it much better than the one we tried from a local store!  Thank you so much!
198601,169758,2008-07-16,4,"These are good, but I just couldn't quite give 5 stars.  They are crunchy on the outside and soft/chewy inside.  I would be sure to check after 15 minutes in the oven next time, as my got a little too cooked after 20 minutes.  I also added 1/4 c.  of frozen concentrated juice to add some flavor.  Got 6 'normal' size bagels, although I probably used 3 1/2 c. flour.  May make again."
57601,31175,2003-01-25,5,"Kate, these are great!  What a wonderful way to spice up plain old cheeseburgers!  They are so simple to make, too.  My family loves cheese, so we did add some on top.  This is definitely a keeper."
131126,129230,2005-07-16,5,"Absolutely delicious!!! I was drawn to this recipe because of the use of the eggplant in the dumplings....a very different idea, but one that works.  The dumplings are tender, light, fluffy, and very yummy!  I liked the soup too.  The only thing I will do different next time is to chop the tomatoes a little more.  This is definitely on my repeat list!!  Thank you CoolMonday for sharing this wonderful recipe!  "
201581,292921,2009-04-07,5,"I made 1 potato as directed on my George Forman grill (we had a snow storm today) Instead of garlic salt I used smoked paprika, so it tasted like BBQ chips. Very good and easy too. Thanks Hokie, I will be making these on the grill if summer ever gets here! :lol: Made and enjoyed for PAC Spring '09."
37449,48906,2002-12-24,5,"Well, all 4 of us liked this focaccia bread! The garlic smelled so good! We had it with beef stew and I used buttermilk and a mixed blend of romano and parmesan cheese. Delicious! Thanks for sharing this quick and yummy recipe!"
679759,73831,2008-04-22,5,"Due to the comments from others I added just a bit more water and was able to get all four cups of flour in.
The bread turned out beautiful!  I did not put any seeds or anything because of what I was serving it with but it still tasted wonderful.  My kids especially enjoyed it toasted the next day.  Yes it takes awhile to make but it is worth it.  I ended up with a 15 inch 3 strand braid that was about 4 inches high in the center when baked.  I think that it would make wonderful french toast!"
199953,87925,2007-04-20,5,"Mmmmm...excellent brownies! They are REALLY rich. Since you said in your description that they were sweet, I used unsweetened Ghiradelli chocolate for part of the chocolate that you melt. I made them the night before and we heated them in the microwave and served with vanilla ice cream. The melty chocolate chips were sooooo good."
15712,33103,2002-07-26,4,This is a quite good mixture of tastes.  It took me longer than 10 minutes of prep time.  The only changes I would make would be to add the cornstarch to the liquids before adding the pork and to hold off on adding the pineapple until the last few minutes (giving the peppers time to soften without overdoing the pineapple).
161938,505477,2014-06-02,3,"not bad for a low-fat cookie.  i see others are saying they&#039;re bitter.  i suppose this is because the recipe doesn&#039;t specify dutched cocoa, and they&#039;re using plain old hershey&#039;s &quot;natural cocoa&quot;.  the recipe says &quot;dark&quot;, which isn&#039;t really a specific kind of cocoa.  i suspect the writer really intended for people to use the hershey&#039;s special dark, which is 50% dutched and 50% black cocoa, so that&#039;s what i used.  no bitterness here.-------- i also added 1/4 tsp salt and a tbsp or two of agave nectar since i&#039;m assuming the recipe creator used mainstream PB and apple sauce, and i used organic/freshly ground.  i would use a little bit more of each next time.  maybe 1/2 tsp and 1/8 cup respectively.---------- if i make these again, i do think i may substitute a tb or two of oil for some apple sauce.  (since they were slightly dry, and i&#039;m not an oil hater. i bet they&#039;d be great with coconut oil!)  they were better when they were flattened, since they don&#039;t spread, and the ones that remained as balls didn&#039;t cook all the way through, but that&#039;s a preference. if you like squishy oat balls, more power to you!  :-)  this also means you can crowd them on the pan with no issues.---------- i also think i might add peanuts to it since the cocoa was a bigger flavor than the other flavors. and what the heck, i may just replace the applesauce with another banana.  (this is starting to feel like a brand new recipe.)"
28087,155847,2012-05-14,5,"Delicious macaroni salad with a great selection of ingredients, I liked the addition of the black olives, I used sliced Calamata olives. I did replace the red onion with scallions as that is what I had on hand. This will go into my summer salad rotation and be made often. Thanks! Made for the ""Down on the Farm"" Photo Tag 2012."
101823,105993,2006-03-17,5,Great seasoning.  I used this to prepare Crockpot Chicken Taco Meat (recipe #4957).  It worked perfectly and had excellent flavor.  This will be repeated in our home.
120264,165220,2013-07-06,0,"I made these last night and they were really delicious, we were licking our fingers.  I did add some salami slices to the meat."
463435,227990,2008-03-13,5,"Very Yummy! We all enjoyed this very much...even me, and I do not like Jell-O. I love the simplicity of this recipe and how well the pie holds together when sliced, it makes it a perfect desert to take to a potluck or picnic. As mentioned in the AUS/NZ Swap, I will definitely be making this again real soon :o)"
2001001018,63786,2016-05-05,5,"These were perfect! This recipe was simple, yet it very authentic! Thanks for sharing!"
552996,192391,2012-05-09,5,Perfect!  I didn't change a thing and it turned out great.
1926335,435750,2011-09-09,5,This was a great recipe.  Love to use up that zucchini.  We added black olives and used turkey italian sausage and pizza sauce.  This was so good. We will be making this agian.
198154,25708,2017-01-12,4,"Due to rain, we I had bake our salmon in the oven. I baked them in foil packets so they didn't get dried out. The adults really liked it. The kids, not so much. Served with Rosemary Garlic bread and tossed salads"
2001773389,455567,2018-11-12,5,"My wife and I both loved this! Great combination of spices. We kept it simple and served with Trader Joe's &quot;middle eastern&quot; flatbread and some hummus. My wife cut hers into bite sizes and made a &quot;taco&quot; with it and loved it. We were even able to get this one in on a weeknight! We used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and so they cooked a little quicker (did 25 minutes instead of 30). Thank you!"
220062,103461,2005-06-09,5,"very good. I made this with chicken and chopped the chiken real fine like the ground beef. Our friends don't eat beef, so we tried chicken! I have had this both ways and we were pleased with the out come. It was almost hard to tell it was chicken over the taco seasoning. I perfer beef.  But it's  nice to know this recipe taste excellent both ways. I also only put half the beans in, personal perfrence!"
455539,190032,2009-11-06,5,I only needed to make one single Po' Boy for little ol' me so I used a toasted sesame seed hamburger bun and changed the svg size to one. But I baked 4 servings of fish sticks. (Quicker sandwiches later if they are good!) Otherwise I made as instructed.  I can't BELIEVE I've never thought to put fish sticks on a bun! What a great sandwich!  It was so good that I made and ate another one with a side of Doritos.  Now I have to go get on the treadmill! Thanks for the great idea!  I'm sure to throw these together often.  :-)
450933,26876,2007-03-10,5,"I made made this this morning and it was a huge hit.  Everyone took seconds, asked what it was and even wanted to know the recipe.    Thanks for a great recipe! :-)"
715131,115086,2010-12-28,5,"Great soup!!  Thanks for the recipe.  I made this with Thanksgiving leftovers, loved it so much made it again with chicken.  Now making it again with Christmas turkey leftovers.  FAB!!"
449887,259183,2009-03-23,4,This was really yummy! I had to add two tablespoons of flour at the end. Thank-you for posting!
143917,6963,2007-11-29,5,Enoyed these muffins. Made two slight changes though--left out the allspice and used half whole wheat flour and half white flour. Would make again.
54447,84861,2008-07-02,5,"I'm adding this to my previous rating.  This recipe is still in my personal cookbook and I've made it many times and it just gets better each time.  Today, I added just a small handful of dry macaroni and it is awesome.  When I first used this recipe, I was on a no carb diet.  Now I'm on a low carb diet and it's absolutely wonderful!!"
46545,106251,2010-03-09,5,"What else can I say after hundreds of reviews?  Cooking time was perfect, and I was suprised at how the rosemary and garlic flavors were infused in the cauliflower... or was it just the delicious aroma?  Whatever, it turned out great. Thanks so much for posting this one!"
280166,276458,2010-03-23,5,"This was ooey-gooey dee-liciousness!  I used leftover rice from the Chinese restaurant, added some garlic, cumin and chili powder.  Next time, I want to add shredded chicken and stuff poblano peppers.  Thanks for posting!"
107308,69418,2004-05-10,5,"We really enjoyed the flavor of this fast and easy roll up sandwich.  The avocado, mayo, and lime mixture has the most wonderful flavor.  I will use it on other sandwiches.  I used romaine and smoked turkey.  Be sure to use the 10 inch tortillas as directed...I used smaller ones and they did not roll up well because they were too full.  This will be made often at our house...a new sandwich recipe is always welcome here!"
2209239,475446,2012-03-12,0,this sounds excellent!  can't wait to try it!
1331594,305341,2009-08-02,5,Followed the recipe to a tee and the only suggestion I would make is to let the cutlets sit in a buttermilk bath prior to dipping in the egg mixture. The buttermilk bath will tenderize the meat and add a nice zip that will also help the flour stick to the cutlets.
87023,68961,2005-02-28,5,"I cut this recipe in half and it worked fine and I must say that it really does taste as good as it looks. Marinated the tofu for about 2 hours.  This will go into my favourites.  Must add, put a few chilli flakes on top as well."
1391631,141716,2009-09-22,5,This was a great alternative to fried fingers.  My husband even said he prefered them this way!
672534,386862,2016-03-26,5,"I have to admit, I did make a few adjustments.  I was short of pasta, so I threw in a can of drained pinto beans.  Also, I had several containers of frozen tomato sauce, so I didn&#039;t measure that, just guessed.  Instead of Tabasco sauce, I used a few dashes of Cholula hot sauce (my favorite/less vinegar.)  Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe except for using salt-free tomatoes and tomato sauce.  I did add a tad bit of salt to make up for that after tasting.  I suggest that you top the cheese with a thin layer of crushed tortilla chips.  (I felt there was something lacking, so I crushed up a few and added it to the serving on my plate.  It was an improvement.)  I will most likely make this again.  It was quick and easy, and hubby wanted seconds, so that was the clue that he liked it too."
1072593,303946,2009-07-23,5,A riot of flavors ready to coerce your tastebuds into submission!  Made for PRMR.
26512,12709,2002-03-22,5,"This is the best roast chicken I've ever had. I made two changes - I stuffed the chicken cavity with a sliced whole onion and lemons and I stuffed sliced lemon under the skin of the breast meat. I've never had chicken this moist and so flavorful! This is a new family favorite, thanks!"
303971,27208,2011-01-02,5,"So easy to make and tasty too.  I added baby carrots, potatoes and onion before it finished cooking.  I thought there would be left overs for a few days, but boy was I wrong.  This is a keeper for sure."
123871,32503,2009-05-28,5,Yummy!! I marinaded the chicken the night before and used all the veggies and added onion and red pepper. Great easy recipe.
1803632450,129258,2015-01-08,5,Love these! Very delicious. They freeze wonderfully too. I think I&#039;ll start making double batches and freezing the left overs for a quick breakfast during the week!
511388,202131,2009-03-12,5,YUM!  This is so good! I made it the night before my husband's men's group and then he just had to warm it up n the morning.  Very good!!!
607692,98859,2009-10-25,5,"Perfect!
Just a note for novices...don't add too much water (like I did) or you'll be going at it all day adding more apples to thicken it up!"
47892,127262,2006-10-27,5,"I chose the Lebanese Marinade. It was delicious except one big thing: I omitted the thyme. Hope that doesn't place me on the Principal's Bad List.
Marinated one whole chicken for about eight hours. Served with couscous and parsley salad. Thanks for posting. cg"
138376,101136,2005-01-27,5,"This is wonderful, reminds me of cheesecake."
724516,73975,2011-05-15,5,"This tasted wonderful, but I am very sorry about the picture I used portobello mushrooms and it made the sauce very dark so sorry but I can't fault the recipe or the taste, but I wish I had used some lighter mushrooms. If you would like to remove the photo that would be ok with me. Made for Honor thy Mother the diabetic forum May 2011."
80998,227043,2008-07-10,5,"We really enjoyed this.  Hubby loves Mongolian Barbque, but we don't get to have it often.  He alsolove ramen noodles, so when I saw this recipe I had to try it.  It was a hit.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I left out the bacon in interset of making it a little lighter.  I also skipped the cabbage simply because I forgot to pick one up.  Hubby and I loved it.  Served with an egg roll."
27442,68774,2003-11-03,5,"This is wonderful to taste, and very easy to make.  I cheated and had a bought, unbaked pie crust.  It is simple to make and, in my opinion it tastes best served cold.  I did try it while it was still warm, but I must have been a little too eager, as I burned my tongue.  But the wonderful aroma that was wafting around was more than I could resist.  Thanks for sharing Di."

180962,69745,2004-12-17,0,"I lived in Central Asia for years.I love this salad.I'd show how to make it in right way.This salad made by Korean peole who lives in Cenral Asia(exUSSR)
1. Use large bowl. Mix carrots with spices and add a little bit of sesame seeds and few drops of sesame oil and vinegar(use strong vinegar)and put it away for 30 min.
Korean people use cotton seed oil for this salad.
2.Fryed small onion in cotton oil(after trash away this onion).Make sure oil is really hot. Pour hot oil into salad and mixed with salad(by hands).If you dont have cotton oil then use sunflower oil (dont fry onion in this case).
Put salad in fridge for 2 - 4 days(put some wieght on salad to press it down) Enjoy it."
288403,220204,2009-02-01,5,"Excellent recipe. This is my first taste of fennel and I was nervous about preparing it. I found this recipe and gave it a try. I used 3 large, boneless breasts as opposed to thighs, so the cooking time was decreased.  I didn't have white pepper so used black and I was worried it would be too peppery, but it was perfect. Chicken was very tender with a hint of sweet flavor from the fennel. My kids noticed the different taste and still ate all they were served, so they approve. Very good dish and a success for my first venture with fennel. Thanks for a keeper."
116643,16754,2004-01-25,5,Very very tasty and very very easy.  We like our chili a little spicier but this was delicious.
308666,341050,2009-10-11,5,"I have put bacon on my turkey's for years (can't remember who I heard it from), and the bird always comes out moist and delish.  I also put whatever veggies/fruits I have on hand to stuff in the bird's cavity (apples, oranges, carrots, potatoes, whatever), they all get discarded so it doesn't matter.  And the gravy from the bacon and turkey drippings is to die for.  Thanks MrsM1021 for submitting this recipe so other people can enjoy what we already do."
201581,398424,2011-03-27,5,"I made half the recipe, skipped the bacon but used the ham. I liked the add-in of cream cheese and no flour. This was served with a green salad to make a complete meal. Thanks for posting Uncle 12. Made for Pick A Chef Spring 2011."
895132,413056,2012-01-02,5,"This is fabulous! I used recipe #404610 to make it gluten free, and it worked so well! My first broccoli bread, and I'll make it again soon! Thanks for sharing.<br/>Made for Healthy Choices ABC"
358544,66121,2009-12-06,5,My DH and I really enjoyed this recipe. Thank you for posting.
281348,105104,2008-11-04,5,Wonderful! I halved the recipe (but not the spices) - upped the garlic to 3 cloves and reduced the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon. It was really very tasty - I will definately make again. Thanks!
860079,59043,2009-06-05,5,"This was a REALLY good drink ~ and I was skeptical about the root beer but it was great ~ I used diet IBC! Thanks Kim127, made for ZWT5, Bodacious Brickhouse Babes."
100149,116610,2005-12-26,5,"I made this for Christmas dinner, I even made extra.  Now I was warned that no one in my family liked asparagus.  They were the only part of the otherwise basically standard dinner that was ""different"".  People were complaining that I didn't make more!  So easy and beautifully presented.  I will be making this more often with regular meals as well.  "
21752,371150,2009-05-13,5,"Garlic and olive oil optional in my family?  Not going to happen, it's mandatory!  I had a baguette sitting on the counter since yesterday and this was the perfect recipe to use it.  I toasted the bread slightly, rubbed some mashed garlic into it, then topped with tomato slices and drizzled with the oil.  In our house 4 slices will serve one person, not 4 people as the recipe states, so I just quadrupled the recipe for the three of us, and not a crumb was left!  Tapas, shmapas, this was a pefect lunch with some Moscato on the side.  Made for ZWT5."
231054,8507,2009-05-20,5,I've been making this salad for several years.  It's especially wonderful when I can get my hands on some vine ripe tomatoes at the peak of the season.  I also like to use fresh Mozzarella -- and I never omit the balsamic vinegar.
58104,123254,2005-06-15,4,I roasted the peppers stove top right on the flame and placed in a paper bag to steam. Then peeled them. This was different. Tomatillos with butter and cream! I`m just not used to. But it was good kinda mild. So I added some cilantro! And a squeeze of lime. Loved the smoked shrimp!That was easy and a slight smokieness.
928033,426817,2013-05-12,5,"These are terrific!  And the buttercream recipe is something I will use again and again.  I took the buttercream up a notch by using a combination of vanilla and raspberry extract (find it in any grocery store) and tinting it a very very pale shade of pink by adding a very scant few drops of red extract.  The tinted frosting made them look professionally prepared - I put the buttercream in a gallon-sized ziplock bag, cut off one corner and used it like a pastry bag.  The slight raspberry flavor of the buttercream made the flavor of the filling really pop...do try them this way, you will NOT be disappointed. Perfect for a wedding or baby shower, I used mine for Mothers Day and I was proud to serve them."
406903,94152,2008-11-02,5,"I don't know whether to thank you for your recipe, or shake my fist at you!  :o)  This is a very, very tasty recipe that is way too easy to make.  The only change I made was that I used vanilla-sugar, but I'm sure regular sugar would be just as good.  Easy to make, most likely have the ingredients on hand, turns out fabulous...thank you!  I'll be making this recipe again for sure."
371126,107853,2010-01-24,5,Very yummy and easy to play with - left out the sprouts (didn't have any) and snow peas; added carrots; and had sauteed mushroom on the side for those that wanted them.
675216,195820,2008-01-31,4,"This recipe was so good when I added a tsp of beef boullion pwd.  Also, tried sauteed mushrooms and package of uncle bens wild rice mix (instead of white rice) to make it even more tasty."
241054,56902,2005-09-05,5,"I haven't even made this yet, but I'm already drooooling all over my keyboard. Can't wait!!!!Thanks CL!...Doggydog;)"
2000326563,31750,2015-07-09,0,Very disappointing!
187373,11984,2010-07-04,5,This is a fantastic recipe!  I made a half recipe using 2 eggs and made 12 muffins.  I used 1/4 cup applesauce in place of some of the oil and used half splenda/half sugar.  I used some shredded carrot in place of some of the zucchini.  So delicious! Will definitely make again!
116970,59056,2005-09-10,5,mmmmmmm yummy little meatloaves and they freeze and reheat great!
6357,82586,2004-02-01,5,This made a very nice cake and went great when I served it with maple syrup - too yummy for words! I did use margarine as a substitute for butter and low-fat plain yogurt as a substitute for sour cream. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing:-)
808027,210757,2010-09-29,5,"Love this soup!  It has to be the easiest, quickest soup I've ever made, but it is packed with flavor and has a nice kick to it.  I opted to puree the soup in the blender as I like my cream of broccoli soup creamier and without chunks of vegetables in it.  This is really good stuff...love that it is also healthy, too."
357987,154050,2008-01-02,5,"I thought this was fabulous, so did my 11 month old and 3 year old daughters!  I used dried rosemary and a red potato out of necessity.  We topped with freshly grated parmesan.  It was a wonderful, comfy soup and very healthy!

Thanks for posting!  Gotta love Giada!"
1316630,181994,2009-07-06,5,"This was great as is, can't wait to try it in the morning with scrambled eggs!"
945299,139380,2014-09-28,4,really tasty - I will make this again - it is almost a carmel-apple pie with the brown sugar and the butter :)  I did make some changes: added 1+ Tbs of flour to the apples after adding the brown sugar and spices.  The flour keeps the filling from running (something my mom always added for apple pies)
741457,42071,2008-01-26,5,"This soup was excellent! My family loved it.I did change 2 things, I put in 4 T of flour instead of 3 and I used a pound of Velveeta Cheese. It thickened it up a lot. Best of all it's ready to eat as soon as it's done! It was very easy to make and took no time at all."
573577,400468,2012-02-15,5,"These are easy to make and taste fantastic! I only had baker's bran but already ordered oat fiber to try again. I used the first 15 minutes of my bread machine's dough cycle to get the first ingredients mixed, then removed for 35 minutes, added back into bread machine pan, added the rest of the flour, mixed 8 minutes, then removed to rise as instructed. Perfect dough to work with, lovely little different buns, great for egg breakfast sandwiches, I think! EDIT: I ordered oat fiber and made these again immediately. We all PREFER the original recipe, including my 6 and 4 year olds. who are not at all picky but very selective. I will probably be the only one to eat the oat ones so that they are not wasted. My daughter requests these for her lunch box sandwich everyday now! We will keep this recipe (the original post) and repeat many times.....thanks again!"
286566,313811,2009-02-03,5,"We thoroughly enjoyed these tonight with a peppered roasted leg of lamb and steamed vegies.  I did use fresh rosemary and basil finely chopped (about 1 teaspoon of each).  I was worried about the cooking time but it worked out correct and gave a lovely crispy potatoe with a soft centre.  I also peeled my potatoes (that was the only way the rest of the family would eat them - I personally prefer skin on but I am outvoted).  The only change I would consider is making it half butter and half oil or using ghee.  Thank you Acadia for a recipe that the DH has asked to be served again, made for Potluck Tag."
449014,161870,2007-07-20,4,My daughter and I love this dish.  My husband thinks it takes kinda like chili mac so it's not his favorite but since he travels this is my go to dish for when he's gone.  It's super easy and my 3 year old loves to help!  Great recipe
227978,298889,2008-10-16,5,"This was delicious.  The two different cheeses added a very nice addition to the risotto.  It's too cold outside for outdoor grilling, so I baked the chicken breasts using the marinade as listed.  I will definitely make this again, though next time I think I might try spinach in place of the arugula (only because everyone in my family loves spinach but only moderately tolerates arugula).  I made this for PAC Fall '08.  Yum!"
199657,98463,2010-03-27,5,"Very nice!  My first crack at hamburger buns.  I also added 1/2 whole wheat.
I was skeptical that the smashed circles I made would actually rise evenly (and not just puff up in the middle), but the did!  They turned out just great! There was NO WAY to knead it per the instructions and I eye-balled the flour after the initial measurements. My final knead resulted in a saggy dough--like if I was making bread, I'd expect it to be tighter, but wanting the smashed circles to stay smashed, I though less flour would work, and it did!"
126440,2496,2011-10-17,5,Very easy but delicious cake.  I made half a recipe using a 9X9 inch pan.  Turned out great but may have over baked it a bit.  Baked for 35 min.  I did use the choc. buttercream for the frosting which was also great.  Made for a very rich birthday cake.  Want to try it with coffee next time.
44372,53306,2003-02-15,5,"Wonderfully aromatic, the blend of spices truly complimented the chicken.  I served this over steamed basmati rice, and garnished with extra chopped cilantro.  The level of heat was right on too...not too spicy, or too mild.  Adding the garam masala and cilantro after cooking really intesified their flavor.  Fabulous recipe!  We loved it!"
227978,113382,2008-05-20,5,"Awesome recipe! I make these mints every year for Christmas. They're very easy to make, and the recipe makes plenty. And they really do taste like the famous Frango Mints! They tend to go quite fast at our big family Christmas party. One word of caution about sticking though. The mints are easy to handle while they're still chilled...but after they've been out for a while and are at room temperature, the mints soften up and end up sticking to whatever platter I place them on (even if I use waxed paper or fancy paper doily liners). So, for the last couple of years, I've dropped the bits of candy directly into those small paper candy liners (instead of onto waxed paper). It makes it much easier to handle the mints after they softened to room temperature. And the festive holiday designs or bright colors on those paper candy cups makes for a nice touch to our holiday buffet table."
498271,461561,2011-08-12,4,"Great versatile salad!  Left out the onions as I don't care for them, otherwise made as directed.  Fresh and tasty - thanks for sharing the recipe!"
131126,317872,2008-08-25,4,I thought these were very cute & they would be adorable baked in mini muffin pans for a bite size appetizer tray. I liked the southwest flavors of the chicken mixture.  I think one could even add scallions or replace the hot sauce with chipolte if desired.  As mentioned by the other reviewers I needed more phyllo.  I added several sheets and am  glad I did.  The flowers ended up crunchy & crisp surrounding the filling.  Thank you for your entry!
227607,240139,2007-12-14,5,Wow!!!! We loved these.  It was a bonus that I did not have to add eggs.  I did not do the step of adding the coconut to the top...I just added it to the batter.  I tripled the recipe and got 15 medium sized pancakes.  They were gone very quickly.  We had a contest to see which kid(5 of them) could tell me the 2 secret ingredients.  It was great.
54278,37090,2003-05-23,3,"Easy to make. However, I couldn't get a good-sized pocket cut in my chops, so I just butterflied and spread the mixture on top. I sed fresh pureed granny smiths I had in my fridge (that I needed to get rid of) in place of the chopped apples. I also used the fresh juice extracted for the apple juice. I didn't have oranges, so I used lemons. For the breadcrumbs, I used 2-3 toasted slices of low-cal whole-wheat bread grinded in my CuisinArt. We liked the sauce and served it over brown rice. I gave this *** because the flavor seemed to lack something. It seemed fairly bland. Perhaps it was from the lemon/orange substitution (or because I enjoy BIG, pronounced flavors)"
524379,53594,2008-05-03,5,"My wife made this as a snack for the group of elementary aged kids that come to our home after school everyday.  They gobbled it down.  Wonderful recipe.  She used my mothers homemade jam instead of the preserves.  I would agree with other comments though, with the homemade jam, we could have left out the sugar.  Otherwise a wonderful and delicious recipe."
201581,165197,2010-05-17,5,I made this and filled it with Recipe #93777 for a lite healthy dessert. Thanks for posting Miss Rat. Made for Healthy Choices Tag game.
2001107252,49737,2017-01-07,5,So yummy! I followed the other review that suggested adding salsa and omitted cilantro and lemon. Great flavors and a big hit at my house!
368078,418555,2010-08-09,5,"I found this in a magazine years ago, and it has been my favorite ""special"" past recipe since.  It's very rich, but it's easy to make and the flavor is amazing!  Would highly recommend trying this if you haven't already!"
822808,156543,2009-12-23,5,We like these a lot.  Make sure to eat them quickly as they do go bad within a few days!
226863,395613,2009-10-25,5,"Grilled these outside on a charcoal grill, and they turned out delicious.  I put the bacon under the cheese, to keep it from sliding off the burger!  I used Southern Flavor Chargrill Seasoning instead of blackening and mixed it into the meat.  Then I gave an extra toss of black pepper on the outside of the burgers before cooking.  I really wanted a sliced avocado on these, but I didn't have one, but next time.....! I made these for TYM tag."
300721,71373,2006-07-04,5,"I rarely write a review, but I had to write about this recipe.  The rolls turn out perfect every time!  It is easy enough to add herbs or any other variations if desired, but they are delicious just as the recipe is written.  I have a Breadman, and have not had any issues with too sticky dough as some reviewers wrote.  My kids beg for these rolls almost every night!!  Thanks for a winner!"
505183,208237,2009-01-23,5,"I was about to post this recipe myself, but did a quick search to see if it was already out here.  This is a favorite around my house!!  If I'm feeling lazy, I just use tub butter -- spread it on the rolls, then sprinkle with the paprika and garlic powder."
84481,79562,2003-12-28,5,"Most excellent!  There was tons of sauce- I used 6 pork cutlets and could probably have done 8.  To  make sure my kids would try it, I cut back on the curry powder a little- used 4 tsp of Penzeys (fairly potent) and that was perfect for us.  We added some mango ginger chutney on the side.  Overall, a great addition to the repertoire."
168462,43509,2005-04-11,5,"My son who hates any type of fruit said these muffins were fabulous. My DH said these were the best muffins he has ever had, and could not stop eating them. Thank you so much for the recipe."
1728912,362347,2011-01-14,4,This was great!  I marinated my chicken for three hours and they were so moist.  I will definitely make this again but next time I would add a bit of paprika and maybe some chili powder for some heat.
1802602575,129615,2015-02-16,5,Yummy! Also - Try adding a slice of swiss in those layers.
55380,31750,2005-02-24,0,"We decided to rest our tried and true waffle recipe for a day and try a Zaar one. We followed the directions exactly but the results were dismal. It was the first time I've ever had to totally ditch the food. I'm not rating with stars for now because I can't guarantee the problem wasn't on our end, even though we've done similar things a hundred times. I will be trying this one more time, but am out of ingredients today. Thanks for posting, though! "
131126,118866,2007-02-24,5,"Although I didn't make the glaze to top the pound cake I still rate this 5 stars.  Starting with a cake mix made it easy (which I like), it baked up beautifully, and tasted great.  I baked this in two small loaf pans and sliced to serve with fresh fruit and whipped cream for a fast dessert.  I wrapped the second loaf in plastic wrap and it stayed fresh several days.  Thank you for a recipe I will use again."
2000479903,60235,2015-09-16,5,Absolutely yummy great recipe
2874585,485518,2014-09-12,5,This was delicious! Easy to make and really tasted like a supreme pizza! Helps to satisfy the pizza craving. I used hot Italian sausage out of the casing and 2-3 tsp. oregano. Served with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. Always looking for yummy low carb casserole recipes-- this is a good one!
1768411,37336,2013-01-30,4,Loved it and my picky kids all asked for seconds.
593927,99034,2011-08-02,4,"This is yummy!! It just had a slightly eggy taste though and the amount of dressing was too much or too sweet for the amount of fruit and vegtables. I used white vinegar, vindalia onion, fresh sliced strawberries, plus the rest of the ingredients. I might make this again cutting the sugar down a bit and maybe using less dressing."
75218,88794,2004-05-24,5,"This is my new all time favorite for Pineapple Upside Down cakes!  I made it this weekend for a family get together.  It makes a beautiful presentation and tastes even better than it looks!  Oh, I also added 4 T. of butter in the bottom of the bundt pan rather than 2.  It covered the whole round bottom of the pan better and made it more moist.  YUM!!!"
222478,107410,2007-04-20,5,"Mmmm, really good curry that had fantastic flavour and some sweet and sour type characteristics that went together superbly with the duck! Rather than try and dice all the duck I left a lot of it whole like legs, wings etc which I thought added to the presentation.
I like a bit of heat in my curries so used a mix of three small hot fresh chillies, and one of each of a dried habanero, a chipotle and a jalapeno with all the seeds in place. Because of what was available I had to make a few changes, I used standard fresh basil instead of Thai, ginger instead of galangal and because I couldn't find any shrimp paste I dry-fried a handful of prawns (shrimp) for around 15 minutes, sliced and ground with the mortar and pestle. A really great meal served over rice, thanks Jewelies!"
254909,58823,2008-10-21,5,"So simple.
So yummy!
Update: Tonight I made it with twice the garlic and lima beans instead of the white....and it was just as yummy!!!"
193516,211498,2007-03-17,4,"This is a really interesting recipe. The apricot part was very easy to make, and the apricots got soft enough to make a thick, smooth jam like product. When layering the apricot and yogurt I was surprised at how little yogurt and how much apricot there was. I would have prefered a bit yogurt to apricot ratio, but it was yummy this way too. The sugar cinnamon syrup on top gave a nice finishing touch. I served these in individual dishes so the layers wouldn't be wrecked during serving. Reviewed for RSC #9."
383346,297810,2008-04-25,5,"It's very easy to do.  And the sauce smells so good.  And I tasted it only today (it was my lunch).  It's delicious even if it's simple to do.  I used a 28 ounces can of diced plain tomatoes (without sodium).  I added dry thyme, dry basil, and dry oregano.  About 1 teaspoon of each.  I omitted the salt.  This sauce could be great with spaghetti or any other pasta.  Thanks Lainey.  Made for Newest Zaar Tag."
632604,201719,2010-03-31,4,"Pretty good scone recipe. Might reduce the vanilla by half and add fruit or chocolate chips. I used a mini scone pan and actually had enough dough for nine, perhaps ten, scones though I only made eight. Some were a bit think when I bake them. Definitely will make again."
678366,302972,2009-09-29,5,"Wow! Great tip! At first I thought: Come on!How hard can it be to boil eggs?! Then, I remembered my DH, almost accomplish to  burn them once. I like showing off to my friends with these kind of tips (anyway, since I'm on the zaar my dishes are most popular:_wink ) it makes me look as I've been cooking for a longer time than I actually do!"
742173,74048,2009-01-11,0,While making this I couldn't keep my daughters out of the kitchen! I'm not sure how much it will cool before we eat it all but it is absolutely fantastic! Very easy to make and I made it in an oversized pot and found it not messy at all.
291306,182336,2006-09-10,4,"I wanted to try a different rice pudding and I am glad I did this one.  It was sooooo good.  I could have eaten a whole lot more, but I restrained myself! Due to my personal preferences, I left the raisins out.  I like that it cooks in the crockpot--so easy.  Thanks!"
625679,108651,2008-11-11,5,This was great! What wonderful flavor for something so simple. I also added cheese and broccoli.
2330655,90674,2012-08-25,5,perfect recipe im saving it to my favorites.  Thanks
228672,17658,2009-01-05,5,"Quick & easy!  I used the full amount of oil for 1.5 pounds of shrimp.  I also increased the garlic and used half fresh parsley and half dried.  The recipe didn't specify which kind to use.  This shrimp tastes nice and buttery, but with healthier olive oil instead of butter.  Two thumbs up!"
7422,8524,2001-05-21,3,This recipe is simple to make and flavorful but I found the cornchips became very mushy with the liquid on it.  I did add black beans (drained) to add additional color and protein to dish.
327281,133908,2006-09-23,5,"An excellent recipe, which I shall be making again.  Would make a good breakfast for active children - full of eggs and bacon.  The texture was very dense and eggy - I think perhaps my eggs were a bit too large.  Certainly my mixture was so soft that I didn't really need to add any buttermilk (although I added a little, in case it was needed for the rising process).  But the recipe works very well, and I can think of many occasions for which it would be ideal.  I have frozen one loaf."

6863,316,2001-04-18,2,Dolmades just cant be made without avgalimino sauce as it just doesn't have the same flavor.Check out a good recipe and try it you'll see what I mean.
897576,82466,2008-07-20,5,"This. Was. Fabulous. Will definitely be in our rotation again! I was drooling just thinking about the leftovers. We used udon as well since that's what the ""local"" store had."
54067,129926,2008-07-09,5,"Theses were great. Instead of adding chopped green chilies I added about 1/2 c of mild green enchilada sauce to my creamy topping mixture. This made a nice smooth creamy topping with wonderful flavor. This recipe puts the chicken enchiladas to shame at my favorite restaurant, and it is soooo inexpensive to make."
331695,203346,2009-07-30,5,"this is at least made twice a month at my house thank you ! love it as is but some times sub other veggies for the spinach, we like canned artichoke chopped in its place and we use 3 cups of cheese and 2 jars of sauce."

My grandmother used the ""waste not, want not"" saying around our house too!  Thanks for reminding me of her today - Easter.  She always went out of her way to make our holidays so special.  Great memories and great PAC 2010 find!"

50509,59289,2006-09-09,4,"I liked, guest found a bit gloppy and hard to eat (the wimp). I used 6 in. french rolls instead of loaves of bread, and cut down the middle vertically (kind of like a potato) - I thought the filling stayed in better that way. I think the cream cheese spread actually keeps the sauce from soaking in too much into the bread - other sandwiches of this type seem to disintegrate, and this one did not. Before spooning the meatballs in, I also put in a couple of small fresh mozarella balls into the sandwich. The cheese was soft but not runny and it tasted excellent. If you are avoiding meat but eat dairy, I think this could be an excellent cheese sandwich. "
386585,364484,2009-11-16,5,"These really did crisp up very nicely and were full of flavor.  I used 1-1/2 lbs. of thin-sliced chicken breasts and they cooked for 30 minutes.  I did turn them during the cooking process, which gave them a nice, even coating texture.  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game."
27783,53533,2003-02-06,5,"Wow! The dressing on these tomatoes & onions is excellent - tangy and a bit sweet, but not overly so.  I kept saying ""yum"" with every bite.  This was still great the next day as well.  Simple but a burst of flavor in every bite.  Thanks! "

Thanks."
487548,108401,2009-11-02,4,"An interesting dish that tasted quite good.  I did use canola oil instead of peanut oil as I was broiling the fish.  Next time however I will cut the soy sauce in half as the ""light"" soy sauce has 580mg of sodium in each 1 tablespoon (that's 1/16th of a cup).  I also will omit the extra salt the recipe calls for."
126440,507330,2014-01-08,5,Great change of pace for breakfast.  Made it yesterday but put a slice in the microwave for 15 sec. and it was wonderful.
51011,63924,2005-02-27,5,"These are the best!!!  I can probably eat 10 by myself.  It is a bit of work preparing them, but totally worth it.  Great for low-carbing it too.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
768039,337443,2008-12-14,5,"Very nice! This is not as heavy as a lot of similar dips. I used a combination of lite sour cream and light mayo, also increased the garlic a bit. We ate this with baguette slices. After baking I sprinkled some shredded parmesan on top and ran it under the broiler for a minute, then garnished with some reserved asparagus tips.  Thanks for this great app., dka!"

11297,12757,2002-04-29,4,Great way to do these vegies for a change. Thanks for posting. :)
56112,103554,2005-11-23,5,I am always on the lookout for great ways to make boxed mixes taste more like homemade.  DH has a sweet tooth that requires that there always be a cake in the cake plate.  This recipe is just the ticket.  Thanks for the great recipe.
552613,212565,2008-10-28,5,"Sometimes you can just look at a recipe and know you are going to love it and that was exactly the case with this recipe.  I have eyed this up for months and finally gave it a try and boy am I glad I did.  I only made two changes.  The first was to use low fat margarine instead of butter and that worked wonderfully well and cut a lot of fat.  The second was with the green onions.  I don't like raw onions at all.  So, I put them in at the stage where the carrots and orzo were added and they ended up being beautifully done and really added to the taste.  I loved this dish and it will be in my regular rotation.  Made for Cookbook Tag."
495371,13249,2008-05-14,0,Perfect recipe for poached Salmon. I serve it with Sauce Bearnaise and topped with a sprig of fresh Dill and Creamy Mash Potoato on the side in my restaurant. it is our most popular fish dish
124404,5410,2005-03-04,4,"Delectable and delicious!  DH loved it, too, and said it will go perfect with tea/coffee...I gave it four stars only because I never could form it into a big ball, as it really crumbled.  Didn`t affect the taste though. Oh, and I baked it for only 40 minutes as it was already tanish...so I think 1 hr. is way too long. Maybe adjust the oven temp down a little.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
416071,64855,2010-05-07,5,"This literally is the best sangria - especially on hot summer nights. I love how versatile this recipe can be - you can make it with red wine or champagne, and pretty much any fruit combination works (but my favorite is the citrus listed as is). Thanks for sharing!"
1802968828,26110,2017-05-07,5,"This is the second time I've made these and I doubled the recipe. The first time they were good but this time, oh my! They were awesome! I had no buttermilk so I had to use the whole milk and white vinegar trick to substitute. Made sausage gravy and fresh over easy eggs for breakfast ?? to rave reviews!! I'm surprised the biscuits taste so good because there is no sugar in them; I triple checked the recipe wen mixing the dry ingredients to make sure I missed nothing. The cold, sweet butter made a difference I guess."
727685,103085,2008-08-09,5,"I used a third of the recipe and that STILL makes lots of cookies. It's all there: flavor and texture are perfect. The easiest, yummiest cookies I've ever made. Thanks for the newspaper tip, really effective!"
120647,203720,2007-02-01,5,I loved this too!  It was like a margarita that was pink and definitely with more personality!  The fusion liqueur with blood oranges and mango was absolutely delicious... I can't wait for summer and a pool party so that I can serve this.  Thanks for sharing!
201204,26162,2006-09-28,5,"This was DELICIOUS!  I've never had sweet potato bread before, and I'm so glad I found this recipe!  I had a can of sweet potatoes I wanted to use, and this was perfect!  Unfortunately, I didn't have walnuts, but used hazelnuts instead, and it was awesome!  Absolutely wonderful warm with a pat of butter!  Thank you Karen!!"
358796,220770,2007-12-22,4,Good mexi melts. Mine ended up being 4 large rectangles instead of 6 squares. Turned out good. I also used chopped chilies and mixed that with the meat and cheese and salsa before filling. It was easier that way.
1566320,190470,2010-03-01,0,These was awful and disgusting. My 4 year baby spits them out and cried. They are Hot and Spicy and no good for kids.
677645,96499,2008-01-01,5,This was great. I even got my son to eat some.  You were right the kraut was not nearly as tart. So easy to. Thanks for sharing!!!!
130819,24156,2006-08-05,5,"This review is long overdue! I can't believe how good these carrots are! They are great fresh as well as made ahead and reheated. What more could one ask for vegetable side dish that everyone loves! So glad I noted the reviews on this one as I am not sure I would have given that combination a try! Thank you, love these tangy carrots."
383346,334090,2009-01-01,5,This drink was great.  I wanted something quiet (no shaker involved).  And I was lazy also LOL  This is very good.  Thanks BarefootMomma.  Made for 123 hit wonders
870346,71557,2008-09-02,4,"I thought this recipe was very delicious. Easy to make and went well with some fresh steamed veggies. My boyfriend wasn't crazy about it and said it was just ""ok"" but I thought it was a nice dinner for a weeknight."
29956,25282,2003-10-16,5,"Lots of good flavours, subtle but very tasty. Thanks."
482849,352435,2009-01-27,5,This is a really yummy recipe.  I make one that is just in a casserole dish with exactly the same ingredients and it is delish!!  So glad to find it for a crockpot because this will make dinner even easier for me when I get home from work or church!  Don't pass this recipe up -- it's well worth it!!!
924480,81834,2010-01-04,5,A favorite! I make a batch and freeze 1/2 for another day. My kids are always asking for this meal.

139894,77312,2004-12-05,5,"EXCELLENT salad!  It made about twice as much dressing as needed, but that was great since I used it for other salads.  I used pecans and walnut oil.  "
271618,110496,2008-01-04,5,"This was awesome. So very delicious. The only change I made was that for the 2 cups of cheese, I used mostly mozzarella and the rest cheddar-jack. (We do NOT like cheddar with our eggs!!!) My problem, however, was that it didn't set up in the center. I had to crank the temperature and leave it in for quite a bit longer. Next time (and oh yes there will be a next time), I'll crank the heat up to 400 or 425. I even tried pulling it out after 30 minutes and nuked it for a minute in the microwave, but that just made the cheese bubble out from the inside,like some crazy model of the earth and the cheese was lava...so back in the oven it went, with the heat cranked up, for about maybe 7 more minutes. Really tasty with some Frank's Red Hot Sauce sprinkled on top. I served it with hashbrowns, the frozen kind in a bag that are cubes, ""western"" style. Very very tasty!"
226145,325257,2009-12-19,5,"This turned out just fantastic!  Although I started out beating with a wooden spoon, I soon got out the hand mixer and beat on low till it lost it's gloss.  It goes FAST when it starts to set up!  I ended up patting it into my pan. LOL!  Tastes great!  Very smooth and creamy.  Winner!"
424680,311157,2009-06-16,5,"OH, YES ~ ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL & this keeper of a recipe is gonna be made again & again this summer! Loved everything about this one, from prep to the pinks & reds to the wonderful taste! Did something I've never done before in that the pastry that I used extended over the edge a bit more than I'd originally wanted. However, instead of cutting it back, I left it that way while carefully baking it, THEN when I cut it back, it crumbled into all sizes of pieces! When the pie was finished, I sprinkled some of that crumbed pastry over the top (just for something different) & I liked the rustic look! Anyway, 2Bleu, THIS IS A GREAT, GREAT PIE ~ Thanks for sharing it! [Tagged, made & reviewed in Please Review My Recipe["
1149592,319247,2013-03-04,5,I can't believe that no one has reviewed this recipe.  It is definitely a 5 star.  So easy and so good.  I did cook the marinade down and serve as a sauce.  This is company worthy.  Not only delicious but makes a beautiful presentation when sliced thick and served with grilled onions and sauce.  A real keeper.  I will use this recipe often.  Thanks for sharing Chris.
74732,85076,2007-05-14,5,"Just made these quickly this morning to send with my kids on their lunch!  They turned out great!  Subtle flavor, not too sweet and made a little healthier by the addition of some wheat germ (1/4 cup) and ground flax seed (1/4 cup)."
276323,104084,2008-11-10,5,I've been eating these for years!  YUMMY!  Thanks for spreading the love to the Zaar world :)  Everyone should try this just once!
991523,95239,2011-09-08,5,I have to agree with you Anchor girl OMG!  The sauce was great it had so much flavor.  I froze the left over to use on pasta.  It was on the sweeter side and I did cut back to 1/2 cup sugar but I thought it was perfect!  Great dish when it was all done.  Thanks again!
36890,146579,2006-03-07,5,"Very good.  Very easy!
I'll make this again!"

You MUST dip a crisp crouton in the runny egg yolk....heavenly.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  I need to make it again since I forgot your photo!  Made for French Food & Foto Fun.  :)"
133174,460368,2013-07-16,5,This was made pretty much as written.  We have some wonderful kabob baskets and there was enough ingredients to fill 4 which is equivalent to the skewers called for in the recipe.  This made an excellent dinner served with Recipe #427739 and Recipe #503616.  Made for ZWT9.
90838,151911,2007-12-31,5,"Easy and inexpensive to make.  Very fun for the kids.  I don't store mine in individual containers, my kids have to measure out what they need. LOL  I love the convenience of a mix rather than trying to make individual batches."
197319,27210,2009-01-18,0,"Had very little prep time available, so thought I would try this recipe. Marinated pork for only 1hr. Had to use Emeril's Essence since I had no lemon pepper seasoning, and it goes with everything, right? It was a hit in my home w/ very little marinating time. Will definitely use this recipe again w/ longer marinating time & lemon pepper seasoning. Thanks for the recipe!"
34173,20866,2002-07-09,5,"We weren't (sorry that is!) The onions done this way were a perfect topping for the burgers at our Canada Day cookout.  No other condiment was necessary; in fact several people specifically commented what a nice change it was from the mustard, relish & ketchup route. I made up the onions the night before and all that was required at serving time was a few seconds in the microwave.  Very easy, very effective.
Thank you"
125388,99322,2008-07-06,5,"We are trying to eat more vegetables, and I'm glad we tried this recipe.  DH and I both enjoyed this one.  DH (the veggie-hater) even went back for seconds.  I diced the bacon instead of cutting in half because I didn't want big pieces of bacon."
485109,330274,2009-12-10,5,What a way to jazz up leftovers! I really liked the alfalfa sprouts (I believe it's the same as what we call cress) as they gave a nice texture alongside the creamy cheese. Thanks breezermom!
61712,30209,2002-11-29,5,I have been looking for a recipe that produces the kind of BBQ turkey drumsticks that they serve at the Fall festivals around here. I actually like the way these drumsticks turned out better than the ones I have tried before. The one thing I did a little different was to make 2 batches of the marinade. I am funny about using  marinade that poultry has been soaking in to also cook with. So I had a fresh batch to put in the foil pouches and baste with. The meat was tender and not hard to pull of the bone. Great flavor. Thanks Nurse Di for sharing this recipe.
1638434,144837,2017-12-19,5,Iâve made this several times and my family loves it! Especially my son and daughter-in-law. Itâs their go to comfort food soup.
833427,411571,2011-03-07,0,I made this recipe and was greatly disappointed. It had a raw and a chalky taste to it. I will not try this one again
351959,130939,2006-09-12,5,"Very easy and good!! I have made this twice for my family.  We like spicy food so I even added a little more red pepper sauce.  The creamy texture of the grilled potatoes helps to balance the ""heat"" of the sauce.  If you do not like bleu cheese, ranch dressing or even sour cream is a nice addition."
182330,132075,2008-12-31,5,I was remiss in rating this recipe.  I have made it many times and it is always gone quickly.  People hover when they know it's coming.  lol
2002230274,500856,2018-07-27,3,"Well they're the tenderest ribs I've ever done. But definitely need to cut crock pot time to about 3.5 hours . Will try again tomorrow and see how that works. Facebook rest batch literally just pork meat because the bones fell out as I removed from crock pot after 5 hours. So again the others are right, delicious recipe timing is a little tricky."
199633,26423,2005-06-17,5,The recipe worked well. I added a half tsp. salt to give it a lift in flavor.
111384,49166,2005-05-01,5,"This recipe is awesome, just one word really fresh sprouts is really the way to go, for me anyway.It's simply not the same without it.It's crispier and really more appetizing.This is one recipe that you can add anything you like , I like to add brocalli,at the very end, to make sure it's a nice green color.Nothing spoils it more than over cooked,I like all vegetables all-dante,I think it's really important to add veggies at the very end.Spices also makes it extra special like,ginger curry,turmeric give a nice color and very healthy too.So that's it you got something healthy and colorful all at the same time...Keep up the good cooking!!!"
909143,205873,2010-06-22,5,"Great recipe! Easy, quick, and most of these things can be found in your pantry- no need to run to the store. I used olive oil instead of canola oil, and added some Tabasco to the beans and corn. Thanks for the delicious recipe! Will make this again for sure."
174711,16273,2008-10-30,5,"Excellent! I did pound the daylights out of the meat before browning it and after almost 2 hours, it was absolutely delicious and fall apart tender. Next time I think I may use more wine but there will certainly be a next time.
Thanks for posting."
500860,166212,2007-06-09,5,"OMG!!!! This is IT! This is Indian food that even my hubby (who does not do spicy) can eat without trepidation. My two year old DEMANDED her own bowl and didn't get down from the table until it was fingerlicking clean! And that is WAY out of character for her.

Okay. So I had a favorite Indian restaurant in the San Francisco Bay Area, and they would make me this special dish called a fish vindaloo. Wasn't even on their menu. This ""gravy"" reminded me of that vindaloo. I like that this is vegan, for those kosher cookers this can be eaten at either a dairy or a meat meal. And it is a good base to play with. I always wondered ""how they did that"".

THe vindaloo that I used to eat was often cooked with pieces of whitefish and potatoes and MORE gravy (so next time I will double the amount of liquid and the seasonings and just add chunks of potato and maybe some steamed fish).

This is a WOW WOW WOW YOWZER WOW dish all the way. I have reviewed a LOT of recipes, but this one may have been one of my favorites to date. 

Delicious. Nutricious. Screaming of India (I don't know Tanzinian cuisine) but not too spicy. Serve over brown rice or with Naan (recipes for this bread can be found on the Zaar, though I've never made it myself, but hear it is relatively easy to make).

Wonderful. Thank you!!!"
1061706,31321,2008-12-08,0,I live near the jello plant and know people who worked there. This is basically what they told me to do to replicate the original
347595,83141,2009-11-26,5,"Thanks for posting this. Here""s what I do a little different. The amount of topping will vary with your pan of choice, I use a gratin pan so as to get more streusel. More topping the better in my opinion with just three inches of sweet potatoes beneath. If you boil your sweet potatotos with a quartered orange, 1 t salt, and half cup of brown sugar, you shouldnt need any sugar in the sweet potato mixture. I add 1/2 cup of cream and reduce the butter in the sweet potato mixture and only use one egg. I also forgo the vanilla but thats just because I cant tell the difference when its there or no. If they still seem dry, you can add some of the cooking liquid which is rich and flavorful. Really 1 t of salt is also needed in the bottom layer to bring out the flavors of the potatos, IMO. Personally I also like a little msg along with the salt. It rounds the flavor and enhances the overall quality of the dish."
340141,123999,2006-08-24,4,"This is plain tasting, but SO comforting and satisfying.  I want to go back for a second bowl!  The brown rice took the full 30 minutes to cook, and even then I left the lid on and the pot on the burner (heat off) for about 5 minutes.  It was just barely done.  It was an extremely easy to make dish, however.  

I used real bacon, and I think that was wonderful--the flavor, less salty than bacon bits, and biting into chunks of it ocasionally was wonderful.  I had to put shredded cheddar on top it to convince DH it was a meal in itself.  UPDATED TO ADD:  I did have to go back for a second bowl.  Yummy."
107504,42082,2003-10-10,5,People will be attracted to the aroma while it's baking.  My husband loved this recipe.
599482,103799,2008-02-21,4,"Really enjoyed this - even better the second day after flavors melded.  Great way to use up those leftover bits of roast, etc."
362787,32204,2007-02-21,5,"THE BEST!!!  I was looking for a outstanding brownie recipe and I found it!!!  I doubled the recipe and it worked great.  I used half butter and half margarine to cut a few calories. :-)  I added crumbled up hershey bars and used half ""dark"" chocolate cocoa along with half regular cocoa, this made them very dark and very good.  Thanks Karen for a winner!"
208389,67664,2005-08-08,4,"In the words of a 3 and a half year old ""Mmmm, this is yummy, Mommy!"" I agree. I used OJ, and the taste was a bit overpowering for me so I may try a different juice concentrate next time or reduce it from 3/4 to 1/2 cup. I also added a 1/2 cup of frozen raspberries for colour and added flavour, which I added after everything else was mixed and just pulsed a few times so the pieces didn't get too small. Thanks for a great, versatile recipe!"

11176,69213,2006-07-18,5,"The lightest, most devine fish batter I've ever had.  How do you DO that, Kitten? I used orange roughy cut into pieces with the seasoned salt. Forgot to beat the egg white (oops!), but it was still perfect.  Straight into my Encore cookbook, thank you yet again! "
543029,74805,2008-08-05,5,"Perfect! I had some chocolate covered strawberries, a pint of whipping cream, and some French Vanilla instant pudding mix so I decided to whip this up. Divine!

428885,427781,2010-06-13,5,"Wow, loved this little salad, and really loved the harissa in it. I used all the ingredients listed, and I thought the feta was a nice touch. It gave it a nice salty bite and that is what I really liked a lot. YUM, the mint gave it a nice subtle background and wouldn't leave this out at all. All and all a great dish! Made for ZWT6 Zee Zesties!"
169430,295001,2008-11-18,5,This is a lovely quick muffin that can be adapted to so many additions that it might be called universal. I chose the oatmeal cinnamon version given but swapped out the raisins for diced apple and to increase the health factor (not that they are bad to start with!) I used 1 cup whole wheat flour/1/4 cup unbleached all purpose. Splenda replaced the sugar. I used skim milk and egg white. Thank you very much Hokies for a great for this great find :D. Made for 1-2-3 Tag.
123897,79278,2005-01-08,5,I used fine sugar but I'm sure coarse sugar would be good if needs be. I also used peppermint flavouring and a plastic bag.

383346,218857,2008-06-10,5,This was amazing.  I sliced mozzarella and covered all the beef patties.  I used my spaghetti sauce.  And I didn't measure for the parmesan.  1/4 cup of breadcrumbs was enough.  The seasoning in the patties were perfect for me.  The sauce and the cheese added to the patties made this dish so wonderful.  Thanks Julie.  Made for ZWT4
768828,78953,2008-11-20,5,"I really liked this, but cheated a little.  I was short on time so cooked the potatos in the microwave and then added the rest of the ingredients and reheated a little.   Oh I also used Splenda brown sugar as we are trying to cut our sugar intake.  Thanks for such a good recipe"
402559,15411,2008-12-27,5,These were a great addition to our Santa cookie plate and a HUGE time saver. Thanks!
129958,79768,2004-10-06,3,"I made this dip according to the recipe.  The only exception was that I had to use another brand of alfredo sauce.  I did not care for the flavor, but DH said it was okay.  I do hope someone else will try this recipe though.  I am sure it will be delicous to someone else.  It is very easy to make and makes a good amount.  Thanks for you contribution to Zaar, kuntryqtpi!"
55578,120374,2007-06-04,5,"Great recipe BecR!!!  I added about 1/4 c of salsa into it.  DS said 5 stars Mom, not 4 1/2!!"
448004,183866,2012-04-11,5,Loved it!!! I will be making this again.  :)
280813,129905,2006-10-31,5,I make this often for work as its easy to grab when we have a minute but to make it easier to transport and eat I mix the softened cream cheese with the jelly and blend on low with the hand mixer for a minute....fabulous and easy.
140132,31750,2008-02-21,5,"We love waffles on Sunday mornings.  (who am I kidding, we love them ALL the time...lol)  I made these and they turned out perfect, crisp outside and soft inside....delicious.  thank you for posting....Stephanie"
162775,59772,2006-12-03,5,"A very good place to start.  I tripled the recipe and added a little bit more chili powder than indicated.  I used mostly honey but added a little brown sugar. I also put in a dash of liquid smoke, apple cider vinegar and some ground black pepper.  My husband and I don't like it too sweet so I added 8 ounces of canned tomato sauce.  It was very tasty but still a bit too sweet so next time I'll add less honey/sugar.  I used this with the Recipe Zaar recipe ""Barbecue Chicken Roll-ups."""
2001838246,80156,2017-12-17,1,Easy to make but tasted yuck ???? molass was way too strong.
115621,46797,2004-07-18,5,"I love soup and this was absolutely delicious. I could eat it winter, summer, spring and fall. It was so tasty with the swiss cheese. It gave it a nice mild flavor. I ate it with a nice crusty buttery toast. Shame on me...but sooo goood!"
142361,234870,2007-07-09,5,"I'm always on the prowl for new and interesting ways to enjoy salmon and this one really took the cake. The vinaigrette was the perfect balance between fruity acidic and savory fats with flavor. A huge compliment to the salad. The colors were beautiful and the flavor of the fish was phenominal. I will be making this many times, which is a huge compliment coming from me because I'm NOT a jerk fan. Great job, <b>Kitchen Tourists</b>!"
1164341,233359,2009-03-24,5,"WOW !  This was sooo good, I couldn't get enough! Followed recipe exactly except I used cabbage and romaine lettuce and topped it with some LaChoy chow mein noodles.  I had leftovers and made a wrap with it and that too was fabulous!  I will definately be making this alot."
369715,137188,2007-11-18,5,These were really good and easy to make. I liked them too because it was something different. Will be making again.
125325,7417,2004-07-23,5,I don't know why I haven't reviewed this yet. I have made them so many times and have not bought tortillas since I found this recipe. Thank you so much.
2001201474,443758,2016-11-04,5,165 is the correct temperature for poultry.
185059,8673,2005-11-03,5,"I thought this was wonderful!  I did use fresh potatoes and just added them to the soup.  It was great!  I also put a little cheese on top.  So yummy!  This one is a keeper!
Thansk!"
599141,251131,2007-09-27,4,"This was great - a wonderful blend of sweet and savory, which is something that black beans lend themselves to so well.  Using canned beans made the recipe quick and easy to put together.  I substituted green onions and jarred roasted red bell peppers for their recipe counterparts, and put in a pinch of crushed red pepper for a little spice.  I didn't do much measuring, and used a potato masher instead of a blender just enough to mush up some of the beans, so mine came out a little chunkier.  I wanted the kids to be able to use it as a dip with chips, but they didn't like it.  More for me!!"
140806,89204,2004-10-01,5,"This recipe is delightful-and so simple! I started this dish on my lunch break and when I came home from work, the house was filled with a wonderful aroma. I strongly suggest using regular cream cheese at room temperature, not low fat or fat free. The chicken turned out so tender. This meal has instantly become a favorite. I served it with brown rice."
949928,76139,2008-09-09,5,"These are a perfect soup partner. Soft enough to tear, but nice and spongy for dipping. They have just enough flavor, but I prefer them to be a little mellow as they're best soaked in a delicious soup."
98165,126623,2009-10-20,5,Holy cow I LOVED this!  It reminded me of something I used to make when I was younger and still at home with my parents.  Definetely a comfort food.  I used turkey smoked sausage;)
1989239,429472,2011-08-23,5,Totally awesome cake.  I didn't top with apples but put them as a layer in the middle of the cake batter.  Very moist and spicy and very hard to walk past without having a slice!
109983,19055,2004-11-24,5,This is yummy!  I made this last year for Thanksgiving and now is my husbands most requested pie recipe!  This one is definitely a tradition starter.  It could use telling how hot to bake the filled pie shell at though.
219318,365777,2010-05-25,4,"Made this exactly as stated.  My oven put the bottom of the pan at 8"" from the heat, and the salmon cooked at about 10 minutes per inch thickness.  We really liked the way the top developed a crust.  Made for ZWT6--Whine and Cheese."
41738,8782,2003-10-13,5,Excellent!  The recipe already has 38 reviews what more could I add except it was easy and the chicken came out moist and the spice taste was very good.  This is my second time making this recipe and I will be making it many more.  Thanks.
2001466150,438869,2017-04-01,0,Love them and if and the fridgerator it'll be even harder but it's good I watch them make it one time I'm going to work that just got off 240 and Penn in OKC so it's really awesome and really good
1802849661,161042,2016-10-14,5,"What a wonderfully moist cake! I've thought about making a sweet potato cake for a while, but wasn't sure what to expect, so put it off. I'm so glad I finally got round to it; this cake is lovely and spicy and the sweet potato adds the most amazing earthy sweetness. Just beautiful!"
173314,94336,2007-10-31,5,Everyone loved this. We served over egg noodles.  Didn't look pretty but tasted delicious.
340141,508040,2013-11-21,5,"The best black bean dish I&#039;ve ever had.   Black beans aren&#039;t a favorite of mine, but you&#039;d never know it from how delicious this dish turned out.   It was smoky and savory; the orange juice and particularly zest really lifted it above the ordinary bean soup."
1831515,194043,2011-02-18,5,"Delicious, do not attempt with plain rice though no matter how good this sounds."
340141,149929,2006-09-22,4,"Excellent, even without the caraway seeds.  I love the way the brown sugar and basil mellowed out the flavor of the sauerkraut.  Prep is very easy NOTE:  if you alot of leftovers, try melting some swiss cheese over the top of it for a change of pace.  DH loved it with slices of 2% Kraft Swiss Cheese slices over it."
552613,181051,2008-06-20,5,This was very good.  It was powerful in taste without being blow my mind off sharp which can sometimes happen with me and cocktail sauce since I am a spice wimp.  I used sweet chili sauce because it was what I had and it worked great.  I had it for lunch with some cooked cold shrimp and I have some more left over for later on.  Made for ZWT4.
875616,267571,2009-04-12,0,"not as sweet, but just as rich.  first time trying, but won't be the last time serving it!  I do need to keep in mind to scrape bowl closer to get all the cream cheese."
318262,181143,2013-06-30,4,I initially found this a bit bland (perhaps it was my brand of cream cheese?) But after adding in a ton of spices and parmesan it really came to life
573905,12975,2009-03-25,5,These were really good and easy.  I was surprised there was not any bread or actual muffin but still very good and easy to make.
111678,332422,2008-11-01,5,"I love these!  I went ahead and added 1/2 tsp of salt in with the chipotle and cinnamon.  This seasoning blend just complements--no, enhances--the sweet potatoes perfectly.  I'm trying to eat healthier, and this is going to become a regular substitute for fries or chips around here.  Thanks!"
835092,281807,2009-01-12,5,"I ADORE this recipe! It does end up with too little liquid at the end, so either enjoy it thick or add more water. I make this without the celery because my husband doesn't like celery, and I use 2 bay leaves, and 1 dash (make sure you don't use any more than one shake of the shaker) of allspice (haven't tried it with cloves).  I ALSO make this with russet potatoes because I don't like red potatoes in a stew, they make everything taste sour.  LOVE it."
2001544480,267953,2017-07-16,5,"I made it just like. Served it to my friends for dinner and they ended taking what ever was left. You have to try this recipe if you like squash, you won't be able to stop dipping into it Definitely will make again............ soon!"
645907,72654,2008-01-24,5,made this at Christmas 2007. Everyone loved it! I made it as a side dish to spoon on the ham if desired.
121757,30212,2004-07-15,2,much easier to use premade mix.  Had to add liquid for it wouldn't blend.
208631,36634,2013-09-28,5,"Very easy, very tasty. Used what I had onhand. So replaced the heavy cream and milk with half &amp; half, and used pepper jack for the cheese. Worked just fine for me. I also added 5 minutes to the chicken baking time before adding sauce, and another additional 5 minutes after adding the sauce and cheese.... looked like it needed it. As always, a recipe is a suggestion and you modify a bit here and there as your experience and tastebuds allow..... and this recipe is a GREAT suggestion!"
1271713,187843,2009-12-18,4,This was so good and rich. makes a lot of food.
192581,61851,2006-03-29,5,"This has been in one of my cookbooks since I first joined Recipezaar and I'm glad I finally made it.  I sauteed the vegetables for about 5 minutes, wrapped the filling in flour tortillas instead of tacos and topped it with tomatoes, cilantro, scallions, regular cheddar cheese, low-fat yogurt, black olives and hot sauce. Easy recipe, and filling doesn't make a mess while eating.  Thanks!"
286566,94211,2007-08-30,5,I wouldn't believe it unless I had made it. Next time I will up the soy by another tablespoon. Other than that in the last 4 minutes I added some chopped up prawn and beanshoots and stirred. I have a 900w oven and the 20 minutes was right for it.
56495,32833,2009-08-13,5,This dish is sooo easy and delicious! I have made it many times and everyone always loves it!! Definite keeper.
482376,3470,2007-10-04,5,"Delish! It was very easy to put together and the outcome was pure comfort. Nothing fancy, just that good ol' comfort food taste. I used provolone cheese, since I don't care for swiss. It was great. Thanks!"
1762446,32668,2011-08-15,0,I just made these & they really are very good. Mine were a little dry so I cooked my 2nd batch a couple of minutes less made it 19mins I haven't tried them yet but I will let you know
369715,213785,2008-10-16,5,Loved this soup! I am a huge soup fan and love taco soup. I thought I would give this recipe a try as I had two cans of chili beans I wanted to use up. I followed the recipe as written other then I didn't add one can of beans and didn't add the green chilies. I also used Recipe #166030 for the taco seasoning as I don't buy taco seasoning packets anymore. I froze some of this so I would have it for future lunches. This had the perfect seasoning for me. Will be making again.
738763,34499,2008-08-21,5,"Pork chops are a favorite white meat around here and I am always looking for new recipes to make them, so when I ran across this recipe I just knew we would love it and we did!  Loved every bite!  Thanks for posting this for us Yooper!  Don"
984735,240767,2008-10-10,1,I'm Brazilian and I have eaten and made brazilian flan my whole like and this is a really weird recipe.  I have heard of coconut but it's not commonly used but I have NEVER heard of parmesan cheese... that sounds gross.
228458,211225,2008-09-03,5,"This is absolutely a gem. What a terrific post! It is a unique way to enjoy a wonderful under-sung veggie in a way that doesn't pretend it is a potato :). I, too, only used one egg and it seemed to be plenty. My method made this quick and easy enough for any weeknight: I eschewed all dredging and just stirred the egg and cauliflower together to coat, then put it into a container with the ""breading,"" covered, and shook it up until all was coated. Quick, easy, and it worked like a charm! Thanks so much for posting this--it is absolutely a keeper."
107135,369399,2013-07-31,5,loved this recipe  try this one zwt9
118065,21320,2014-04-15,5,This was huge hit! Perfect!!&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for sharing!!
1628676,200728,2012-01-05,0,"This was wonderful! Even hubby who doesn't like eggplant liked it (don't know if he even realized it was eggplant - never told him what was in it). I used half as much cheese - part lowfat, part fat free & a couple slices of processed American cheese."
402065,196504,2007-11-13,5,"This is THE perfect cookie!  Crispy yet chewy at the same time.  So easy to make that my 3 year old does most of the work.  I did make a few modifications to suit my family's tastes.  I subbed 1/4 wheat germ for 1/4 c of flour, as I do in most recipes.  I only used 1/2 c of white sugar.  Instead of 1 1/2 t cinnamon I used 1 t cinnamon and 1/2 t nutmeg.  I did not use the nuts and used 1 1/3 c of raisins."
2480584,107869,2013-05-03,5,"I made this once and did not save it to my cookbook. Big mistake lol. My husband gobbled this up and I spent a good deal of time trying to remember where I found the recipe. As for wrapping it up and eating it later, it literally gets better. We cut into it early and it was good but the next day it was so much more delicious."
544373,45680,2009-07-02,5,"Great recipe!  I had to throw together a bareque for some unexpected visitors tonight.  I used regular mayo and garlic pepper salt in place of the fat free mayo and the fresh garlic since that is what I had on hand.  I had absolutely no problems whisking it together nice and smooth.  But in defense of the other reviews I have had problems whisking fat free mayo with vinegar and/or lemon juice before to where it comes out ""coddled"" looking.  I think it has to do with the way the mayo is prepared.  I mixed the dressing together in one tupperware container, added the cucumber chunks, popped on the lid (made sure it was on good and tight) and then handed it to my granddaughter who had a blast shaking the salad to mix it all up.  In the fridge it went while I prepared my marinade for the chicken.  It really helped my dinner go smoothly with wonderful compliments.  Thank you so much for this recipe."
58836,90674,2007-10-14,5,"Made this yesterday for breakfast.  Didn't have any texas thick bread, only regular but it was just as tasty.  It was just me so I scaled it down to one serving.  Thanks, I'm sure I'll make again."
107583,184228,2010-04-18,5,"Delicious!  My pastry shells didn't cook quite right (they were lopsided) but that didn't detract from the flavor of the filling!  I am looking forward to making these again with fresh tarragon.  I also think mushrooms would be good, subbed for the chicken.  Made for Spring 2010 PAC."
50445,24672,2002-08-15,5,"If there were 6 stars, that's what we'd give!!This was very cool and refreshing, light and flavorful!!!I made it exactly as described, I may add a touch more Cool Whip next time. This was just a test recipe tonight, for my family's gathering next week, I may have to triple it."
66983,37846,2003-04-15,5,"Wow were these good.  Sinfully good.  Blew my Weight Watchers points for the day, but BOY were they worth it!!!!  Sent some to my Gramps who loves nuts and carmel!  Thanks for another yummy pecan recipe!!`"
1740202,74620,2010-11-23,0,"OMG Ladies, simply brown your crust. Get a store bought crust or your choice put a few beans at the bottom if you prefer for weights (toss when finished) as it may bubble a little and cover the edges with thin strips of foil. Just the edges, no it wont fit perfectly but it is necessary so the edges wont overcook because remember you still have to bake the pie so this browning process isn't extremely long, maybe 15min. or a bit longer but not too long, set your timer so you wont over do it to 10min. & gage it from there. Allow it to cool a few min. the foil needs to remain on the edges during the baking process as well or simply replace them if they fall off then bake your pie. 10min before the pie is ready check your crust if you need to remove the foil if it still isn't brown enough but I doubt you will have that issue, leave it on. This is the way my grandmother taught me to bake all pies to ensure you don't end up with a messy crust or burnt edges... ENJOY"
222696,113949,2005-12-28,5,"These are the most amazing cookies...ever. They look beautiful, but that's nothing compared to the taste! Yum! My mom can't stop raving about them. I can certainly see why they're your favorite cookies! Thanks so much for sharing this star of a recipe. :) "
541422,251114,2007-10-08,4,"This was really nice, and it was so quick to put together!  We like a lot of dressing, so I'd probably double that portion next time and maybe add still more red pepper.  Great salad for a summer meal!  Thanks!"
508275,28148,2008-04-17,5,"soooo good! I made these for a Bible study group and everybody really enjoyed them. I sauteed some bell pepper and regular onion (instead of green onions) together before mixing everything together. I guess I used bigger tortillas, because I used closer to 1/2 C per tortilla and fewer tortillas. Oh yeah, I also added some cilatro to the mix too. Thanks for a great recipe! ~"
1187622,429022,2010-06-21,4,A great simple way to prepare chicken.   At the last minute I threw this together and actually prepared on stove top cause I didn't have an hour to bake and it still turned out great using boneless chicken but think the oven is the way to go.   My son loved it and even asked for 2nds which never happens!  Thanks for posting.
236783,8782,2005-08-17,1,"I was uncomfortable with the low cooking temperature and went to http://www.fsis.usda.gov just to make sure it was safe. There is a pull down at the top of the page âfact sheetsâ that says the safe temperature for chicken is 350!! I called the toll free number (888-MP hotline) and was told that it is very unsafe to cook chicken or turkey this way, because it gives bacteria time to multiply while it is reaching the safe internal temp of 180. 
I went ahead and cooked the chicken at the safe temperature of 350 and it was wonderful, but I am concerned about someone getting sick.
"
405691,208645,2007-10-30,3,"I think it was ok- unfortunately I think it was way too dense for my tastes. I like cake to be light and moist, this had more of a thick bread consistency. Probably won't make it again."
206722,137899,2006-06-28,0,"My daughter made this tonight.  I am not going to rate, because she didn't follow directions completely.  However, this marinade made the chicken turn a really unappealing purple color."
131126,179839,2010-05-24,5,Lovely & very flavorful!  The heat was nicely contrasted with the sesame oil & tang from the vinegar.  Served with Recipe #228854 for ZWT6~Asia.
839452,123,2010-05-25,5,"I was chosen to make something special to bring into work for the boss' retirement party, so I chose this.  I got rave reviews and lots of compliments on this and when I finally grabbed a piece, I could see what they were talking about.  It was amazing!  I did chop some nuts in the blender and add them to the crust before making it.  Truly enjoyed!"
1026032,275431,2009-12-12,1,"This doesnt tell you how long to cook it, only when to put in the macaroni"
137157,41218,2005-01-28,5,Excellent recipe. I topped mine with some cooked/chilled cocktail shrimp & sour cream. YUM!
993604,227543,2009-02-03,5,"I have a similar recipe, differences are as follows: calls for only a pinch of sugar, 1 1/2 t. salt, and 2 1/2 - 3 cups all-purpose flour. I found the recipe on Food Network, Emeril Lagasse. Serves as an excellent base for a Mexican pizza.  For a Mexican pizza, spread refried beans over crust rather than tomato sauce. Top with taco meat, cheddar cheese, chopped tomatoes and onion, shredded lettuce, etc."
672534,292151,2011-08-23,4,"I really enjoyed this pie, but as others have stated the filling was too sweet.  I followed the recipe as written, but must have done something wrong, as there was a lot of watery liquid on top of the filling below the meringue after it cooled.   I'm wondering if maybe the filling was cooked too long?  (3 minutes seemed long to me.)  I made two crusts, so I will probably try again with the second crust and use Splenda instead of sugar, also reducing the amount to 1 cup.  Otherwise, the flavor was wonderful, and the meringue was great too!<br/><br/>Note:  After another attempt from a different recipe I had at home, I can say the most important thing here is to have the filling at a full boil before putting on the meringue.  Also, bake the meringue at 325F for 20 min. and you should get better results.  The other recipe cooked the cornstarch with a little water before adding it to the egg whites, and I liked that flavor better."
286566,232105,2009-03-03,5,"My 4 racks had either 4 or 5 chops on them and to well done took th hour but were still beautifully moist (even though I had cut a huge amount of fat of the racks).  After pan frying to brown I allowed just over 1 teaspoon of minced garlic per rack  and sprinkled over the freshly ground pepper and grinded a little salt before roasting in a 175C fan forced oven.  Thank you Tisme, DH has requested to be made again, made for Aussie Recipe Swap #26 March 2009 as a recipextra for group 4 Beetroot."
383346,431932,2010-07-25,5,This is so yummy.  Sweet and spicy.  But it was more spicy than sweet.  I loved it.  Thanks Gailanng :)  Made for Potluck tag game
10033,9953,2006-03-11,5,"These were terrific! I used my food processor to grind my (fake, sorry) crabmeat and the texture came out very well for these. Loved the flavoring, too; however, since I was out of  turmeric, I used some hot curry powder in place of it. I just loved the slight south-asian kick to these! And they were great in the oven. We ate them with some sweet and sour sauce and some spicy/sweet soy sauce. I froze well over half the batch. Thanks for a wonderful recipe! "
373020,484966,2013-08-21,5,"These are AMAZING - 10 stars!  It&#039;s like Baklava without the pastry and honey syrup.  I cooked mine a touch extra and let them cool in the pan.  I exercise every day and am always looking for a healthy, high protein snacks without egg (not easy).  Cannot recommend these enough and what is best is, my kids school is nut free so these babies are mine!  Thanks for posting Little Woman these are a winner!  I might even post this recipe up on the gym members board."
2000759413,271920,2015-12-20,1,"I grew up eating at the Northwoods Inn.  I made this recipe exactly as written.  It&#039;s way too oily and too salty.  I don&#039;t think it is anything like the Northwoods Inn cabbage salad. If this is the recipe they actually gave out, I think they are pulling the wool over people&#039;s eyes."
36944,14305,2002-09-02,4,"This corn has a wonderful velvety texture.  The next time I make this I will make my ""pinch"" of cayenne pepper more generous as I think I was a bit stingy with it!"
131126,435471,2011-07-10,5,"I saw this recipe in a back issue of the Food Network magazine so looked for it on site to post a review.  I was pleasantly suprised at how much flavor the meatballs offered.  The caesar flavor really does come thru.  I made 16 meatballs and threaded four skewers with sweet onions & button mushrooms and cooked on an indoor contact grill. I used the skewers to top a main dish salad of romaine & veggies, but the meatballs would be terrific in a pita.   Served with Recipe #221299."
51527,20600,2002-08-08,4,"We liked this a lot, but next time, I think I'll use more barbeque sauce, and a little less cranberry.  I served it over rice, which caught a lot of the sauce.  Overall, very tasty!"
149363,79271,2005-10-24,5,"These are delicious, chewy cookies!
The recipe didn't really state how large to make them, so I figured they should be quite large to fit only 6 on a cookie sheet, but next time I would drop about a tablespoonful down for each cookie as they spread quite alot.
Large, spreading cookies not withstanding...we LOVED them! Thanks for posting!"

539686,237519,2008-04-16,4,"This is a very nice stir fry and pretty with the snow peas and other veggies. I have to say I like my Asian food a bit on the spicy side, so I kicked mine up a bit with more soy sauce and chili paste. However, my teenage daughters loved it just this way and declared it their favorite shrimp dish ever. Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders game."
558194,9043,2010-08-03,3,"I suppose I did something wrong, but it didn't work for me. It would be helpful to know a few things: How long do you generally simmer it before it's ""reduced by half""? When you say it should be the consistency of butter, is that softened butter? Melted butter?<br/><br/>I started this recipe at 10 at night for a party the following morning. At 1 I don't think it was reduced by half and it had a crust... but I don't know if it was the consistency of butter... Maybe the non-crust part was the consistency of melted butter...<br/><br/>I just used it anyway and it wasn't bad with scones. Not clotted cream though. If I'd had a better idea of how long it was supposed to take, etc., I would have had a better idea of if my heat was high enough, etc."

I licked the beaters like any good baker should do....lol.  How else would we know if the finished product will taste good..lmbo.  Altered recipe slightly with sugars and oils, but did all else to specifications.  I'm hopin' 4 a winner, cause they sure tasted good on the beater. Thanks for the recipe."
1737438,239547,2011-10-16,5,"I had a can of salmon in the pantry, and the only recipe I could think of was salmon cakes.  Thanks to food.com and Pennelopy, I was able to create this wonderful dish.  It was truly delicious, and we have leftovers!"
988983,113528,2008-11-13,5,Absolutely love this recipe!!!!  We made it one night for just the two of us and now we are getting together with friends and taking this with us!  It's something we plan on taking to Thanksgiving Dinner and Christmas Dinner!  We can't stop raving about it!  Thanks for sharing!!!!
93006,24344,2004-11-15,4,"A very tasty, sweet muffin that I will definitely make again.  Next time I think I'll making cornbread rather than muffins though - just my preference."
2000133881,107786,2015-04-11,0,"I am cooking these as I type, and am sure they are going to be fabulous. I just wanted to mention how easy it is to make your own barbecue sauce.  I don&#039;t like the super-sweet Baby Rays so much -- 19 grams of sugar in 2 tablespoons, plus my husband was just diagnosed with pre-diabetes!  

There are so many good recipes out there, but I saute a 1/2 cup minced  onion (not Vidalia -- which has as much sugar as Coca Cola, but a regular yellow onion),  add a minced fresh garlic clove for a couple minutes at the and of the onion -- on low, don&#039;t burn them.  Then add a cup of ketchup, or whiz a can of diced tomatoes in the blender, or add a can of plain canned tomato sauce -- whatever you have in the pantry.   Add a bit of cider vinegar, and whatever spices you like in BBQ sauce.  I like some coriander and cardamom,  a couple tablespoons of FRESH lemon juice and minced lemon rind from that same lemon.  The lemon rind makes the sauce, to me. If you want some sweetness, add a couple tablespoons of some of that jelly your family member or friend made that you got for Christmas.  I used Delaware Slaughter Beach Plum Jelly in mine.  Oh, and black pepper, freshly ground, to your taste, plus a couple shakes of hot sauce (I use Crystal&#039;s) if you like.  Let this just mellow at a very low heat while your meat cooks.  You&#039;ll be surprised how fresh and good it is, and not nearly as heavy as the commercial stuff."
1742738,352873,2013-08-14,3,"Bergy......of course yours was good, you used pork tenderloin instead of the cheap cut, pork steak.  You should not review a recipe if you change the main ingredient.&lt;br/&gt;This was ok but I believe it should be baked and not braised."
226863,392907,2010-06-30,5,"I don't think my little ""chicken balls"" turned out as pretty as kellychris's, but they sure were delicious!  I'm sure these are supposed to be Asian, but we dipped into tzatziki (sp?) sauce and loved it! Kids dunked in ketchup of course lol!  Made for Zingo in ZWT6 by an Unruly Under the Influence.  Thanks for sharing!"
275326,1306,2009-11-15,5,"I was making a last-minute dinner, so I didn't have time to marinade it overnight, so I just dumped it in the skillet and it still turned out great!  I used a bag of frozen onions & peppers and just used taco seasoning instead of salt, cumin, oregano, and pepper.  Lime juice was just the perfect thing!  Excellent."
67899,44273,2003-10-14,5,"I wish I could give these more than 5 stars. They're amazing! The fact that you can use the beaters to mix the whole thing makes them so easy to prepare, and they really satisfy your sweet tooth! The frosting is definitely a must. I made these for dessert tonight, and my mom has already asked me for the recipe. I'll be making these again very soon!"
280271,331100,2008-10-22,5,This are so easy to make and so yummy to eat. I loved them. Made as posted except used slice green onion instead of the chives. Served sour cream and salsa on the side. Thanks for posting. :)
868654,258679,2008-08-23,5,Just like all the others have said... Not your run of the mill spaghetti sauce here. Rich in flavors that will keep you going back to the pot!  We filled our tummies and had big old smiles on our faces.  Had with Garlic bread toasted in the oven.  Thanks for this one Ms. Linda!
769728,89124,2009-10-14,5,"I just made this dish for the first time for my inlaws and got rave reviews! It sounded interesting and I had most of the ingredients already so I gave it a try. The only thing I did differently was that I used a little lemon zest as well to kick it up. I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce and was so glad I did! I served it over angel hair, but I could picture it with just about anything. If you're in the mood for traditional Italian then keep looking, however, it you want an awesome new staple in your book....give this a try."
1908594,141983,2014-01-23,5,"They&#039;re not lying! BETTER THAN OLIVE GARDEN! Which shocks us, because we have yet to find one better! Change ingredients? NOT A DROP! Added grilled chicken, that&#039;s it!! LOVED IT!"
197023,247817,2008-08-26,5,"Wonderfully delicious and healthy: a great alternative to sour cream, particularly for anyone who is lactose intolerant.  We enjoyed this - simply to try it, as I'd tagged it in 1-2-3 Hit Wonders - with bmcnicol's Crock Pot Baked Potatoes 259599 and a mushroom dish.  The only changes I made were to add a clove of finely minced garlic and about 1/4 teaspoon of cumin.  Thanks for sharing another great recipe!"
112411,43072,2004-11-01,5,"I absolutely loved these! They kind of resembled buttermilk pancakes for me. My batter was a bit to runny, so I added 1 TBSP. wheat germ and 1 TBSP. flax seed. FABULOUS!"
2000677024,121516,2017-10-20,0,The Big Boy in Jacksonville was Tops Big Boy. I use to work there in high school.
366781,196226,2012-07-01,5,I needed a dip for a pot luck and since I had all of this at home it was the one.  Boy was I glad I did.  It makes a ton and it was all gone in the first hour.  I brought chips but anything that was at the pot luck that could be dipped was used.  It does have a  strong garlic flavor but in a good way.  So if you don't like garlic you won't like this.  I had many requests for the recipe and will make again and again.  Thank you for sharing.  I did only use 1/4 tsp salt.  It was enough but I think the cheese and mayo have enough salt.
510901,129926,2011-12-05,0,So good and so very simple and quick to put together. Thank  you for this delicious posting.
417332,175264,2008-09-27,5,"I am a die hard bottled marinade user...too much trouble to make my own. The other day I was feeling froggy and decied to, so this is the one I picked...and boy am I glad I did! I only had lime juice on hand, but I don't think that made a difference. I didn't change anything else, don't think it needs it. Since we live in FL we grill almost everything and the chops on the grill with this were suberb.This was so tasty I can't wait to make pork chops again!!! Thanks for a great recipe!"
1801855145,213359,2014-02-06,5,I made this for my husband the other night for dinner and he LOVED it! Thank you so much for the recipe! I will be making this again!
889914,80044,2008-10-08,3,"this soup did have a lot of lovely flavours, but i found that some were too overpowering.. maybe i was a bit heavy handed with the sugar or the ginger - i'm not sure! it was a bit too much work for me, so i probably won't try it again. sorry!"
863903,38435,2008-06-16,5,"My first time making peach ice cream, and it's awesome. The almond extract really shows, and the flavor is awesome. I used fat free Half & Half, and the texture was great. You don't need tons of fat for a good ice cream flavor."
360437,219709,2007-06-17,5,This is a nice refreshing change from the typical mayonnaise based chicken salad. It was very simple and so flavorful! I'm sure I'll be making this again. Thanks!
355531,208471,2010-06-07,3,I found these a little dry.  I think adding some cheese and maybe some oil to the stuffing mixture before cooking might moisten things up.  They were just OK for me...
561881,191377,2007-11-08,5,"OMG my boyfriend's Italian family is gonna loooooove these, I can tell!  Can't wait to try.  Sounds delicious."
74732,274988,2008-05-16,5,"I am hardly eating any meat at all anymore and feel so much better for it. This is a soup that I make quite often and enjoy immensely. I even took it for a weekend spent with meat-eating friends, and they really enjoyed it too. No-one missed the meat!!!"
991523,394299,2009-10-13,5,"This soup was very easy and had alot of flavor!!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks ""telcherj"" for a great recipe.  This is a keeper."
2409241,66121,2013-03-09,5,My husband is one of the pickiest eaters i know and he says this is ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING!!! The only thing to change is next time I'm going to use the lower sodium soy sauce only because to us this had a saltier taste to it. I did double the sauce ingredients and the kids put the extra sauce on white rice.
539977,96499,2012-02-26,4,"Wow!!! I had one of my kids that kept asking when we could eat because it smelled so good. I DOUBLED this in my crock pot. First I put in 1 1/4 cup of presoaked small white beans that I had sprouted the day before. I used the last of my russet potatoes then used red potatoes also. I used two smoked kielbasa that were 12 oz. each an I quartered them lengthwise then cut them every half inch. I cut my onion in half and sliced it by the quarter inch, then I browned it in butter before adding it to the crock on top of the potatoes. I buy my kraut in bulk, so used 4 cups for the doubled recipe. I did not drain the kraut, so some of that liquid was used in place of the water. I only added enough water to cover the potatoes. Cooked on high for 5 hours then I put one  8 oz. brick of cream cheese on top and 8 oz. of sour cream on top of that. Twenty minutes later I came back to stir it all in. It wasn't as thick as I wanted so I added another 8 oz brick of cream cheese.<br/><br/>My mom who doesn't care for kraut loved this and most of my kids liked it too. <br/>Next time I will try to do it ""correctly"" , but this was still yummy.. And bonus, I had enough for my son and I to have for lunch the next day.<br/><br/>So I layered this in my crockpot as follows:<br/>Beans, potatoes, onions, kraut and kielbasa then black pepper."
296809,307734,2013-10-21,4,"Made as written for your 2nd Football Pool win (except I used a 9-in sq non-stick baking pan). This was an easy-fix, tasty &amp; served for a family breakfast w/bacon, fruit &amp; scrambled eggs on-the-side. My only issue was the # of servings. There were 4 of us &amp; I felt I needed to stretch the meal since it stated it served 2. Cut in quarters, the 4.5 in sq serving size was generous, would have been best w/just bacon + fruit &amp; 4 servings will improve the nutritional data. That said, it was enjoyed by all. Congrats on your 2nd FP win &amp; thx for sharing this recipe w/us."
508844,30565,2007-12-07,3,"Mine turned out really flat and very crispy.  I followed the recipe exactly, so I'm not sure what happened.  I also didn't get 7 1/2 dozen.  I used a cookie scoop and got exactly 6 dozen out of the batch."
711175,16870,2011-02-12,0,Loved this recipe as did my guests. I did not have rice vinegar on hand so used white wine instead and it still turned out great!
316523,84764,2008-05-03,5,Absolutely the best macaroni salad I have ever had!  I didnt have sweet relish so I used chopped up dill pickles... and it turned out great!  I also added green peppers and green onions just because I love the extra veggies! :)

609059,149186,2008-12-12,5,"Awesome and such an easy dough to do with my son who is 5 and doesn't have the patience for Mommy to chill the dough and then cut out!  We added miniture chocolate chips, hershey's kisses to our cut outs and baked and came out awesome!  Thanks again."
1206803,135814,2010-04-05,3,"Unfortunately, this didn't do it for me.  I like the ingredients individually, but there are many other mexican casseroled I like much better.  I think this needs the crunch of chips or something."
335321,59529,2009-11-27,1,"Not good.  Followed the recipe exactly.  The wine overpowered all other flavors, though the meat was very tender."
175333,29939,2011-11-01,5,Perfect Apple Crisp! I had a ton of apples from apple picking and this recipe was fantastic!

206722,130251,2005-10-22,5,Good and easy to make.
64625,208907,2008-12-07,5,"Enjoyed these, took to a potluck. 3 ingredients plus egg wash, wow, I'm all for simplicity. Have to practice a little more making them, though; mine weren't the prettiest items on the buffet table, but definitely one of the tastiest.  Used double layers of phyllo and cut into about 9 sections each time. Quit at 25 as that's all my baking tray could hold. Thanks for posting!"
286566,313680,2014-03-04,5,"I had some big oops problems thought I had everything but no strawberry sorbet (so had to omit) and well I don&#039;t really like bananas so was going to omit them anyway so in the end I ended up with strawberries, French vanilla yoghurt and the chocolate sauce (and as I made the dessert ahead of time the sauce had set hard on the top but was still delicious) and for dietary reasons I omitted the sugar as I really feel that the fruit itself is sweet enough but the lime added a nice astringent taste to the dish and with the sweetness from the chocolate as was, was perfect for us, thank you Lainey6605, made for I Recommend tag ame and recommended by KateL."
2001260303,294695,2016-11-22,4,"Very good but a huge problem was the recipe is very very small , I was trying to make a lot of cookies so I multipled the recipe by 4 expecting alot of cookies. In the end I had about 12 small cookies enless of course I made it very wrong but it came out good."
1336399,232496,2012-10-14,5,"This is one of the best ever all-time perfect cakes!  Everyone always loves it!  I have been making this cake forever . . . still have the magazine page I tore out from back in the day. . .  pulled out the recipe a couple of years ago . . . it is just a classic! I use the yellow cake with lemon pudding and the original is not quite like this but with the same components.  I have always wanted to experiment with a strawberry (cake mix) lemonade version  . . . I just don't see how you can go wrong with that!<br/>  Also, I find it so much even better as it sits a day or two in the pan (13 x 9)soaking up the glaze completely.  Update: The strawberry version came out very well -- I used a vanilla pudding."
318262,335904,2012-04-16,4,"Lovely combination of the cranberry and white chocolate. A great morning (or afternoon, or night) treat! Just for my personal tastes I would have preferred a tad more sugar. Also, make sure to store these in an airtight container. They bake soft and moist and perfect but will dry out overnight if you don't."
679953,348408,2009-02-15,5,"Excellent !!  This was a nice treat after coming home for valentines day dinner last night.  Very Very flavorful. The apple cider, caramel, was great . This works great with a cold, since I have one.  Made for Potluck tag. Thanks Sharon for another winner."
268651,102274,2006-12-01,5,"wow this was great!!! I've never had the actual TGI Friday's one.. but I will definately be making this again! the whole family loved it (even my little brother... thats amazing) 
loved it!!

~Sarah<3"
2001515095,443758,2017-04-30,5,Absolutely PERFECT!!! Do not try to adjust because it will not work as well. We loved it!
653438,173875,2009-09-07,5,This was a wonderful salad! I did add some diced onion and a little garlic salt for added flavor but will make this definately again. I served this with Recipe#164782#164782 by Chef#219942#219942 which made for a wonderful meal. Thank you for a delicious salad. P.S. Fresh tomatoes really add to the flavor.
424680,390968,2009-10-19,5,"Made this up just to see how I'd like doing it again during the winter holidays, & it's definitely a big hit for us! I did use a freshly picked Jonathan apple as well as homemade apple cider (instead of the apple juice), both of which we got last weekend when we ventured into the apple orchards area at Oak Glen CA! Great combo of flavors in this spread ! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Tagged, made & reviewed just for the 'halibut!']"
55578,79606,2007-04-17,5,Love it!  Yummo!  But it is spicy.  I could have used it a little less spicy but DH loved and said leave it as it is. Thanks for this great recipe.
195589,350688,2009-05-23,5,"These shrimp are awesome!!  I have been roasting shrimp for some time, no more boiled shrimp for me, they are tasteless now. They are great in other shrimp dishes too, good hot or cold. I add about a tablespoon of garlic powder to the salt and pepper, put all in a zip-loc bag, shake away and put on a sprayed sheet pan. Served with fresh lemons and a classic homemade cocktail sauce.  Couldn't be simpler. Try this one NOW, you will get rave reviews! Thanks for posting, TiffyMadrox."
2071766,48913,2011-11-19,5,"It sounds like a good recipe that I will try. I just wanted to note though, that the recipe calls for dried red kidney beans and some have mentioned using slow cookers. Using slow cookers with raw or dried red kidney beens is very dangerous. Red kidney beans need to reach full boil for a certain period of time (10 minutes has been suggested), i.e. a certain temperature, to break down the Phytohaemagglutnin (Kidney Bean Lectin) which is toxic. <br/>See http://www.foodreference.com/html/artredkidneybeanpoisoning.html. There may be some slow cookers that can safely do this, but not having one, or otherwise looking at them I do not know. All I know is that the article said that heating can actually worsen the toxicity if insufficient, So if you are not cooking the recipe as described, be careful. If someone else mentioned this, and I missed it, sorry for the duplication. <br/><br/>Not to give away anything, but this is a plot device in the fine book by the late Dick Francis, Dead Heat (2007). Highly recommended, but I like all his books. ;-) <br/><br/>Thank you Anita, for the recipe!  I look forward to trying it."
963473,49387,2009-01-29,5,"Great recipe! I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and added dried basil and oregano instead of the Italian seasoning, but I'd probably add some more seasoning next time for a little more flavor. I'd also make sure to mince the onions smaller, as I didn't take too much care to do that this time.
But overall, great flavor, simple, and easy to make! Will definitely make this again."
91296,21304,2008-08-28,5,"If I could rate this any higher I would definately have to!!! For a potato salad hating family (I'm the only one who likes it)I got lots of moans when I told them what our side dish for dinner was, but by the end of dinner they had eaten it all AND were asking for more! Really really great. Awesome when warm. I used Yukon Gold potatoes for that really buttery taste. Thanks so much for sharing!

3 Summers later and this recipe has stuck with me as my #1! I'm handing it out to family and friends as they absolutely love it, and I still make it the same way from day 1. Served great warm or cold!"
293901,198707,2009-09-12,5,"Very, very good soup with old time taste and very little work.  I used a whole chicken and added 1/2 again all the veggies.  Kept the seasonings (except salt) as written (measuring in palm of my hand) and the 8 cups of water and cooked on High for 5 hrs. Only used 2 1/2 t. salt to start and when I tasted I had to suppliment w/2 t. instant chicken bouillon....so the 4 t. salt in recipe is just right.  This will be my ""go to"" for chicken soup as you don't have to ""tend"" the noodles or chicken.  Many thanks for posting, Lainey."
101732,165969,2006-10-08,5,These are wonderful!They couldn't even totally set before they were gone(my family acts as if I never feed them!).Give us anything with coconut and we love it.Thanks for posting!!
17803,177089,2006-10-21,4,"Oh my, were these HOT.  I liked them but my DH could not take the heat!  Very easy to put together.  I baked for one hour.  I might might have to leave the chipotles out the next time  I make these.  Thanks for posting."

110930,104393,2009-09-19,5,"This was extremely flavourful and delicious!  I used a pre-cooked chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces, and added the pieces after the onions and mushrooms were nice and soft.  I also used fresh herbs from my garden...  the kitchen was so fragrant as this cooked!  I will make this again (and again and again!)"
2001350821,475190,2017-01-14,0,Di you pour the syrup while the cakes are still warm or when they are at room temp?
173579,108735,2008-12-28,5,Great fried dried apple pie recipe.  Just the right amount of cinnamon in it. Will make these many more times. Thanks for sharing.
1803540083,429838,2014-12-22,5,This was very quick and tastey. I added a can of red pepper diced Tamatoes to it as well because I like my sauce with more spice. I also added hot Italian sausage while saut
2462798,8972,2014-04-13,5,PERFECT recipe!  I have never liked Red Velvet Cake.  It&#039;s the thought of all of that dye. Yuck!  So I used Wilton gel food coloring and it became a deep red with just a tiny bit. I also subbed butter for the shortening.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I made sure to pull this out as soon as it was done and it was extremely moist!  Those saying it was dry may want to pull it sooner or check their oven temp with a thermometer (most ovens are at least 25* off unless you get them professionally calibrated).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I used Alton Brown&#039;s Cream Cheese Frosting recipe and it could not have been a better pairing!
175492,146196,2006-07-16,5,"Kitz, made this up to go with my roast tonight for dinner.  Now I normally love Yorkshire pudding anyway, but these are far and above most recipe's they are so very nice and fluffy and light.  I did use the dripping from my roast to make these, and that adds so much flavor to these. I will be eating the leftover pudding tomarrow for cold.  Thank you for this keeper recipe."
358836,247054,2009-11-05,4,"These are really yummy...used ham and turkey pepperoni (that's what I had on hand) and used a little less milk & a little more bisquick.  I still found them to be a little soft for my liking so next time I'll use a little more bisquick and make them a bit more dry.  The kids loved them and I loved how quick, easy and tasty they are (and that they are freezable...if there are any left).  I had no problem with them sticking - I used generous amounts of spray and I also let them sit for a few minutes so that they naturally pulled away from the side of the pan.  Thanks for the recipe!"

68960,36123,2007-08-21,5,"Yum!  I'm not a huge chocolate milk fan but this is really good.  The coffee gives it a real boost that I enjoyed. Great recipe, thanks Derf."
897778,69173,2011-09-18,5,Just brilliant!  Love 'em! Will NEVER pre-fry meatballs again!  I have used these with both store bought sauce and homemade (which includes a jar of sauce to help it along!) and was delicious both ways!  Will become the 'family' recipe from now on!
37449,243222,2008-05-18,5,I enjoyed this after dinner. I drank it hot. Thanks!
184762,154400,2011-08-24,0,"I've never been a fan of eggplant, but DH loves it so I made this for him.  THANK YOU - this is a great, non-threatening recipe, and very yummy!!!"
222055,111044,2007-06-30,5,These are great to impress. Looks great on the plate and looks harder to do than it actually is. The spoon works great to keep from cutting all the way through. Thank you momaphet! ZWT3 - Remembering Amy.
174991,11420,2004-12-13,5,I've made this several times and we love it.  I did use a combination of non fat yogurt and buttermilk and it was fine.  I used 1 egg and used Egg Substitute #92396 for the second egg. Definately a keeper.
415463,33921,2013-10-07,5,Have made this recipe a couple of times &amp; really enjoy it a lot. Only minor addition I made was to add  some ketchup spread on top to keep in moisture and add a bit of flavor
138429,272379,2009-02-01,5,"Very deserving of 5 stars.   So simple to put together with great flavor. I did not have the chili paste so replaced it with sweet chili sauce.
 Will definitely make this again to be served with Appetizers. Thanks for posting this great recipe"
242729,235010,2010-03-14,5,"Fabulous! I made this as posted with the exception that I added carrot and not red pepper to the beans. I used French haricot blanc beans and cooked them over a slow heat in my Le Creuset Dutch oven, for about 2 hours. Made for Cool Beans in the Photo's Forum and very much enjoyed thanks. FT:-)"
593513,60840,2011-03-18,5,"First let me say how wonderful these meatballs were. I don't care if they were Swedish or not they were delicious !!! I was going to only make half the meatball mixture and the full amount of gravy for it. But I found the mixture was way to wet with that amount of breadcrumbs and cream so I had added in the rest of the meat and went with a full batch without adding in any more cream or breadcrumbs. I had added in about a tsp of basil, oregano and Italian seasonings with the parsley. I didn't have a skillet large enough for that many meatballs at one time so I had used a dutch oven to saute them in after I had browned them in batches. The flavor of these meatballs were just so moist and tasty and the gravy was WOW....I should of doubled the gravy it was that delicious and I wished there was more to scoop up with the mashed potatoes. But it was reduced after the simmering, so wasn't too much gravy....But all these flavors combined were so good. Other than the bread crumb and cream mixture should of been half of what recipe says....these were fantastic. Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe HeatherFeather we loved them. Also they freeze absolutely great.<br/>Update:   Just wanted to say how great these taste over Israel Couscous !! I just love them."
513848,51378,2008-10-09,5,this was very good everyone enjoyed it will definately make many times thanks
2861632,217941,2013-06-12,4,"This was my first try and the taste is exquisite and very satisfying. As I read in the other reviews it will probably set better after leaving it overnight in the refrigerator and then re-heating it.  I think when I put it in the oven, my hand knocked the knob accidentally and the temperature was at 325 instead of 350, so I ended u having to cook long but the insides were still too mushy and soft.  I turned it up back to 350 and let it run another 40 minutes after the 60 and it still was mushy inside, but the outside was crispy.  No idea why, but I will try again because I am a lentil loaf lover!!  I added some thyme to it, but I don&#039;t think I will do that the next time.  I found most of the reviews very helpful in how I should bake it in the future. Thank you."
37026,34573,2003-03-04,5,Made this up and my family thought it was the real thing!!  Good recipe!
765074,139812,2009-03-04,5,"Wow! The pie was excellent on it's own, and didn't even need whipped cream on top. The custard is outstanding. I used a 9"" deep glass pie dish so I only used 3 large bananas. Thanks for sharing this recipe."
206747,351541,2013-08-17,5,"*Made for Australia/NZ swap #79*  GOOD stuff, Connie !!  We have been having VERY un-August weather, so while it was cool, I made some soup !  DH groaned with the first bite --&quot;UMM--this is GOOD &quot;!  Made according to recipe, with lots of garden rosemary -- and used my stick blender rather than food processor.  Lovely, creamy. tasty soup !  Thanks for posting !"
2000292208,535518,2018-04-13,5,"Sounded &quot;kinda&quot; nasty to me, but I tried it. Turkish eggs is a big surprise and tasted great. You have to taste it to understand it."
229850,30674,2006-02-04,5,"I have been making these for 11 years, doesn't that say something good. I love these and so does everyone I serve them to. They are very good with stew also. Thanx for posting"
2000280635,71967,2015-06-28,5,"An excellent recipe but why the caution about elderly people?
I am 73. I am pretty good home cook and prepare nearly all my meals myself. I eat many eggs and eaten by themselves I like them undercooked. Elderly people have built up their immune systems for their entire lives and less likely to be sickened by something on the shell. Eggs are naturally sterile when laid by the chicken. Any contamination comes later and is not likely."
186855,227123,2009-05-17,5,"I really liked this recipe.  The relish added a touch of sweetness which I thought was very nice.  This is the first time I've ever used the 'potato water' method, and found it interesting.   I really loved the firmer potato chunks as opposed to the 'well cooked' that I usually do.  I'll remember that trick no matter which recipe I'm using.  Thanks FrVanilla for a lovely addition to my salad collection.  I'll certainly be making this more often.  Made for the May Herb/Spice of the Month."
1533,38452,2003-01-18,5,"Well Bergy you did it again, Scott made this recipe and he said it was easy and he loved the flavor.
Beans sprouts are 1 of my fzvorite ingredients so you already know I liked it. He served it with t-bone steak and dinner rolls. Great recipe. its in my cookbook, will make again. Thanks Dancer^"
1588002,166242,2010-05-21,5,"This sauce rocks! I blend it up and put it in a squeeze bottle. It is now a staple in my fridge. I put it on lots of things, tonight it is going to be mixed with a little sour cream and used as a pizza sauce for my pulled pork (Recipe #426274) pizza. It improves with age, after a couple of weeks in the fridge it mellows as the vinegar punch diminishes and the flavors combine. a+  ******"
152393,107149,2005-01-23,5,"My whole family just Loved this quick and easy breakfast!  I was out of corn bread muffin mix, so I used a lemon poppy seed mix.  It was delicious and it was so nice to have only one pan to clean up.  I would caution anyone who tries this to make sure you make the indentation in the hash deep enough, and do NOT  use extra large eggs.  (The white of the egg tends to spread out over the pan and makes it a little messy).  I also found that 15 minutes was plenty of time to cook this - any longer and the yolks cooked too much. Thanks justaim for posting this fun and easy breakfast.  "
496803,87782,2008-04-10,4,"I really like these, and so did my guests.  The texture was wonderful- nicely broned and crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside.  I added more garlic, as we are big garlic fans.  The only issue I had was that they struck to my pan and some fell apart as I moved them to a serving dish.  Oh well, lesson learned!  Non-stick pan or foil next time.  Thanks for a great dish!"
842751,102468,2008-11-28,5,"I made this to take to my mom's for a dessert today (Thanksgiving). I used a spice cake instead of the white one. I also used an 8 oz. pkg. of cream cheese softened and mixed with my mixer with some of the condensed milk. Then, I mixed that with a can of whole cranberry sauce. On the bottom of the 9x13 pan I put a can of Wilderness Apple Pie Filling and then layered the cranberry/cream cheese mixture on top of that. Next came the pumpkin mixed with the condensed milk and the eggs. The spice cake mix went on top and was sprinkled with the melted butter. This turned out so good! I know the additives sound strange but they were scrumptuous and I brought home an empty dish. Thanks for sharing this great recipe with us. It is, indeed, a nice change from regular pumpkin pie!"
59077,56048,2003-06-05,4,Followed the recipe exactly and these were very good.  Well received at a shower.  A nice bite with just a touch of spiciness.
2001936405,534955,2018-02-10,0,Would not turn out very well if some ingredients are missed in the recipe like in this one
970611,154388,2009-05-18,3,These are good the first day but DO NOT try to save any leftovers.  The whole dish turns into mush.
2002245241,52019,2018-08-11,5,"Stuffed Italian Artichokes has been a family delight for many years your recipe is similar to ours. The difference is: After trimming the tips and separating we create a flat base then par boil till tender. Let them cool. Our ingreadents are very similar to yours but we add fresh mint and finely ground walnuts, which we add to the fresh ground cheeses and breadcrumbs. Our favorite dripping sauce is lemon/butter/garlic blend."
603504,87420,2009-01-06,4,"My family & I didn't like this sauce with pork. However, we did love the sauce. The mixture of Liptons onion soup mix & cream of mushroom soup makes an excellent sauce/gravy. Thanks for sharing."
233588,73879,2006-01-26,5,UPDATE...Just wanted to let everyone know that I froze one of the babka loaves when I initially made the recipe; I took the frozen loaf out yesterday and it tastes just as good as the day it was made.  Thank you again for posting this wonderful recipe.
37584,31235,2005-01-26,5,"I had to give this a second review, I tasted it while it was still a bit warm and the flavors had not developed ... 
Wait for it to cool completely!
This is FABU! Nice and sweet and vanilla-y.
5 star recipe, nice and crunchy and I make it with cranberried and sliced almonds. Better than store bought!
I also like that all of the ingredients can be bought at any store."
38643,306649,2014-01-07,5,This may be my new favorite dessert.  I&#039;m not sure it tastes like a cinnabon but it is really good.  I also like how it&#039;s made with ingredients I usually have on hand.
394085,373560,2010-02-01,4,"Wonderfully old-fashioned and delicious!  Squash, onions and bacon...there is no better combination."
57045,40013,2002-10-08,5,"The caliente pizza was very tasty, however i used artichokes and fresh sliced tomatoes for toppings instead of anchovies and olives."
284904,298090,2010-05-30,5,"Michelle, This is a FantasticChocolateSauce recipe. We loved the smooth consistency and rich flavor.. Used it on vanilla ice cream...  Putting this in my use again soon file.."
1008402,245599,2012-06-03,5,Delicious! Raves from everyone at the table and it looks beautiful. I also added some grilled red potatoes and sweet potatoes. (I think next time if I add the potatoes I would increase the amount of dressing as the potatoes absorbed more of it.) Thanks for the recipe!
1269015,65287,2009-06-17,4,"These were fantastic served over rice - such a nice change from ""the usual""! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe, Fluffy!"
204024,499931,2013-05-18,5,Great buttermilk flavor.  I added a little more milk than was called for and that made them just the right thickness.   Made for Name that Ingredient!!
1321577,74935,2010-01-12,4,"This torte is soo delicious!  I made it for New Year's Eve dinner.  I used only Filling 1 recipe for my torte.  It didn't thicken but I suppose that was mostly my fault as I didn't cook it long enough.  So I put the mixture in a saucepan and cooked it until it became thick.  For my second filling, I just used condensed milk (400 gms) and butter (200g) as suggested by my husband from the Russian sites that he checked.  Also, I felt there's too much egg yolks and I wouldn't know what to do with the whites I would be left with.  After assembling, I covered the torte with crumbs and almond slivers.  By the way, after assembling, the cake should be allowed to rest at room temperature for 7 - 8 hours (or overnight) so that the cake layers will absorb the cream and soften.  I placed mine directly in the fridge and I ended up with a hard cake.  We then left it out and it eventually softened."
428885,386251,2009-09-01,5,"This is an Italian delight! We adored this, and followed this exactly, except for the addition of fresh garden peas, tossed hap-hazardly on top of the soup. I used freshly chopped tomatoes, and this was enough to send us over the top. Very easy to put together, and for the love of vegetables this sits front and center. I might had some vegan crumbles (ground beef-like) next time, but this is not necessary and so lovely just by itself. Made for *Veggie Vegan Swap*  August 2009."
182624,175635,2007-07-02,5,"OH....MY.....GOODNESS!!!  This is the yummiest fruit salad on the planet!  I was looking for a side to go with recipe#59224, and this fit the bill!  I was hesitant to sprinkle three whole melons with cayenne before I knew the outcome, so I opted for some pre-cut melon from the salad bar.  I used about a cup each of honeydew and cantaloupe, two cups of watermelon, one very small cucumber, the juice of half a lime, then just lightly sprinkled some cayenne...it was PERFECT!!  I didn't use any salt and didn't feel it needed any.  I also just diced the melon and mixed it all together and served it in a bowl instead of dipping and placing them separately on a tray.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!"
1657646,22080,2012-11-03,5,OMG!  These are wonderful and easy to make.  Thanks Miss Erin!!!
67656,211499,2007-03-17,4,"Loved the combination of carrots and fennel in this colorful salad.  The cinnamon, apricots and orange made a light and fruity dressing that enhanced the overall dish. I used my mandoline to shave the carrots and fennel and in keeping with that slice d the apricots into slivers.  Served this with my curry tuna salad, which worked well as the sweetness here balanced the curry well. My one reaction was that the dressing lacked a little acidity.  Ended up adding a teaspoon or two of white balsamic vinegar to the leftovers and thought it was the missing component which made something really very good into great.  This is one I will make often as it works so well with salads or grilled meats.  Thank you so much!"
125984,40577,2004-03-14,0,"These are yummy!!!  I tossed them with olive oil and did add the seseame seeds.  Thanks for this recipe, I definitely will be making these again instead of the ol'bland ones of just steaming..

Denise"
2001040295,222712,2017-10-20,5,Delicious!! Baking in wine keeps the fish tender and moist. Didnât like the look of the reduced juices so I added 2 tablespoon of creme fraiche to finish
128473,406001,2013-02-17,4,"I love coconut and decided to treat myself to this lovely coffee for Valentines Day. To make it more festive I used pink/orange/white coconut, which was toasted.   I did enjoy this coffee but must agree with AZPARZYCH that the rum flavor was a little overpowering. Thank you for sharing your recipe SarahBeth."
158086,125735,2007-05-07,5,These were wonderful...I made them with blackberry sugar free jam and sprinkled some mixed berries on...very easy and a fast recipe...
233583,468433,2011-12-03,5,"Made for CrazE Contest 2011.  DH and I really enjoyed this soup.  I had all ingredients on hand so it was a perfect recipe fo me to put togetrher on a chilly day.  We served this with a romaine salad with feta and a crusty french bread slathered in melted cheese.  OH what a fine meal on a cold windy day.  I will certainly make this again but will add garlic and perhaps cut down on the chili powder for personal tastes. We love garlic in just about everything, especially during cold season.  Lovely recipe chef. Good luck to you!"
452940,210469,2008-03-18,3,This is a very nice and light dessert and simple to put together. The presentation is beautiful. I made the crust using phyllo dough.
208755,317120,2009-04-27,5,"So, so, so very easy and delicious. Perfection. I'm not even sure what else I can say, but these were a hit, and I will make them again and again. Fresh garlic helped to make them insanely good."
636407,294564,2010-01-10,5,Quick and so easy to make. I will make this again
760429,179877,2009-01-27,4,"These were good. I didn't mash them up and I omitted the cheese. As the only vegetarian in the house, my dad makes me hunt down protein-packed dishes to have in place of whatever our main dish is. I will probably be making these again soon."
153067,105963,2005-03-21,3,"This was not bad by any means, but it just didn't ""wow"" me.  I made it with the ravioli.  I think next time I'll try making it with sausage or chicken.  One thing it was, was very easy.  I liked that about it, and may just modify it.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  LA :-)"
1477540,2886,2016-09-18,5,"Wow! I'm very impressed! Moist, full of flavor, few ingredients and easy! Finally the kind of banana bread I had hope for, just banana taste and no cinnamon or nutmeg overwhelming. I won't change a thing of this recipe, except for personal taste, I will maybe use a little less butter, a little less sugar and cook 5 to 10 minutes less because of individual oven. Thanks for a winning recipe!"
489482,162864,2011-02-05,4,Very good soup; we recommend pureeing 1-2 cups to thicken it up! :)
361489,53879,2007-12-27,5,This is so awesome!  I forgot to review it when I made it some time ago... but I am making it again and here is my review!  I did not change a thing except I omitted the green pepper as DB hates them.  Nice flavor and a little spicy which we love!
917568,145027,2010-03-06,5,"Wonderful bread!  I used 1 1/2 cups of white whole wheat flour because it's my favorite, and paired with that hint of honey, this was a spectacular loaf.  My mom was over this afternoon and we mowed through half of it together.  I soaked my whole wheat flour in the water to soften up the bran before adding any other ingredients, and added 2 tablespoons of potato flakes to make it nice and moist.  This was a high riser, and with an incredibly soft, airy crumb you don't usually get from whole grain bread.  My mom asked me twice to send her the recipe.  Thanks for a winner, Charmie."
362184,8418,2011-08-07,5,"Wonderful crust!  Did not use the pie recipe, but instead used this crust with the Fresh Peach Brown Sugar Pie found on this site.  Yummm. UPDATE:  Again, such a wonderful crust!  This time, used the pie recipe today as well, adding 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the filling.  Yummy, yummy, yummy"
701052,151267,2009-01-21,5,Very nice and crispy!
2001677878,163577,2017-08-22,5,"I had never seen a cheese free enchilada recipe, and I must say it was delicious!! I used leftover pulled pork and added grilled onion, garlic, and a can of tomatoes &amp; green chilis and a tblsp of chipotle chili. Hatch medium red enchilada sauce. Black beans and fresh cilantro chopped was added to the inside of the enchilada and on half of the batch I did add Monterey Jack cheese to the inside of the enchilada. The cheese enchiladas were then covered with cheese and baked as directed. To serve I had a little extra sauce to spoon on, fresh cilantro, green onions, avocado, and sour cream. Everyone loved this including the person who can't eat dairy!"
396517,28758,2006-11-29,5,I have been looking for a good pumpkin pie recipe for three years and stumbled across this recipe for Thanksgiving.  My husband said I hit the mark with this recipe.  The perfect blend of spices with good texture.  I followed the recipe as it and added a bit of additional cinnamon.
107554,8701,2005-01-01,5,Fabulous!  Fall off the bone delicious. This recipe is being moved to my T&T cookbook.  
189616,70920,2005-10-08,5,"Never heard of banana crumble before, glad I spotted this recipe. My ramekins must have been a smaller size than recipe called for, because I only used 3 bananas and had topping left over. The aroma was wonderful! I used rolled oats instead of granola
Thank You dojemi-"
629660,26526,2007-11-28,5,"Tastes awesome, the hubby loved it. It wasn't hard at all!"
95743,101967,2005-02-12,5,"Very good.  I didn't read the instructions ahead of time and therefore had only half an hour to do the 6 hour soak.  I just boiled the eggplant as instructed and didn't find it bitter at all in the finished casserole.  I was concerned the breadcrumbs were too dry after soaking in the milk and as it turned out, they were.  Next time I'll add more milk because the eggplant doesn't add any liquid to the casserole."
21841,144789,2006-01-04,5,I made for Christmas dinner.  It was wonderful and so easy.  I didn't have the cheese soup but i don't think anyone noticed.  This is a keeper.
803866,76652,2008-03-28,2,"This recipe is edible. That's the best I can say about it. The use of cream cheese makes the sauce sticky and if you follow the directions and start the pasta when it says to, you really have enough time to make a bachelmel sauce or even a straight cream sauce. I will not make this again."
2657691,126237,2013-05-19,5,"I made this recipe with not only rhubarb, but also with cherries, apples, and with blueberries.  I loved them all!  Had them with tea and coffee instead of ice cream and it went very well! The rest is in the refrigerator for tomorrow."
253407,40467,2008-10-30,5,"Wonderful! This is very easy and quick to throw together! I used Recipe #47491 for the sauce! I cut everything in half, and it still turned out wonderful! DS loves this, so I will be making this more often. Thank for posting!"
242729,172727,2008-07-01,5,"This is a FABULOUS recipe Toni - my mum in particular LOVED this, she is a vegetarian and has copied this recipe! I will not pretend that it does take some time to prepare all the vegetables, but the result was amazing - and mum and I had a bottle of wine to keep us company! We lived in Africa for many years and were thrilled to stumble across this VERY authentic African bean recipe - thanks so much! I used olive oil instead of rape/canola oil - everything else was as posted. Made for ZWT4 - photos to follow, still on my camera! Thanks Toni-kins! FT:-)"
527886,149491,2007-11-23,3,"This bread makes a very nice texture, moist without being soggy, even after been stored for a few days. However, I used a mild cheese, and didn't get any cheese flavor, only cranberry. This might change with a sharp cheddar, although that could also change the texture."
443633,80118,2008-02-03,4,Very good and easy.
498271,358584,2012-01-25,4,"Simple yet delicious way to prepare peppers!  I cut this back to 2 peppers and basically eyeballed the ingredient quantities (probably used more garlic than called for).  Great as is, next time I may add a sprinkling of crushed red pepper flakes.  Served with some cheese toast for a filling and healthy lunch - thanks for sharing your recipe!  Made for the Best of 2011 event, recommended by Chocolatl"
1440828,55768,2010-02-09,5,"This is the most amazing dish! I've made it so many times, eating it day after day, and I'm still not tired of it! It's great as a stand alone meal, awesome with chips, and makes a fantastic topping for a chicken salad! I've altered just a few minor things- added an extra can of beans, substituted 2 cans rotelle for tomatoes, and added 1/2 tsp of curry.  YUM!  thank you, thank you, thank you!"
116401,100613,2005-09-17,5,I have to agree the use of worcestershire sauce and the oregano really made these very flavorful. A great appetizer recipe--I didnt change a thing=Thanks!PeggyLynn
68526,283068,2008-10-16,5,"I used whole wheat flour and Splenda, and added a small container of raspberries in with the mix to whip these up, and they were great! What a lovely breakfast for me this morning. I halved the recipe where it is just my DS and I. I enjoyed them so much in fact, they are headed to my favorites right now! Thank you for sharing Sarah! Made for Zaar Stars Tag Game  Linda"
213139,271691,2009-09-28,5,Very good with just a touch of sweetness. DD loves kettle corn and now we don't have to buy this expensive packs of MW popcorn nor do we get all the junk that is in them!  Thanks for posting this MsSally!  Made for Zaar Stars.
33159,91786,2009-01-30,4,"This is really good!  Very sweet with a bit of a bite.  Unless you have a whole crowd to feed, you may want to make a half recipe - a little goes a long way.  I served warm at Sewing Circle with vanilla ice-cream on the side."
220433,9769,2011-08-03,5,"Thanks for the Awesome recipe. I think some people may be confused because it is so easy to make. I used canned sliced potatoes and since I only had one can of Cream of Chicken I used Cream of Mushroom for the other. I used low sodium to help cut it down some then let people season per taste. I agree the spices did not seem just right but it is a great start and certainly a HUGE time saver. Before I added the peas and carrots, I took some tongs and stirred it up. The Chicken just fell apart and mixed in great. If you have any large chunks just use the tongs to break it up. Since I like a bottom and top crust I followed some other reviewers tips and used the refrigerated pie crusts. I put the bottom crust in and baked it a few minutes before filling it. I am giving 5 stars."
572672,4764,2008-12-22,5,"This is really good and really, really easy...which is great!  I made it for a Thanksgiving party at work, and again for the family on Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it."
348192,108383,2006-10-16,5,This recipe was melt in your mouth and a great appetizer. It was very simple to make and my family gobbled it all up with smiles on their faces!! I will be making this recipe often.
27643,16102,2002-06-29,4,"Great change from the ordinary! I made it without the prosciutto (didn't have any on hand) but it was delicious none the less. The warm dressing is just perfect, we loved the toasty pine nuts. Will make this again and with the prosciutto next time! Thanks s'kat!"
583401,252920,2016-08-19,5,"This was great. I thought it would be too sweet, but it wasn't. I also put the spices in a small tea sache to keep it out of the final product. Sealed beautifully. Can't wait to use it up!"
601528,304348,2009-01-25,3,Mmmmm this was interesting and different but not quite my cup of tea so to speak.  I think the cocoa destracted me from the flavors of the chai I was hoping for.  Always good to try good things though.  Thanks for a new experience Mandy!
2001915464,54257,2018-01-06,5,Really awesome recipe!
1072593,361955,2011-09-22,5,"I've an abundance of lemons and I like to transform them into refreshing and satisfying lemon beverages.  I, too, sometimes add a squeeze behind the ear for a fresh lemony smell. 8-)"
804550,23938,2008-04-22,5,"Super moist tasty halibut steak recipe. Yum. I didn't use corn flakes as I didn't have any, so I used potato flakes instead. Next time I plan on trying it with the corn flakes and I also plan on using filets as the steaks we had were rather bony (not recipe's fault). We were all impressed as to how moist and tender the fish was."
1048179,440696,2011-06-08,5,"These were very good. They had a very different flavor than my normal bacon and onion greens, and I liked the acidity from the tomatoes. The thyme also added great flavor. Would make these again."
424680,386673,2009-09-13,5,"VERY, VERY NICE PUDDING (but then I'm a great fan of the cranberry), & the recipe is well worth keeping on hand! I look forward to having this pudding topped with a generous spoon of homemade cranberry sauce during the winter holidays, but as is, it's still a very tasty treat! Thanks for sharing it! [Tagged, made & reviewed in Please Review My Recipe]"
118268,30360,2004-09-21,5,This was a great recipe even though I forgot to serve with the butter. The whole family loved it!
172884,17998,2007-01-05,5,"I've made this twice and each time it was a hit with my picky teenagers. Like one of the other reviewers, I used Italian bread crumbs, boneless breasts & cooked for 30 mins. Simple and quick to make and delicious. Thanks for another great recipe."
1457418,5170,2010-05-15,5,"My go to recipe! Fluffy, nice texture and flavor. Didn't have butter so I subbed same amount of canola oil and turned out fine. Thanks for sharing Pete and Bill!"
146665,52276,2004-06-18,2,"I thought this recipe was kind of boring. It tasted like it was missing something and needed more. I tried adding vanilla extract and a little bit of ice cream, but nothing really gave it much flavor. I ended up throwing it out because nobody in my house really liked it all that well."
579298,20733,2010-04-08,5,"These went over tremendously well! Though they were very difficult to part with. A dangerous treat to have in your house for sure! I'd even go to the length to say that they were BETTER than Cadbury's. Now, my only complaint is the amount of time and effort it took to make. I have a toddler, and very limited time... so this ended up taking me two days to finish. Plus, every time I took them out of the fridge or freezer they would thaw quicker than I could get more than a handful progressed to the next stage. Toward the end I decided to leave the molds in the freezer and take out one at a time to coat in the chocolate - if only I had thought of that sooner!"
57695,87171,2005-05-05,5,"This was very good. I used my leftover pot roast and potatoes. Like Gina I was skeptical if it was going to get crispy, after adding all the liquids it turns into a very thick gravy.  But it all evaporates and forms the crust and is very good!"
1347492,43703,2009-09-29,3,"I followed this recipe exactly, and it would not set. It is this messy, runny goo. It tastes good, but I think I'll use less butter and see how that works."
622972,17978,2009-11-29,4,"This was pretty good.  I had defrosted salmon fillets and forgot I couldn't use the oven and it was raining - so the grill was out too.  I didn't have lemon juice so I substituted lemon pepper and some garlic.  I also cut back on the butter.  Not bad at all, and very quick.  We served it with brown rice and green beans."
28087,190442,2008-12-28,5,"So simple yet full of flavor, I also left out the water and just covered and simmered for about 10 minutes. I also think the seasoning salt is the key to making this so good. These would be a good side to any meal. Thanks!"
567907,49542,2010-01-19,5,Ooey gooey goodness! I reduced the sugar to 3/4 c. of brown and 3/4 brown and they're still sweet enough for my sweet tooth husband. Thanks for the recipe!
115758,76820,2007-06-21,5,"Lovely soft cookies....The spice is just right! I subbed golden syrup for the molasses, didn't bother chilling and didn't roll in sugar. I found them sweet enough and think for me the extra sugar would have made them too sweet for us. I just dropped teaspoons on a lined baking tray and smoothed them out some with my fingers which I dipped in water to prevent sticking. A great cookie, thanks for sharing.Reviewewd for ZWT3"
117853,80560,2005-03-13,5,This was very easy to make. My family loved it. I added more potatoes as my family loves them. 
37636,176261,2008-10-08,5,What a great German potato salad!  We liked that the potatoes are diced instead of sliced - gave it a different texture.  And the seasonings were just perfect.  This went great with a bratwurst skillet with onions & peppers.  Thanks for posting! ~Sue
146179,32844,2004-06-15,5,We made this twice this weekend - We tasted why this is #1 on the top 40.  FANTASTIC!  This will be on our rotation!  
424680,409744,2010-03-31,5,"Took me almost no time at all (surprise, surprise!) to locate a market that stocked adzuki beans, so I managed to have all the ingredients needed for this chili! I even got brave & DIDN'T reduce the amounts of the 'hot' ingredients this time, & both of us here were pleasantly surprised at how satisfying the taste turned out! When finished, I did freeze some of it for future use, something that's always nice for busy people! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

306726,496552,2013-03-11,5,Lovely recipe!
269198,103011,2006-04-08,5,Great recipe! This one is a definite keeper! My 4 year old boy kept asking for more. This is much healthier than Wonder bread is for him. Thanks for the great recipe!
430236,234523,2008-01-29,4,"I had my daughter read off the ingredients as I went, and after I put everything together realized there were no eggs in the recipe!  I don't know if that was a typo, but it turned out great.  I increased the butter to 1/2 cup, the cocoa to 3/4 cup, and substituted the spices with vanilla.  Very moist and delicious!"
61660,187812,2008-06-27,5,It was so humid today and this really hit the spot.  Tart and cooling!  Made for the Babes of ZWT4.
2001835836,248411,2017-12-03,0,Hi and thank you for this recipe. I love cornbread and the substitution from honey to Maple syrup took it to the moon. Absolutely fantastic!!!
167028,120175,2005-11-13,5,"Excellent recipe- new, different way to cook chicken.  Really enjoyed this. "
2001828582,146732,2017-11-28,4,"I tweaked it a little. I added spinach after the garlic and onions. I used a cup of the sour cream instead. I added a little old bay, italian seasoning and madeira wine. It turned out delicious!"
167849,101688,2005-02-13,5,Absolutely delish.  I served this for a dinner party and people were going back for seconds and thirds.  The recipe says serves 4 but it seemed to make enough for 6 or 7 adults.  Thanks for posting this SUPER EASY and SUPER TASTY recipe.
780172,161982,2008-10-16,5,"This was quite good, the chops were very tender, and the flavor was very nice. Lots of sauce leftover, next time I will make some noodles to go with it."
1272254,69191,2009-07-07,4,great dipping sauce!
133174,102498,2006-01-23,5,"This is a wonderful vegetable dish.  It has a lot of flavor and is very attractive.  The cooking times are perfect and the vegetables are done but not mushy.  I cut the potatoes in chunks, boiled them as directed and after running under water, stripped off the peel and prepared them in the specified cut.  I think it would be good with a sprinkle of red pepper flakes."
137428,165606,2006-11-28,3,"Loved the flavor. I used the orange extract. But my gumdrops turned cloudy and grainy and were really hard. Also, I couldn't get them out of the pan. They seemed fine until step 6. It seems to me that I should have added the flavor and color to the pot, instead of trying to mix it in the shallow layer of the 8x8 dish. But maybe the cooking time was off for my altitude. I know candy is picky about cooking times and methods. Greased pans and a candy thermometer might just have fixed all my problems, if I knew what temperature to cook the candy to."
290985,57034,2007-06-01,5,My husband just loves this.  I used fat free sour cream instead of yogurt and did add some dill.  I made 50% more dressing because my salads always seem to grow while making them.  Thanks
126440,234547,2016-03-27,5,My meat was so tender and loved all the flavor.  Added mushrooms that needed to be used. Will make this quick and easy meal many times again.
734592,278622,2008-11-05,3,"Instead of muffins, I made it in an 8x8 pan.  It was good but not sensational - - just a bit too light for my tastes to call it a pudding."
2049418,79506,2011-10-31,5,"Great - recipe and easy as long as the instructions are followed. I whipped the cream to medium peaks, let the gelatin bloom and then heated for 30 seconds in the microwave before incorporating with the cream.  DO NOT follow the tip to use half and half- it will not work because it does not whip to right consistency."
2001280264,481107,2016-12-03,1,"I love using kefir, but these were not fluffy. Suggestion either add some baking soda to neutralize the acid in the kefir and buttermilk OR add some fat in the form of melted butter or a bit of oil. The second modification would force you to alter the flour amount too."
92641,22227,2004-10-27,5,"My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  The flour definitely needs more seasoning, but everything else is great as is.  I've never made chicken like this before, so thanks for bringing a little Southern cuisine to our table! "
168462,129838,2007-01-10,5,My son has early morning band practices a couple of times per week and he needed something quick to grab and run out the door. These were a huge hit with him. The first time I made them as directed. The second time I added a little finely chopped polish sausage and shredded cheese in the bottom and topped with uncooked scrambled eggs. Six scrambled eggs fit perfectly into 12 muffin tins. Either way these were a great on the go breakfast. Thanks for the recipe.
482376,376829,2011-11-16,5,"Wow! Who would have thought such a seemingly easy recipe could produce that ""wow factor"". This was excellent and I'm putting it into my best of the best file. I used chicken thighs and drumsticks and they were done by 45 minutes. The flavor was soooooooo darn good. Yum!! I also loved how crispy the outside of the chicken was and yet very moist on the inside. Thank you!"
952322,3965,2009-01-22,2,"Whoa! This cocktail sauce was WAY to spicy for me, and I didn't even add any tobasco. I would have used about 1/2 tsp of horseradish for 6 tablespoons of ketchup. I ended up adding over a cup of ketchup to mellow this recipe out...and it's still spicy."
619733,47121,2007-10-28,5,"Very Good, my husband even clapped."
1336825,170480,2011-06-13,0,Who didnt know this would be your recipe!!!  Thank you AGAIN for sharing such a lovely dish!!!!
232886,106342,2007-07-10,4,"Definitely delicious! I can't wait to try toasting the leftovers tomorrow morning. Quick to put together and delicious. I upped the parmesan a little bit, as others did, in the bread itself. I think using different cheeses or adding different herbs will make a nice change for future loaves, although I just can't imagine getting tired of it just the way it is!"
2002192733,173017,2018-06-20,5,"This is super close to my family recipe! Ours doesn't use baking powder. For the BEST cornbread, use Bulgarian buttermilk. It's not going to be in some fancy packaging though. Usually at my grocery store, regular buttermilk and Bulgarian buttermilk are made by the same company and only the label on the jug is different. In a pinch regular buttermilk works too but Bulgarian just makes it taste better."
250812,53473,2010-05-16,5,"I needed a recipe for some cut up pork I had, came up on this and love it. We've made it twice. The first time just cooking the pork in the butter sauce, and putting it over some rice. The second time i cooked up the pork with some chopped up zuchinni in some sauce....then mixed it all into some rice. It was so good. Love it. Thanks."
2002123723,155576,2018-04-21,1,It had a very strange taste. I don't recommend.
187927,192148,2009-02-25,4,"This was really good! I very much enjoyed the balance of banana to pumpkin flavors, though I think I'll tone down the nutmeg or the allspice next time since the spices were a bit overpowering. My banana wasn't fully frozen, but that's okay -- I didn't want it too icy. I also added a splash more milk (rice milk, BTW) to thin it out a bit. Thanks for a much more health-friendly way to get my pumpkin-pie fix! :P"
993628,203132,2014-01-01,5,We make this every year for Christmas breakfast...for the past 7 years! I usually omit the cereal topping. Making it for my daughter&#039;s New Years Day birthday brunch this year also. My favourite brunch recipe - simple and perfect to make ahead the night before!
336145,5000,2015-01-19,5,"Absolutely wonderful.  Taste just like Cracker Barrel&#039;s, and I don&#039;t have to leave home to get it.  Great job on the instructions, too.  It&#039;s nice knowing that it also works out even if you make a few variations.  Thank you so much for sharing!!"
129201,135857,2005-09-14,5,"Excellent Nasi Goreng, Caroline. Made to the recipe apart from using a mix of red and green peppers (as I had no yellow). Colourful, full of flavour and totally enjoyed by all."
780172,326250,2014-05-19,4,"Really liked the sauce, I just had a little and it was great. I made muffin meatloaves and they are great to freeze for another meal. I used ground chicken and ground pork and followed the recipe the rest of the way."
1488183,86484,2010-03-19,4,Yummy!! I have been looking for a banana bread recipe for a while and decided to try this one.  I'm sure glad I did!!  This recipe was good.  I did follow the advice of the other reviews and bumped up the yeast.  I also didn't toast the walnuts (I always ended up burning them).  And since my boyfriend loves bananas I used a full cup instead of the half.  Thanks for the recipe!! :)
158938,270742,2011-03-01,0,"Made it. Didn't need the butter, but I did add the half and half. To make it a one dish meal, I added some frozen peas to the pasta as it was about done. Great! And proportions perfect for a single gal;-)"
162826,55124,2007-04-18,5,"Really delicious, Bev.  Made with Imitation Crab--excellent! My only suggestion is maybe a sprinkle of sliced almonds on top; otherwise, no changes.Thanks for posting. Made for Unreviewed tag game."
84196,125662,2005-11-11,5,"Just got my first batch out of the oven, and OMG, these are the best muffins I have ever eaten! Seriously!!
  I made then in my little mini muffin tins and they turned out so perfect, and they actually have a chewy texture to them, which is one of the things that make them so scrumptious. I did sub butter for the oil because I was out, and it did not affect the texture at all, just maybe a richer taste. They also have the perfect hint of lime to them. I will be making another batch to go in the freezer for my holiday yummies that I give out. People will love these!!Thank you !!"
160974,141464,2005-11-21,5,"This was easy to whip up. I liked that the dumplings did not use a packaged mix (sodium) and the added onion, which reminded us of ""hush puppies"". I did use chicken breasts and it was a very moist dish.

1601955,420052,2010-04-21,5,best choclolate cake I've ever eaten....coffee gives a great taste....absolutely decadent!!
345142,56846,2007-04-22,5,"I recently saw something similar to this at the FoodNetwork in Giada de Laurentiis' show, Everydaw Italian. I wasn't able to jot everything down and so my recipe was incomplete. Thanks for posting, now I won't have to hunt for her book.  I will definitely keep this recipe."
71324,233435,2007-10-17,3,"I'm really sorry, but the recipe didn't really work for me. I did everything as directed (except from using a green bell pepper instead of a red one, but that couldn't have made much of a difference), but even after 2 1/2 hours in the oven my black beans were still not cooked through. I ended up picking most of them back out, which was quite fiddly and added a can of kidney beans in the end, heating them through before serving it over rice. I also had to thicken the sauce a bit with some cornflower as it was very runny. The flavours were good though, with a nice heat from the chili and the hot sauce. I'd probably also add more garlic next time. Having chunks of steak was a nice change from the usual minced meat. Thanks for sharing."
27678,55267,2004-10-11,4,"We really enjoyed this recipe as a nice change after Thanksgiving. The sauce is incredible -- there just wasn't enough of it! I halved the amount of turkey, onions and red pepper because there was only 2 of us but kept the sauce amounts the same and there still wasn't enough for our tastes. The other slight change I'd make would be to cook the garlic with the onion and red pepper, as I didn't feel it got cooked enough being added towards the end with the sauce. This took way less than 40 minutes for me to make, about half that, so the recipe gets top marks for being speedy."
323328,404199,2010-03-07,4,"Thanks I'mPat; we enjoyed this tasty recipe!  I made it with a full head of cauliflower as that is what I had on hand.  I used a sharp, white cheddar, a lowfat sharp cheddar and the mozzarella.  Next time I may add a bit of salt and pepper to the white sauce, and maybe a bit more cheese, but this was a yummy dish that we'll make again!  Made for Feb/Mar '10 Potluck Tag."
183057,16902,2006-05-21,5,"A little more work than I like with my crockpot recipes but well worth the effort. The chops were the most tender we've ever had and the sauce was wonderful. We served with grits and butter beans and there was enough sauce for the grits as well. I didn't have whipping cream so I subbed a half can of condensed mushroom soup.

Fantastic!!!"

209743,28768,2005-04-28,4,"I did not find this recipes as mind blowing as I thought that it would be, but my hubby loved it. I thought that this was a very nice, very simple recipe that easily adapts to other people's preferences (like mushrooms/no mushrooms) and easily feeds a crowd. Give this a try and you will not be sorry."
558717,99481,2007-08-14,5,"I took this to our coffee hour at church, I was told, out of a scale of 1 to 10 it was a 23. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe! Great recipe!"

598657,78738,2007-10-16,5,"They came out great. I had to drop the time a bit because my pita bread was very thin, but I was happy they tasted so good with my hummus. I won't buy those greasy pita chips at the store anymore. Thanks."
537937,244966,2008-09-21,5,"Fabulous!!!!  But, then what could go wrong with these ingredients?  Nothing at all!!  I used white milk in place of chocolate and then added a healthy squirt of Hershey's Dark Chocolate Syrup.  I also omitted the crystal light.  Not sure what kind of taste that woud have added?? 
Thanks Lainey for a keeper.

286566,196177,2007-04-25,5,Ths is a two fold review.  First the marinade for the steaks (we used rump and put some sausages in as well) and it is out of this world good.  DH did overcook my steak but he hit a first were the sausages took longer to cook than expected (don't know if the marinade had something to do with it) but the steak was tender and delicious especially with the Paprika-Parmesan Butter and WHOO-WHOO DH DID NOT use any B-B-Q sauce just the butter and absolute first in nearly 30 years that I know of.  I also doubled the butter and used some to butter a small wholemeal french style stick plus one with regular garlic butter and the paprika butter taste went down really well (though didn't look all that great).  All in all a very much keeper. thank you Nick's Mom.  Made for Please Review my Recipe game.
897532,268676,2011-05-27,5,"Divine!  I served it with bite-sized water crackers instead of grilled pita, but the dip was magnificent!"
573325,441362,2010-11-09,4,"This is a great unique recipe which produces a very spicy and very moist bread that has a lovely crunchy crust.<br/>The directions are clear and easy to follow and everything comes together quite quickly.<br/>I made some changes to your recipe due to what I had on hand: I made my own self-raising flour and reduced the salt in the bread to Â½ ts in total as well as the salt in the hummus to Â½ ts. I found it still quite detectable, so that next time Im making this, I will reduce the salt to Â¼ ts in total.<br/>Also I found it to be VERY spicy with only 3/4 jalapeno, but maybe Im just a chicken. lol<br/>Instead of the canned chickpeas I used soaked, pre-cooked ones and that worked out well.<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing a wonderful recipe with us, that only needs a few tweaks to become a fav around here.<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this great recipe with us and GOOD LUCK!<br/>Made and reviewed for the Dining on A Dollar Contest November 2010."
177515,8935,2005-05-20,4,"I was a little confused when I started to put this together... I should probably know this, but is it 2 cups raw lentils, which are then cooked, or two cups measured after cooking??  Also, it would be helpful to have the actual ounce/size listed for the coconut milk and tomato sauce.  But despite all that, I just dumped lentils in until it looked right, and the final outcome was great.  I also added a few zuccinis to the sauce, and served over plain rice, with plain yougurt on the side to cut the spice. The flavor and texture were just right!  A note: for me, this made way more than 6 servings!  "
486648,176514,2010-12-22,4,"I happened to have all the ingredients this recipe called for on hand, and had a dessert to make for a party, so decided to give this one a try. I doubled the recipe and made one loaf pan and 9 cupcakes. I used homemade lemon curd and since I don't have golden caster sugar, I used sugar in the raw, and just ground it finely in my coffee grinder. I *loved* this cake! It has a beautiful lemon flavor, and the crunchy glaze on top is delicious. Thanks for a fantastic addition to our dessert table."
366815,77978,2011-01-25,5,"The longer it sits to let the flavors meld together, the better it gets. Smitten over it on the first day and gaga over it the second.  Thanks for posting this!"
76535,233122,2009-12-23,4,This was family pleasing. The allspice was an interesting touch from the other versions. Thanks for the posting!
2001372452,247685,2017-01-30,0,This is the exact recipe my Aunt from Italy gave me about 50 years ago. Everyone always enjoys this recipe!
425697,88599,2007-08-17,5,"This is almost exactly how I make my tofu cutlets and the piccata sauce is an excellent addition! I have also used tofu prepared this way instead of veal or chicken in italian parmesan recipes or used them instead of a chicken breast in a buffalo ""chicken"" sandwich. Thanks for the great idea! I just love any exuse to eat capers ;-)"
616152,19724,2014-04-13,5,"This is a wonderful rib recipe - and so easy!  Contrary to another&#039;s review, I did not find the smell of the Dr. Pepper and Liquid Smoke bad at all.  I normally smoke my ribs, but I will definitely make this again, especially in the super hot &amp; humid Florida summer months when the last place I want to be is on my patio over a hot smoker.  Thank you for an awesome recipe!"
227652,96809,2006-04-10,5,"These were SO good! I was also worried that they might turn out dry when I first took them out of the oven but they were moist. I used wheat bran, used all honey (replacing the molasses), applesauce for the oil, buttermilk& added 1/3 cup Splenda. I left out the pecans so I added another 1/2 cup chopped apple. I also ground up my oats. loved the healthy ingredients-thank you! "
504438,242048,2008-01-18,4,"thanks for this great recipe! we dont have dr oetker here in nz, but i used a pectin geller and the same amount of sugar that you stated, and the jam came out very fresh and tasty! way way better than anything you could buy.  the lavender fell apart the first time i made it and had to fish each stem out so i didnt use it the second time. we keep making this for our friends as gifts :)"
226863,370406,2009-10-18,5,"This was a very nice marinade. I marinated my NY Strip for about 2 hours, then grilled it.  I think next time I will let it marinade overnight to let my meat absorb more of the flavors.  4 stars for my short marinating time, but 5 stars for the possibilities!  Made for Zaar Stars!  Thanks for posting."
2000700957,36346,2016-08-09,0,"So Yummy! I am a vegetarian, so I used Smart Balance dairy free butter, and veggie stock. Because some reviewers said that it was a little liquidy, I added a little more orzo to help absorb any extra liquid. I made the entire recipe in my rice cooker. I sauteed the onion in the butter, right in my rice cooker, added all of the other ingredients, per the instructions, and closed the lid. It came out perfectly and sooo good!"
925990,181188,2011-01-03,4,"I usually make this in the oven. I just add 3 chicken breasts to a casserole dish (9x13), pour a jar of salsa over it, cover and bake at 350 for an hour. Comes out perfect. I also like to add shredded cheese on top and bake (uncovered) a few more minutes until melted. Serve over rice with a veggie or salad."
59144,155103,2006-07-07,5,"Dienna, If I could give you 10 stars I would! My family absolutely Loved this Recipe! Without a doubt when you can get your DH to eat something he doesn't think he likes you have really accomplished something! Thank You so much for a great recipe to use with all that wonderful Zucchini!! "
471673,26526,2008-11-09,4,"I'm only going to give this 4 stars instead of 5, because even though this came out wonderfully after it was cooked and cooled the first time.  It became really dry and brittle (even after wrapping it up well) the following days afterwords.  If I could find a way to make this a bit quicker, and store it better where it wouldn't dry out and crumble, I would definitely make it again."
874900,52381,2010-04-21,5,"Wonderful, fast, cheap meal.  I tripled the sauce and before adding the sauce ingredients to the pan I added 1/2 T of flour and let that cook in the drippings for a minute or so.  It didn't really thicken up much but was very tasty and pleasant.  Used bottled lemon juice and it's a low quality fake lemon so I bet it is way much better with fresh lemon juice.  Will make this again."
280576,76864,2010-10-06,0,"Great recipe!!  I made the icing out of powdered sugar, butter, vanilla and a little milk.  It tasted mre similiar to the icing from the store bought cin buns; but since my dh doesn't like cream cheese, that was my comprimise.  But these are so beautiful and yummy!!  Thanks!!"
1535,76540,2004-10-07,5,"I've been making these since I was a little girl. We've always used a thimble to make the doughnut holes and then also fried them up. Very quick and easy and very, very yummy!"
89831,211847,2008-07-27,5,"very good, I made this in an 8 x 8-inch baking dish with no changes, I am going to give this a try using blueberry pie filling next time, thanks for sharing Syd"
508844,117317,2007-11-02,5,"These cookies are awesome!!  I love the almond extract addition, and I was a little nervous about that.  It makes just a teeny wonderful difference.  I think next time I'm going to use 1 cup of chocolate chips because the dough itself was so good that I'd like to taste more of it. Thanks so much for a great recipe!"
1503453,141523,2009-12-30,5,"this is a great brisket recipe that's easy to make. it comes out soft, juicy, and wonderfully flavorful. I used about twice the amount of tomatoes. Everything else I followed exactly. Highly recommend!"
786169,155203,2008-03-10,5,"I made this recipe last night, it was AWESOME!  Whole family loved it, fish had a great taste and was crispy.  I was able to find ""blackened seasoning"" in the grocery store so that's what I used instead of ""cajun"".  Delicious way to eat fresh fish!"
620081,272179,2008-01-16,4,"I had to add additional seasonings (garlic powder and seasoning salt)to get the taste just right, but other than that it turned out great. It tasted great for leftovers after the seasonings had time to sit overnight. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe."
130819,43699,2004-11-22,5,This made for a great family supper last night. Made this using ground buffalo. Used one cup of ketchup and a cup of canned tomatoes. With buffalo being a sweeter meat I cut the sugar. They loved it! There was just enough left over for the hungry twelve year old to spread on a sun dried tomato tortilla later in the evening. A rerun has already been requested. Thank you for sharing.
23119,371547,2009-06-04,5,"This steak was very hot, spicy and tasty. Next time I will not use as much chili powder. I will make again."
81611,230639,2011-12-09,4,"These do taste like a genuine peanut butter cookie, but it seems to me to be more expensive than one with flour. I would definitely try this with almond butter, as peanut butter seems to not agree with me anymore (even organic). Great choice for people avoiding gluten, though!"
177961,9836,2005-02-07,4,Wonderful my son Mr I don't like chicken ate 3 helpings of it! I added some fresh mushrooms with it and it was mmm mmm good and so easy too!Thanks alot
49214,38166,2002-10-01,4,"I prepared this recipe as an entree for friends and no one noticed that the scallops were not actually cooked (I didn't bother to tell them). This is an easy dish to prepare while you are busy doing some serious cooking.
Presentation is excellent too. I will make this a regular item at my place. "
226066,264812,2007-12-18,5,Have been making something similar for years - but the toasted peppercorns so make a difference!!  This is simple and very tasty!  Only change I made was to use a different kind of pasta and some parmesan cheese.  Made for 123 Tag.  Thanks MarraMamba! :)
1614793,69191,2010-05-13,5,"The best best best!!! The peanut sauce is also versatile because you can use it on a fresh garden salad instead of using salad dressing....Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, it was great!"
220195,486132,2012-09-01,0,"Just a side note: This does look like a delicious recipe. Contemporary USDA safety standards call for tomato products to have an acidifying agent if canned in a boiling water bath, as tomato varieties are not as acidic as they once were. This can be done with lemon juice, citric acid, or vinegar. For those not familiar with the current recommendations, I suggest visiting the web site of the National Center for Home Food Preservation at the U of GA for more information. http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can3_tomato.html<br/>Freezing would not require the extra acid."
841952,17311,2009-10-29,4,"I was looking for a quick snack for me and the Hubs and I saw this and looked good enough to take a chance on. I was right! i gave it 4 stars because I did not like the nutmeg, thought it was too much. Other than that it was great. Next time I plan to omit the nutmeg and ginger and sprinkle the sugar over the donuts rather than shake them in the bag as it was too sugary. This one is a keeper!"
439685,149120,2012-11-05,2,I could not get these crispy. Ended up just being cooked squash that was a lot of work.
614212,134636,2008-01-07,5,"These are awesome, they taste great, everyone I know loved them. I made some that are white with chocolate on them, these are a little more elegant and fancy...and then I made some that are very bright colours, like something out of the grinch :)"
1580557,93914,2011-10-27,5,My favorite oven fried chicken!  Love it with chicken thighes.  the skin gets so crispy and delicious!
1633909,104244,2013-03-24,5,Very good and easy.
995434,27208,2008-10-20,5,"I made this just like the recipe said but i used a cup of water and added red potatoes, 1 onion and a small bag of baby carrots. Delicious! After cooking for 6 hours the roast was extremely flavorful and tender. My family has already requested that I make it again next week!"
456138,68999,2010-03-10,4,"This is a pretty pie! Loved the way it looked, and it tastes good too, but the pie crust bottom was soggy even though I baked it first. I found a similar recipe that bakes the crust and pie at a higher temperature and I will try that next time. May also try brushing the baked crust with beaten egg white before filling. Nice way to use up fresh garden tomatoes. Thank you."
710767,152544,2008-01-01,5,"The cupcakes tasted sensational....it truly reminded me of mum's butter cakes from when i was young. I managed to get 18 out of the batch but that meant that i couldn't make the butterfly wings because it wasn't big enough. Nevertheless, the cakes were still great. I also found that the qty for icing ingredients was insufficient to ice them all. I ended up making an extra batch. Love the custard flavouring. This is the first batch of cupcakes i've ever made from scratch. No more baking mixes from the supermarket...yay!"
526936,82102,2007-07-09,5,mine wasn't crispy but still it was sooo good and moist. and its really easy to make!
250944,117695,2005-10-10,5,This was very easy to make and very tasty!  The orange/clove combination was fabulous!  Thank you!
55578,261827,2009-06-15,4,"Nice recipe, but no General Tso's!  I will make it again, but it isn't Tso's.  With that said, my entire family loved this recipe.  The reason for 4 stars is it isn't quite as Asian as I thought it would be, but hey as a WW, it was nice."
457907,185342,2009-02-10,5,This was one of the best chicken recipes I've made yet.  Even my picky husband loved this.  It almost tastes spicy.  I think the fact that there's more parmesan cheese than breadcrumbs really gives it so much more flavor than if that were reversed.  So good!  Thanks!
65056,5031,2005-02-13,5,"I've never tried the packaged Emeril's blend, but this is lovely.  Good balanced blend of flavors- not too spicy but full of flavor.  I cut the salt down to just a pinch (I prefer to salt my food as needed).  I blended this all together in my coffee grinder.  I find it a nice addition to many dishes, Creole or not.  I added a tsp to Shrimp Chowder (#45019).  Great. Thanks Meanie.  A nice one to have in the spice rack repertoire."
210473,144573,2016-03-08,3,"Love the idea, but there was too much streusel for the amount of sweet potatoes.  Just too sweet."
316809,95032,2010-01-20,4,"I made this the other night, and it was amazingly tender. The meat literally fell off the bones. I didn't put the ingredients in the food processor - I just mixed them up and spread the mixture on the chicken. Next time, though, I'm going to double the mixture ingredients, because even though the chicken was good, I didn't feel like I got the full flavor of all the ingredients. I think the chicken I used was more than 3 pounds, so that could be the reason too. Still, this is a great recipe. Next time I'll also add rice like someone suggested. That sounds good too. Thanks for a great recipe!"
264017,434505,2011-10-29,3,"I've made this recipe twice. The first time, as written, the muffins were small, rather hard on the outside but not done on the inside. The next time, I made 3 changes and came out with a great batch of muffins! First, I decreased the Splenda to just one full cup to make a less-sweet muffin; then I added an extra 1/2 cup of boiling water to make a smoother batter; finally I baked the muffins at 350* for 16 minutes. Be sure to not overmix the batter and allow the muffins to cool in the tins before removing to a rack. Reviewed for PAC Fall '11."
1833965,285466,2011-06-03,5,"This is such a great way to have breakfast ready in the morning.  I do find I need to heat the oatmeal up in the morning (despite using a stainless steal thermos), so I prepare my microwavable dish before retiring for the night as well.  I chop a little apple and add some cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves to the dish.  In the morning I dump the oatmeal in, stir and in a minute or two I have a perfect breakfast.  Thanks!"
1735610,37143,2010-12-08,5,"I will continue making this pie, it tasted great!"
6258,16725,2002-10-13,5,"I made this side dish and it was a big hit.  Flavor wise it was wonderful with the fresh parsley and fresh thyme from my herb garden.  It made an awfully pretty dish, and we loved it.  Thanks for sharing!  I will make this one again and again!"
494867,302165,2013-03-23,5,I loved these! Just a hint of banana and a hit of nuttiness -- it was perfect.  I substituted spelt for the whole wheat flour and it turned out great.  It made about 12 on my waffle maker.  A perfect amount for the four of us.  I love that these are healthy and I love how these taste.  My new favorite!
244809,128222,2006-04-23,5,This was very tasty. I am trying to cook more fish and the whole family loved this one. Thanks for the post.
160974,167729,2006-05-15,5,"I used a cheap brand of white bread and mostly the heels. I make fresh bread crumbs a lot, but never have   used the grater disk. This made the fluffiest crumbs that baked up great. I wasn't paying much attention so they did get lightly browned, but no uneven spots. I topped my Three Cheese Baked Mashed Potatoes  Recipe #89840 with these and they added such a wonderful light crunchy topping. They really do have a better texture than regular crumbs. I've used panko crumbs before (several years ago) and think these will make an equally good breading for chicken, etc.

237795,101688,2009-02-26,5,"I saught this recipe out because I recently went went to a local restaurant and ordered what I usually ordered there (but it's not on their regular menu), tortollini ala vodka.  They must have a new cook because they left out a few key ingredients.  So, not having satisfied my taste for it, I turned to recipezaar.  Obviously it's the prosciutto that makes the dish, along with the basil.  I added chopped onion (about 1/4 c), and a little chopped roasted bell pepper (less than 1/4 c).  I omitted the parmesan - saved it to be put on the top.  I used dried basil because I didn't have fresh - that would have been wonderful, but then added a bit of fresh spinach leaves to add the green.  I served this over handmade fettucine egg noodles. I thought it came out GREAT; the taste I had been looking for at the restaurant.  My children also thought it was wonderful (although they were concerned about the word ""vodka"" in the title - that I was feeding them alcholhol!  I didn't get into it about it cooking out - just told them that was just a fancy name...;)  )  Thank you for a really good recipe. I will make this often.  And it was easy."
37449,17397,2004-01-09,5,"This made a wonderful lunch Erin! I used portabello mushrooms, green pepper, and already cooked turnip greens. I also used a blend of Colby and Monterey Jack cheese, and left out the sour cream. Thanks Erin, for  a easy, yummy dish!"
2001074637,368118,2016-07-04,5,"This is a great recipe. I highly recommend pre-baking the tater tots per the instructions on the package. I use the store brand breakfast sausage that comes in a roll. While the tots are baking fry sausage, then in a bowl, mix together the gravy mix, water, and eggs. I also like to double the amount of cheese, adding half into the egg mixture before baking. After 20 mins in oven, sprinkle on the other cup of cheese, bake for 3-5 mins and wallah! Dinner is served. That's right, I said dinner because that's when my family likes to enjoy it."
369715,37734,2010-07-21,4,Good and easy to make. I doubled the recipe and used onion powder instead of onions. We all enjoyed this.
170137,43112,2007-12-28,5,"This was yummy...really good comfort food.  I made it just like the recipe, but I live in Vienna and we can't buy cream of Chicken soup, so I used a package of(creamy)Garlic Soup(Knorr)(I only used 2/3 the amount of water it called for).  It was really easy to make and a great way to use up leftover Christmas ham.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for a yummy new recipe."
55729,33550,2011-08-05,4,"This was a bit of a surprise to me. I didn't expect a cooked dressing, but it turned out well. A bit spicy from the pepper, oddly enough. My daughter loved it and I also enjoyed it, but the boys thought it was ""too weird"" to even try it. The vegetables retain their texture for a long time (well over a week, actually). I will probably make this again, since it is one of the rare ways I have enjoyed canned mixed vegetables (which I already have in the house and need to use up)."
1143213,22941,2011-08-29,5,"This is the best and it's easy to make.I cut up and added a Chorizo to this dish, what an extra taste. Once you make this you will never stop."
37449,248292,2008-08-05,4,I really enjoyed these patties for breakfast this morning! I used homemade veg. broth and button mushrooms. Good flavor and they held together well. Thanks Prose!
449242,81968,2008-09-01,3,Good chickpea recipe.
1906011,2496,2012-05-24,5,I have been searching for a recipe like this.  This cake was great and everyone loved it.  I can't wait to make it again.
205983,41491,2007-04-06,5,"I am so happy someone had this reciepe, my brother would make it years ago and i lost mine.  Thank you for having it, by your nick-name I am thinking you are from the U.P.  I am to.. Lets face it who else would make sticky buns with ice cream except for Yoopers!!!!   I always made this in a bread pan seems to work nice too.  Each is to there own on baking methods though."
2001630331,108364,2017-07-17,5,Made this tonight. Huge success!!! Best homemade fried chicken ever!
157425,179795,2008-10-06,5,"Great comfort food! I used Ball Park hot dogs, a 28 ounce can of Bush Beans, dried minced onion, and brown mustard. Doubled the amount of ketchup and mustard but used the 2 tablespoons of brown sugar as that was sweet enough for us. Baked for 40 minutes covered and than 20 minutes uncovered. The bacon did not really cook as much as I would have liked it to but did add a nice smokey flavor. Will make this again! Made and reviewed for the Think Pink - Breast Cancer Awareness Tag Game."
1967974,179439,2011-07-26,0,I loved the recipe. The family even liked it. But I did change it and used French's fried onions instead of cornflakes. I didn't have any and that sounded like a very good variation.
80789,38971,2005-01-11,5,This was very delicious and so simple to make!  The only change I made was to cook the onions with the patties.  I then poured sauce (with a little bit of water to thin it) and let it cook.  I will try it with the tomato sauce next time.
138741,68684,2004-05-27,5,"To die for. So yummy. Similar in texture and look as a rootbeer float, but tastes like warm apple pie in a glass. Delish!! Easy to make and buy the GOOD ice cream, it's worth it for this recipe!"
1803489821,113611,2014-12-11,3,"I&#039;ve made something similar to this using chow mein noodles.  But didn&#039;t have the noodles on hand, so I decided to try using special k.  The treats are good but fell apart.  I would recommend using less of the cereal so you&#039;ll have enough of the butterscotch/peanut butter to bind it together."
17803,10053,2008-11-24,5,"Tom, you have another winner here!  It is absolutely perfect.  We used leftover baked potatoes in making ours.  I've never had lemon juice in my potato salad before, most always made with pickled relish.  I was not sure what salad mustard was either, so I used regular mustard.  Made for *Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup 2008* game"
1015521,50245,2011-08-30,5,Delicious!!! Everyone loved it! So easy and deliccious will be making this again and again!
723491,255140,2008-06-14,5,"I made these for my nephews graduation party and they were a big hit! I chopped everything really really tiny, so the flavors could meld together.   Everyone seemed to like them as the dish was empty at the end of the evening!  I loved the Mediterranean flavors the made these so special.  Will make again soon.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!"
836708,185806,2010-04-19,4,"Very good.... and I made quite a few changes, so not sure if this is a fair rating.  First off, I was a little confused by the ""1/2 - 1 cup liquid"" and after making them, wondered if it should state ""1 1/2 cups"" of liquid? I used about 1/4 cup sugar, as I am always trying to reduce calories/sugar. I was too lazy to zest the oranges, and actually used 2 oranges, juicing them by hand and adding a bit of the pulp after juicing. I think next time, I will take the effort to include the zest as I would have liked them more orange-y.  I tried substituting apple sauce for the oil, but it was very very dry, so ended up adding about 1/4 cup oil and a total of about 1 and 1/4 cup soymilk (which is I why I wonder if the recipe should call for 1 1/2 cups?) Next time, I'll include the zest, use orange juice, and start off with more liquid. And I think chopped nuts would be great too! Thanks for a good vegan muffin!"
1225333,305278,2010-06-08,5,This is simply delicious. I first had a honey lavender butter at the sky cafe in the space needle in seattle and was charmed. This recipe is so similar that I would say its an almost exact duplicate. My batch separated so next time I will make sure the butter is way soft and use a blender or food processor. I used this on a dish of plain brown rice pasta for a side dish to buffalo steaks. Fantastic!!!!!
41578,15277,2002-07-26,5,"This is a wonderful way to use fresh produce!  I'm fortunate to have an excellent Italian grocery store nearby where I can buy the fresh mozzarella.  I overlapped the cucumber slices, the tomato slices and the mozzarella slices on a plate to make a pretty flower pattern.  I used fresh basil leaves from my herb garden.  Soooo good.  Thanks for sharing this.  :-)"
1618985,412072,2010-05-20,5,Great recipe.  I upped the chilli flakes and as my oven's hot it needed 10 mins less cooking - the result was sticky sweet salty and spicy ribs - just perfect.  Will repeat for sure!
2347920,9822,2012-07-31,4,"I was brought up on foods like these. My Mom was quite often alone and with 5 kids to feed she needed easy, filling good. I still love them to this day. The only thing I found different in this recipe is the amount of milk..I was taught a roux was usually 1 butter (tbsp)   1 flour (tbsp)  1 cup of milk or milk mixed with the juice of the peas or whatever vegetable you are using. Due to illness, there are many foods I can't eat but I love these comfort ones and they don't hurt me. I use olive oil becel in a dish, covered, and melt it in the microwave. I quickly whisk in the equal amount flour, then slowly add the milk pea juice to equal, whisking, then microwaving covered for 1 minute at a time then whisk each time. Once the peas are in, another minute or so in the microwave. Another goodie is creamed asparagus on toast..I mash the asparagus before adding to the roux. YUM!!! Cheap but easy dining, especially on a cold winter day!!!"
474155,237001,2007-10-25,0,"Haven't tried this (yet!), but I have had a cheesecake crust using the duncan hines cake mix and oil method and it is really outstanding. Looks like a great basic cheesecake recipe - I'll be sure to try it."
61660,203903,2007-06-03,5,"Wonderful!!  This smells outstanding while grilling.  I hadn't eaten lamb in such a long time, and this was a great recipe to start with.  I grilled the lamb chops about 10 minutes per side (they were almost 2 inches thick).  I started out with them on foil so they didn't get really charred.  The marinade was simple to put together and I marinated for about 3 hours.  Thanks Julie!"
694088,236808,2008-09-23,4,These were soooooo good!  I couldn't stop eating them!  Awesome recipe that is easy and quick to make!
150281,42633,2010-07-30,5,Very good recipe! I started making it then remembered I had used all my cream cheese so I substituted goat cheese and it was still wonderful. The sauce was wonderful.
29196,15987,2002-06-02,5,"Funny how something so simple could knock your socks off!!
We had these for dinner tonight with a standing rib roast and other 'Zaar dishes, and these starred.
I couldn't get baby spinach so bought a bunch, cooked the garlic gently in the butter before the spinach went in, and added heaps of the black pepper. What a treat."
1802456771,50719,2014-02-05,5,"Just made these with frozen, half thawed, blueberries. Used an electric mixer to started but switched to hand mixing to fold in flour, milk, and berries. Dusted berries with 2 tbs of flour before folding into batter. In addition, I used a streusel topping of 1/4 cup each brown and white sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1/4 cup room temp butter, and 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon. This batch made 19  muffins in 2 cupcake pans (filled remaining cups with water). Used an ice cream scoop to measure batter and topped with streusel before baking. Took 30 minutes to bake at 375. Some factors to consider, muffin liners and room temp ingredients. These were such a hit that I was not allowed to gift them to the neighbors on a cold winter day. Thanks so much:)"
131674,204253,2008-05-11,5,"Loved the sweetness and the color of this rice.  I used seedless black raisins and served a curry on top.  Quite easy to do.  I just dumped all the ingredients in, brought the rice to a boil and turned down the heat and simmered for about 20 minutes.  Made for Photo Tag."
1372399,239768,2010-01-21,0,I did not care for this recipe. They did not flatten out like they were supposed too. They crumbled too easily. I made these cookies with another recipe and they worked out perfectly. Do not use this recipe!!
2664695,15846,2013-03-16,3,"I certainly WILL serve a big bowl of carrots, because my family is American Scotch-Irish (Google it). In fact, I will wear my orange tie in honor of William of Orange (google it). I corn the brisket myself, and cook it separate in 2/3 water and 1/3 Irish lager (Guinness is too bitter) with a fresh batch of the spices used for the corning. Carrots and onions are added to the cooking liquid, but these are not to be served with the meal. They will be strained out and discarded later. The meat, cooked well ahead of the serving of the meal is removed, rinsed in cold water wrapped in parchment paper and chilled in the refrigerator. The cooking liquid is strained and refrigerated. All this is done one day before service. On day of service, skim the hardened fat off the cooking liquid, put in the potatoes and bring to a boil. Cook until the potatoes are tender, and remove them, reserving the liquid. Add the trimmed carrots, and boil until tender. remove them, again reserving the liquid. Slice the cold beef, which will now slice neatly instead of shredding as it would if you tried to slice it cold, and fan the slices into an oven-proof baking or casserole dish. Add a cup of cooking liquid, cover with foil and warm in a 300f oven. Melt butter in an oven proof saucepan and swirl the potatoes in it, cover it, and put it into the oven with the meat. Glaze the carrots in a saucepan with honey and butter over very low heat.  Put the rest of the cooking liquid in a pressure cooker and bring to a rolling boil. Add wedges of cabbage, lid up, and bring to pressure. Cook only three minutes at pressure, then rapidly cool under cold water and remove the cabbage as soon as the lid can be removed. Serve everything. You did remember to make Irish Soda Bread, didn&#039;t you?"
1802672135,123503,2014-04-16,0,"simply can&#039;t get enough of this, I personally added fresh chopped baby bellas also known as crimini mushrooms to it, &lt;br/&gt;using the exact measurement as the canned, as well as the other chef&#039;s tip of adding worchister sauce, I added three tablespoons full and mixed well. I printed this off and it is going in my chef&#039;s box for keeping .I&#039;m eating it right now as we speak. Thanks to everyone for the base tips as well as the mixins I am so happy to have finally found it."
2000345801,418682,2015-07-18,5,"I made this because I had Velveeta cheese I was trying to get rid of. Boy, was it cheesy!! VERY GOOD! If you like Velveeta and like it cheesy, just cube up a big glob of Velveeta instead, you won&#039;t regret it! Lol..Will make again!!"
202661,42547,2005-04-26,5,"This is an incredible recipe.  I used Laura Scudder natural peanut butter which gave the fudge a little drier consistency, similar to Reese's Pnutbutter cups.  It was still very ""melt-in-your-mouth"", though. I have already printed out 4 copies of the recipe for my coworkers who went crazy for it. People look at this recipe like a magic potion.  It is unbelievable that these two ingredients can be so sublime together."
196038,8691,2008-07-22,4,Very good!
839962,168990,2011-07-11,5,"The Absolute BEST turkey I have ever tasted!!!  I wish I could give this recipe 10 Stars!  I completely agree with Beautiful Disgrace's review!  I was a little dubious about the cumin but, as usual, Kitten knows best!"
1421392,422034,2010-05-23,4,Very good!  Although the cheese did ooze out of the steaks when I cooked them.  Will try this recipe again!
58104,98849,2009-05-29,5,"Tender, moist, quick and so easy to make.My DH doesn`t like biscuits but these he did, having 3.  I did use butter in place of the shortening. Made for ZWT5 in this Menu #28651. Merci Beaucoup!"
256795,23244,2010-03-18,5,"Yum!  I really  liked this!  My hubby spiced his up, but that's pretty typical.  I did cut way back on the oil and increased the vinegar...yum!!"
67656,220402,2007-07-22,5,"I love making my own meatless burgers and thrilled to have this one in my collections.  The recipe is easy to prepare and the results are great. The flavors are big and bold and combine quite well together, you don't need much in the way of fixings  to send send your tastebuds zinging. My one quibble, and it is trivial, is that I would next time cut the cooked bulgur about 1/4 cup to get a firmer burger.  Admittedly, this may be my own fault as I used coarsely ground oats in lieu of breadcrumbs in order to keep this consistent with the WW Core program.  (PS, I made these in 1/2 hour, not 55 minutes so don't let the time stated stop you.)"
589394,212054,2007-12-15,5,This was REALLY GOOD!!! Used Chicken tenders so it made smaller chicken rolls but it was fast to prep! Just mixed diced green onions in the cream cheese...and used turkey bacon which turned out fine. The sauce on top was really good too.
128473,307568,2016-08-18,5,"Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe Lynn. The cookies were perfect. Crisp on the outside but light, tender and delicate on the inside. We loved them. Made for CQ3 - Greece"
65197,500602,2013-06-17,5,These patties are fabulous!!  I cut out the step of saut&eacute;ed onions and garlic (finely chopped they cooked during the baking time)  ....I tossed them in raw and added a 1/2 of minced jalapeno for just a little spice!  Very easy and delicious!
1360888,107570,2009-08-23,5,Excellent. I don't usually like sweet meats but the spiciness of the taco seasonings and salsa balanced the sweetness of the jam nicely.
566005,47391,2008-02-20,5,Very crispy & tasty.  My whole family loved it!  I divided the recipe & used only 1 lb of tilapia to serve 2 adults & 2 children.
494084,77585,2009-11-18,0,This is quite good!  I've never had the Olive Garden soup so I don't know how it compares but this is quite yummy.  It is really healthy too!  I wouldn't change a thing..next time I make it!  Thanks so much for the great recipe!
115302,329527,2016-01-25,5,"I wrote this review on the wrong recipe, so had to make an effort to let you know how much I enjoyed reading your into... Here is what I wrote:

plan to try this tonight, the stars are for your great intro and my anticipation of using your recipe and mine (Mother&#039;s Clam Chowder - Manhattan Style). She grew up in New York and talked about the FFM. Thank you for sharing all this!"
89831,31371,2007-09-12,5,"Delicious! I and added in some fresh garlic with the onion and threw in some Parmesan cheese at the end, so good, thanks hon!...Kitten:)"
357987,28768,2009-08-28,4,"I though this was an excellent Lasagna.  I only had half as much cheese as needed, and used crushed tomatoes since it was on hand.  The only reason I docked a star is because I thought it needed more seasoning and I did quite a few modifications.  I did let the sauce simmer the full hour, but added additional spices and a good healthy glug of red wine.  

The rest of the family, including the kids really enjoyed it.  Will be using this one again, but upping the spices!  

Thanks NurseDi!"
297913,389658,2012-02-07,4,"Good, simple, not too high in calories and fat.  I'll cut down on the mustard next time."
85826,36531,2008-08-06,5,"Yum. This was great. I put in some fresh thyme, just because we had some and added the dried oregano and it was very tasty. Thanks!"
270514,154576,2006-08-03,4,"Wonderful flavor.  Tastes just like the bread my grandma makes by hand.  Mine didn't rise very much, but I think it has something to do with high altitude and a not so warm kitchen.  Very easy to make.  Thanks!
UPDATE:  I finally figured out how to make the dough in my bread maker, then put in in a pre-warmed oven and let it rise.  Turned out GREAT!  DH ate almost half of it in the first hour it was out of the oven then made a sandwich for his own lunch for the next day!!  I will be making this bread on a weekly basis from now on.  Thanks so much!!!"
471185,29155,2007-04-08,5,I added 1tbsp vanilla extract and that was all!!! Very good recipe and I highly recommend it!
68460,125433,2005-09-29,4,"This was a really good casserole.  I halved the recipe,using 1 green and 1 yellow squash.  Make sure the squash and carrots are drained well or it'll be watery....I actually drained and then pressed down with a couple of paper towels to remove the excess moisture.  The Tabasco is a nice touch in this.  We enjoyed very much, thanks Jen!"
542159,445240,2011-01-06,5,"Wow! This one taste yummy, will not over flow the mug and is quick and easy. Fallowed the suggestion in the description for cutting down to one cake and am now looking forward to making again and next time think I will try Liszard's other suggestion of adding chocolate chips. You know I will be making this often. Thanks so much for the post."
53399,38446,2002-11-09,4,"Tasted great!  We doubled the recipe and had to add raspberry wine instead of sherry, but the raspberry didn't come out at all, it was just good!  Takes some time, but worth it for a weekend dinner."
27678,77497,2003-12-15,5,Sometimes simple pleasures are the best pleasures of all and this recipe definitely falls into that category for me. Using the freshest tomatoes you can find is important though. If you use the pale ones that appear in stores in the winter you'll wonder what the rest of us are raving about.
340130,173532,2008-01-05,4,"A good week night dish... healthy, tasty and easy. Thanks!"
58104,52803,2003-12-18,5,"So full of flavor. Any recipe that starts with a triology of onions, carrots, and celery you just know will be good. And then low in fat! Just yummy! I did have left over mushrooms that I used in this recipe. It was a mix of dried and fresh(Porcini, Button, Potabella,Lobster and Shitake)Thanks for a very rich tasting soup. Don`t skip the sherry it adds a wonderful richness to the soup.
"
485728,289490,2009-02-16,5,"These muffins were delicious.  I took your advice and didn't add any currants.  Also, I discovered halfway through making these that I was out of nutmeg, so I couldn't add any.  The muffins were delicious anyway though!  They were so moist and yummy.  Next time I will be sure to add the nutmeg since I am sure that will make them even better.  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!"
192478,38277,2005-02-04,4,"This was very good. As my brother-in-law said, it's great considering it's the middle of the week, meaning it wasn't a fancy gourmet dish but it tasted good and was easy to make. 
I would change the black olives to green or use capers near the end to give it a bit more zing. Black olives out of the can are just a little to bland for my taste."
594139,41694,2008-01-22,5,"Absolutley outstanding, I made a little differently as it is not the season for grilling. I cooked the pork whole not butterflied in the oven, sliced into thick slices and served over vegetable fried rice. The pork was still moist juicy and tender. The marinade was really full of flavour, I brought the left over marinade to a boil and drizzled it over the pork in the end. Everybody loved it and we all agreed definitely worthy of 5 stars. A for sure keeper thanks for sharing."
326830,129598,2006-07-05,5,"This recipe was great. I've tried many times to make this type of chicken, and it never came out right. This was perfect. Great taste.. just the right amount of sweet and spicy. Thanks for the great recipe."
927649,294131,2008-09-12,5,very flavorful snack. It reminds me of how my grandmother use to make it. It would be perfect for snacks or as a side to a salad. Very tastey
199418,17503,2008-06-15,5,"I've never tried strawberries with spinach before and was surprised at how yummy it was.  I did change a few things - used balsamic vinegar and olive oil (still used the sugar).  I also used green onions instead of onion flakes because I wanted to use them up.  I also added a little bit of babybel cheese and toasted walnuts, just because it sounded good."
927701,90059,2013-04-08,4,"I thought this was really good.  I liked the additions to jazz up plain brown rice.  I like that there isn&#039;t any butter or extra, unneeded fat added to it.  I added a little chopped onion and a dash of garlic powder.  I&#039;ll definitely make this again."
2001784533,102598,2017-11-09,5,"This marinade is my new go to. I made changes based on what I had on hand. Dried cilantro, didn't have fresh, lime juice bc I didn't have a lime, and regular beef broth. I did add cayenne bc we like spice as well. Best fajitas I've ever made at home."
645283,19042,2009-08-01,0,"These were soooo good.  I cut  red grapes in half and placed on top of the tomatoes. My friend is professional chef and he said the saltness and the sweet of the grapes made these perfect. I will be making these many many times.

498632,131893,2008-10-10,4,taste was great!
2275554,224061,2012-05-27,5,"I substituted the oil with applesauce and these were so wonderful that i had to leave a review, which i don't normally do. This recipe is a keeper!"
115184,16262,2003-11-29,5,"I made this for a party and it was an absolute hit.  I added a little seasoning and an egg to the meatballs just to help form them better, but other than that I wouldn't change the recipe one bit."
131674,34117,2009-09-15,5,I love cookies that start with a mix and end up tasting wonderful. These were so easy to put together and I used a jam that I had made that no one seemed to love.  Well they loved it in these cookies.  I served these with a fork as they are a soft cookie.  Thanks for sharing.
663997,234155,2009-07-23,5,"This is a great recipe.  I loved eating it at the restaurant.
Thanks for posting.

418210,97606,2007-01-08,5,"Thank you for this recipe.  As a college student, I didn't know the first thing about making gravy, but the whole house was impressed with this dish.  Super easy, cheap and delicious down-home cooking."
1331434,321948,2010-03-29,4,This was good. I did turn it back on to 500* for 5 min. per pound at the end to brown it some.
67976,88605,2005-06-15,5,These were FANTASTIC! We made them for a party and liked them so much we've made them several times since. THANKS for such a great recipe!
1065937,1423,2009-01-04,5,"Bless you, bless you for providing this recipe.  It is absolutely wonderful.  I have a story about this recipe.  I live in Seattle and for the last 15 years have eaten at a very popular restaurant who serves this very recipe.  It is very popular here, they make it fresh daily, sells for $5.00 a slice and it sells out all the time.  I have wanted the recipe for years, even asked the owner one day and she wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t give out her secret. I have searched apple crisp recipes for a long time and finally, today I have been successful.  I was so excited when I first tasted it and realized I found the right recipe that I was laughing and clapping in the kitchen.  Delicious, my favorite with fresh whip crÃÂ¨me, perfectly balanced, not over sweet.
Thank you so much!"
197023,265477,2009-01-17,5,"Love leeks, love apple in savoury dishes and just LOVED this soup.  I couldn't find calvados (but I shall continue looking for next time I make this) so I simply added some white wine.  I used a low-sodium chicken stock and low fat cream but otherwise made this exactly to the recipe.  Apart from having used three leeks and being determined to track down that calvados, I wouldn't want to change a thing in this recipe: a great balance of flavours and textures.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. Made for PRMR."
356130,74790,2006-10-31,5,yummy yummy pie
173314,28701,2007-09-13,5,"This is very good. I did use salsa and when browning ground beef I used 1 packet of taco seasoning.Added the salsa when I added the cheese soup.  Yummy, might serve over rice or with tortilla chips also."
169969,103637,2006-04-07,5,We really liked this salad! The apples and the cider vinegar and pepper really went well together! Thanks Barb!!
602659,384847,2010-10-28,5,I just made this for a potluck at work and everyone loved it. It was really good! I will be making it for thanksgiving. The only correction that I would make is to add brown sugar as well and to put a temperature of 375 to the instructions. You have to try it!
571308,11209,2009-11-07,5,"Simple and delicious. I made a few changes. I fried up a few slices of bacon, removed them, crumbed them and sauteed the onions, potatoes, leeks and fresh garlic in the fat. I then proceeded with the recipe as posted. When I was ready to serve, I sprinkled the bacon pieces on each bowl. Outstanding with so little effort! I served the soup with warm dinner rolls."
469983,56522,2010-06-18,3,"I liked this recipe- but I had a few problems with it. First I added the peppermint extract too early, and the whole shebang collapsed, then, on my second attempt, I added the sugar too late, and the whole thing collapsed. When I finally spooned it onto the sheet they looked kind of gross, but when they came out they tasted fine. So, thank you for this easy enough recipe. :)"
517298,169074,2007-12-18,5,"Easy and tasty.  I liked the marinade so much I have another batch going and am going to see what kind of jerkey it makes.  

I did use fermented fish sauce instead of soy as that is what I had on hand.  Served it with Bean Thread Noodles, various greens, thin carrot strips, and rice papers to make Vietnamese-like rice paper rolls served with a quick peanut sate sauce."
27564,243902,2009-01-09,5,"This was really good. I changed it up a little though. I used biscuit dough instead of cornflakes and colbyjack instead of cheddar because that is what I had on hand, and I skipped the rice. I am going to tinker with this to make it less fattening - like using egg beats and 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup."
146029,107476,2005-06-29,5,"Truly wonderful though much more time consuming than ""normal"" scrambled eggs.  I have since tried a ""diet"" version by using 2% milk instead of cream, cooking spray instead of butter and replacing the 3 eggs with 1 egg + 100 mL of liquid egg whites (the stuff that comes in a carton).  Admittedly, the original recipe is creamier and more luxurious, but even the diet version was tasty  (better than conventional scrambled eggs).  Thanks for a great recipe!!!"
17803,458715,2012-03-18,5,"As the title says, this is a colorful, delicious health salad.  I've never had any type of apple in my salad before.  A granny smith apple, is the perfect addition for this salad and I think for any lettuce salad you would make.  From now on any lettuce salad I make a granny apple is going into it.  Made for Best of 2011 Cookbook Official Game"
122878,109861,2007-08-02,3,"This recipe made for a tasty chicken and dumplings with very clear instructions. I used all the lised ingredients except I didn't add the peas (didn't have them) and instead of making a rue to add for thickening, I made a simple milk and flour mixture and added that to the hot stew for the same purpose.  Also, I felt it was a bit too watery tasting so I added chicken boullion granules to pump up the flavor and it turned out very good.  I used more celery than called for and added about 1/2 cup of finely chopped onion.  I prepared and added Bisquick dumplings to the stew as well.  The selected spices and amounts was perfect, I used what was specified in the ingredients.  Thank you ms. muffet for a providing a nice recipe that my family enjoyed for dinner this evening."
812499,296573,2008-04-08,5,"Great taste, especially for those of us who are meat lovers, this almost satisfies that urge.  

Freezing the patties ahead of time is good for just the wife and I when no one else is eating at the house.  

We are going to double everything next time.  JB"
25792,54702,2003-03-06,5,Rita...OMG sooo easy with the premade dough.  Left out the raisens and topped with a cream cheese frosting.  BF thought he moved in with Mrs. Cinnabon......TY from both of us!
448933,81047,2008-03-28,5,"I stayed true to a vegetarian dish. I didn't use a crock pot though, instead I cooked it on the stove. It cooked for the same amount of time at a simmer. Served it to my vegetarian friend and she loved it!"
233588,73634,2006-09-11,5,"I made the ""full fat"" version from The Barefoot Contessa cookbook.  The flavor of this tart is lovely, it's like a lighter version of pumpkin pie with the subtle flavorings of banana and orange zest.  It's a wonderful tart, I would highly recommend making either version."
1230619,83464,2009-04-08,5,This is SO GOOD! I even skipped the sauce for my boyfriend's low sugar diet and it still came out amazing. All the veggies are so good together! I will definitely have to make this again!!
199848,370417,2009-05-26,5,A nice sweet dessert without any guilt.  I used fat free vanilla yogurt and it worked well.  I skewered chunks of pineapple and canteloupe.  It's quite kid-friendly.  Thanx for a cool healthy dessert!
341519,54134,2010-02-07,5,I loved it!
2001141541,291700,2016-08-25,5,actually the most delicious things! packed with flavour. everyone adored them. wrote the recipe out and will use again :D
107583,396895,2012-08-12,5,"Been making a chocolate self-saucing pudding for years, so was intrigued by a lemon version.  Glad I tried it.  Very good and very easy to make.  I am thinking maybe a lime version would also be good?  Thanks, Pat!"
215956,217492,2007-03-25,3,"I made this dish using boneless, skinless chicken breasts - I couldn't find pearl onions at my local grocery so I used about 1 cup of chopped yellow onion that I sauted in a little olive oil.  After that I added the sauce ingredients.  I cut the salt back to 1 tsp and I also cut the pepper back to 1 tsp.  The pepper still overpowered the dish.  I would definitely take the pepper down to 1/2 tsp next time.  I also omitted the bacon.  I served it with whole wheat egg noodles and roasted veggies.  It's defintely a keeper - DH liked it too."
168158,85916,2005-07-29,5,"Made this for DH during a romantic stay at a B & B.  I prepared it in advance, marinating for over 24 hours and was SO delicious! Definitely grill this over charcoal - we grilled the leftovers marinated beef on our gas grill and they weren't nearly as good. "
1803116783,353720,2015-10-27,5,"Delicious. Will definitely be making this again, whenever I see short ribs on sale. I followed the recipe (ingredients and method) to the letter this time. Next time, will do the slow simmer part in the crockpot."
101661,63878,2003-08-29,5,"Congratulations Bill... you're one of the few people here that actually know how to make a good chicken soup! The herbs are particularly important. This could still be improved by using chicken on the bone, browned, and then simmered in water to make your own stock instead of the canned stuff. You will notice a much cleaner flavor."
106624,102203,2005-10-16,5,"This is a very good soupper soup.  I made it using two hot sausages because I didn't have any ham in the freezer, also used frozen chopped spinach  It worked out fine, next time I make this I will use the fresh spinach and and I bet it will rate a ten.  Thanks for the new recipe."
1802856090,60085,2014-06-25,5,It&#039;s really amazing.. It&#039;s easy to make and tasty!!! I added paprika powder 1 tsp and half cup of grated parmesan also 1 tsp dijon mustard...
71219,14532,2003-02-20,3,"A little on the dry side, I used a pork tenderloin.  The sauce is sweet and tangy all at the same time, but it couldn't hide dried out meat. This recipe might be more suited to a fattier piece of pork. I am using the leftovers sliced very thin with Open Pit BBQ sauce - nice firm textured meat with a bit of spice."
632249,25370,2010-01-26,5,Quick and delicious. I did reduce the butter to 2 Tablespoons plus 1 Tablespoon of olive oil and that was more than enough for us. The seafood does release a lot of juice as well so there is plenty of liquid in the finished dish. I used dill in place of parsley (personal preference) and I threw in some shrimp for extra colour. Thanks for sharing this simple recipe JerriLea.
84438,35004,2003-10-11,5,"My family and I went camping last weekend and I made this bean dish. Very delicious and hearty. Call me crazy, but I think cooking them in a cast-iron dutch oven over an open fire added to the flavor, too. Thanks Nurse Di. Will make again."
37449,87058,2004-09-07,5,This was so good! I served this over MizzNezz's Ultimate Brownies and it made a delicious topping. It was very creamy. Thanks Harley Princess!
2001177335,186845,2018-11-03,5,This recipe was absolutely delicious I will definitely make again. Couple little tweaks first of all doing low carb so I only used 8 oz of salsa increase the chicken stock to a cup and a half cut down on the cook time to about 4 minutes when you add shrimp and scallops. Husband loved it!
1898402,15839,2011-04-30,4,4 1/2 stars IF you add TWO cans of crab meat instead. (I used Clover Leaf crab meat).<br/>Also used 8 ounces and omitted the mushrooms. <br/>Turned out REALLY great. Family agreed that we dont have to go to Jack's anymore! Hahaha!<br/>Thanks for the recipe!
448510,156595,2008-09-25,0,"I made this rapidly in five minutes before dinner, after I realised I had run out of bottled dressing! It turned out perfectly, thick and creamy, and so easy to make with ingredients you always have!  I will be making fresh dressing from now on! I don't like anchovies so I was pleased not to have to add them!"
2000202568,82102,2017-11-08,5,"This is just so easy for such great results. My grocery store sells Foster Farms &quot;Thin Cut Breasts&quot; which just are great - my boys don't enjoy thick, juicy breasts (yet ;) - they cook perfectly at 35 minutes. I would think you could totally prepare these early in the day and let them sit in the fridge until ready to bake - not sure, so let me know if anyone tries that. Thumbs up in our family!"
51011,121066,2005-06-17,5,"To think- I thought this was my secret, special recipe... Anyway- Thanks for sharing.  I have never measured the ingredients, so yours tastes wayyyyyyy better.  We will have this often."
284897,334220,2010-03-20,5,"I really enjoyed this recipe.
It is so easy to prepare, and I followed most of the recipe exactly, the one and only thing I did that was different was to peel the zucchini, and the only reason for that was because my zucchini were so large and the skins were a little tough. I used a combination of yellow and green zucchini and used my own homemade chciken stock for this recipe. Ummmm I also did have some before refrigeration time to blend, awesome. I had it with toast for lunch....but just one bowl!!!!
The rest in now in the fridge waiting, although I don't think it can get much better than what I have already had for lunch!
This soup was smooth and creamy and so delcious . 
A great way to use my overgrown zucchini. 
I think with, what soupI have left, I will get enough for another 3 bowls of soup, although I have had one bowl as I stated and that was quite a large bowl, so if I used smaller serving bowls I would get more for sure.
Will make this one again, its so easy and has such wonderful flavours.
Thanks mersaydees, great recipe."
642310,125735,2010-01-24,1,"I was really excited about making this.  I followed the recipe exactly, but they came out terrible.  The crust was soggy and the topping was flat.  With so many great reviews though, I may just have to try it again."
177083,17126,2009-06-21,5,"This was great and very quick to pull together!  I used only half the tomatoes that were in my can, but all of the juice (hubby doesn't care for tomatoes).  It still tasted great to me.  Right before serving I also chopped 2 green onions and about a 1/4 cup of cilantro, mixed it up well, then topped with the cheese as suggested.  Thanks for a great recipe!"
228569,81347,2006-07-12,5,"My whole family loved this cake. I agree that it is somewhat like a bread, but it seemed lighter to me..."
137404,44644,2004-04-13,3,"I thought that this recipe looked easy and delicious.  It was neither.  The cubesteaks didn't stay together well in the pan, despite three toothpicks in each, and the stuffing kept falling out.  It was also difficult to get them done all the way through.  I'm a novice chef, and maybe I took on more than I could handle.  Anyway, they tasted pretty good (not delicious, though).  They were a little salty and a little tough.  Maybe I'll try again and see if I do a better job.  "
199902,10664,2005-08-08,5,"This was a fantastic and VERY easy dessert.  I crumbled the oreos for the top layer instead of leaving them whole, and then I drizzled some hot fudge on top before freezing. I'll be making these again!  Thanks!"
268313,42861,2009-05-15,5,This is the recipe my Nana has been making for us for as long as I can remember and it is my absolute favourite! Easy and delicious every time!
162888,103957,2005-09-04,4,"I took these to a party last night and everyone enjoyed them.  I did find them a little dry, meaning that they crumbled when bit into it, and they had a really strong cheese flavor.  All in all, this is a great recipe,both tasty and easy to prepare, and I will be making these again !!"
325154,22206,2009-06-23,5,"These are very good. Made these to take as healthy snacks for a family road trip. I only used a 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 whole egg (didn't have a use for 2 yolks), sprayed the pan with PAM and used a combo of dried fruits. Will individually wrap them for our trip and along with some other snacks will hopefully avoid the costly and unhealthy snacks at the roadside stops! Thanks for posting."
424680,297229,2008-05-03,5,"This is soup pretty much the way my own grandmother used to make it ~ Real comfort food! I halved the recipe, used lemon pepper instead of the usual S&P, then served it with thick slices of multigrain bread! WONDERFUL SOUP, & the recipe is a keeper! [Made & reviewed for one of my adopted chefs in this Spring's PAC]!"
468149,175837,2007-03-27,4,"I gave this a 4 only because it lacked some spice, other than that it was right on."
844554,446651,2011-04-14,5,This is so-o-o good! I followed exactly and wouldn't change a thing. I used the make ahead method where you bake it in the oven. Turned out great. Made for Zaar Newest Tag Game 2011.
177435,172555,2008-06-10,4,I like the flavors in this but I don't think I added enough basil and parsley it was kinda oily. I will definately make again just will tweak it. made for ZWT4.
653438,119417,2009-12-20,5,Made these for lunch today.  I followed the directions except to cut it in half.  I used a whole egg and a little more cracker crumbs and coated them in  panko crumbs.  Fabulous!!!  DH said to make these again and he was never real excited about salmon patties.  Thank you.  Served on a bed of greens but used the tarter sauce on top.  LOVED that also!
2000551256,270092,2016-03-13,0,"I helped my mother make these cookies 100s of times. This is not a authentic Hungarian recipe. We never used cream cheese we used butter. To make a flaky dough we would roll out the dough, lather it with crisco kneed  then fold it over cover and refrigerate till firm and repeat the steps 4-5 times, this makes a delicious flakey pastry. Hungarians did not use cream cheese! They didn&#039;t have it. All butter. Try it you will love it."
362734,32204,2007-03-04,5,WOW are these chocolatey! I doubled the batch in a 9x13 pan sprinkling the top with 1 cup chopped pecans and 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips. It took 35 minutes to bake. I don't see a reason to ever buy a brownie mix again. I always have these ingredients on hand. What a simple and delicious recipe! Thanks!
2695,152453,2007-07-20,5,absolutely wonderful.  tonight will be the third time we've made these ribs and each time they get better.  we're addicted.  thanks for the recipe Pokey!
498487,289399,2008-05-05,3,"These aren't bad, but they kind of taste ""healthy"" if you know what I mean. The topping is tangy, like plain yogurt, even though I add 2/3 cup powdered sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla. I think I'll try vanilla yogurt next time and see how it does. I don't taste the espresso powder at all and will either double it next time or omit it all together. I also found these a little dry so will likely add another egg and a little more oil. This is an interesting cupcake and I plan to make it again and see if I can get it to work better. I'll update my review then"
58104,12134,2005-10-16,5,Tender and flavorful! My DS that won`t eat pork chops had this! And that says a lot! he does like onions so that may have helped! I did add an apple to the onions. Thanks for a great recipe!
71421,87085,2004-09-14,5,"Had 1&1/3 lb. beef so increased the chili p. to 2t, omitted the cumin and used elbows instead of spag.
Came out great . . . thanks !"
2001479236,168157,2017-04-09,5,"I made this for my family last night and it got rave reviews. The only tips I might add are to use smaller lamb sharks as the flavor is better and cooking time slightly less. Also, after cooking I strained the juices and veggies from the roasting pan and thickened with cornstarch as recipe suggested. The end sauce was a little gray and dull for my taste so I added two large tbsp of tomato paste with the cornstarch and it perked right up."
64625,21886,2008-09-11,5,"This soup delivers. Easy and fast to prepare, and it simmered for an hour while I had to go out. I came back and supper was done. I added to this wonderful lineup of ingredients a medium-large size potato, diced chunky, and a left over zucchini, diced, and used vegetable bouillion instead of beef.  It makes a lot! Great! There's more for another day! Thanks for posting, Manda."
37779,23414,2002-09-27,5,This was a great quick and easy supper for us. I adjusted things just a little for my family's taste. I added about 1 t. minced garlic to brown with the meat. I used 1 T. chili powder and 1 t. pepper. I was in and out of the kitchen fast and on to better things. Thanks Inez.
167225,108780,2005-02-13,0,"I think I didn't cook the beans quite enough at the beginning. They never really mushed enough to make this paste rather than just sweetened beans. This was still an improvement over the last time I tried to make this stuff with a different recipe - that time, I scorched the beans and had to throw them out. This recipe very clearly explains to you how not to do that. I don't have a kitchen scale, so I used 1 1/2 cups of beans - nothing else is really measured precisely, so it seemed like the technique rather than the proportions were important here. Then I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar, but I found that adding more when suggested got the stuff a little closer to paste texture. I have discussed this recipe with the poster and she said she made it again recently and it did work for her, so I would encourage other people to try it. The first time I tried adzuki bean paste, I never would have guessed that I would end up trying to make it at home, but now I seem to have acquired a taste for it. I also like that it seems to me to be more filling than many other desserts."
149363,229528,2007-07-03,5,"Oh we loved this recipe! It was a great way to use up those leftovers too!
I used brown rice and a Creole Seasoning that I had on hand here, then topped it with fresh chopped chives from my garden.
It was terrific!!
Made for ZWT 3 :)"
217482,276555,2008-01-06,5,"I have to admit, I did alter this recipe a lot, I didn't use buttermilk, but dipped chook in eggs and then rolled in flour.

Then I prepared the glaze, added the chook to a baking pan, and poured the glaze over and baked in the oven 1/2 hour."
790231,387638,2009-09-07,4,Good.  Easy.  I added 3 cloves of garlic into the sauce and some cayenne into the meatballs.  Wouldn't fit into a 9 X 9 but a 9 X13 didn't cover the meatballs with sauce. I only cooked 45 minutes and it needed the full 60 for the rice to be cooked properly.  Otherwise had a good flavor..............Thanks for posting.
173838,40015,2005-01-23,5,"I loved this easy to prepare, delicious, kid-friendly dish!  I enjoyed the sauce over brown rice too. I halved the recipe and it worked great for 2 chicken breasts  and 4 chicken legs, with extra to spoon over rice.  My eleven-year old daughter was slightly skeptical about the sauce, but after one bite, asked for an extra spoonful over her rice.  Thanks, Lubie, for this keeper!"
169430,216544,2007-03-19,4,"I enjoyed this couscous. I skipped adding the butter just to save fat and didn't miss it at all, there was plenty of flavor from the broth. The almonds are lovely but I thought that the orange was very under pronounced then I looked at the recipe again and saw that it ask for TBS's not tsp's, oops. Topped with a sprinkle of cinnamon this was very nice indeed."
61574,85625,2005-03-27,5,This is so easy and the best dressing I have ever had on fruit
146742,456847,2011-05-27,5,"I'm pleased to be the first to review your recipe. I think it's a keeper. It's a great recipe for pork chops that I always have in the freezer. I get tired of fixing them the same old way and this is a new one for me and a nice change.   I followed the recipe as written, and served them over spaetzle, #1280021.  I will be making this quite often in the future.  Thanks for posting it."
121985,100533,2004-10-06,5,"This was very easy to make and tasted like it took much longer!  I've never made minestrone soup before but i love to eat it!  I replaced the zucchini with yellow squash, navy beans and regular canned chicken broth.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  I served it with some crusty garlic bread but i would really like to try this in a bread bowl next time around, topped with some parmesan cheese.  Thanks for the easy recipe, I'll be making this one again! "
236292,66984,2005-11-13,5,"Excellent gravy, and easy to make with simple ingredients already on hand. I used Baby Bella mushrooms and a nice Pinot Noir. It was sublime. Thanks for a great recipe that I will most certainly use over and over!"
27348,15932,2002-01-02,5,"This is so easy and yummy.  I used store bought caramel sauce.  Next time, I will make my own."
107583,194805,2007-06-04,5,"What great muffins!  Just the right amount of sweet and cinnamon ( I cut the recipe in half, and used 1 cup of Splenda and only 1/2 cup sugar).  I had a brain-f* * t and forgot to put baking powder in, but they still rose nice and high.  I added extra walnut pieces on top before baking.  Thanks for posting this keeper!  Made for ZWT  III"
37106,16432,2003-01-26,5,Oh my now I know what all the fuss is about! Made these for the super bowl. I did use french bread but to size the grill but add all the other ingredients and also a few banana peppers before grilling. It came out crunchy and simply delicious. I cute the portions down to finger type sandwiches. Definitely a big hit!
2002304312,393523,2018-10-17,0,"I did this recipie tonight and was delish. I didn't use full pkg of ranch but did add ramano cheese with parm cheese. Real, not cheap cheese. Even my husband critic liked it a lot!!!"
1304040,42169,2012-07-26,5,Hubby loved these tasty guys!  Served with a pasta alfredo...good combination!  Will definitely make this for him again soon!
198940,51676,2005-05-30,5,Yummy!! My family loved this recipe. I will definately make it again.
256795,256283,2010-05-03,5,"WOW, WOW!!  DELISH!!  My DH gave this an 8 1/2, which is a huge compliment from him!!  :O)  The only thing I did different was to serve it over polenta~~#47663.  My husband also drizzled extra balsamic vinegar over it all.  Thanks so much for sharing!!  :O)  UPDATE:  I have since veganized this, and it is still awesome!!  I use some of the Tofurkey sausages (sun-dried tomato and basil) and also threw in some Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo.  Instead of rosemary, I used basil since the sausage had basil.  The chorizo adds some spiciness, and it's just delish!  Bet some meat-eaters would never guess!  :O)  Thanks again!"
1191355,471779,2012-01-12,2,Not the best.  I modified and used breast meat to lessen the fat.  Also used a lite beer.
343228,329139,2009-10-04,5,"Another winner by Acadia!!!
We loved this.  I used home made spaghetti meat/mushroom sauce. and It was amazing. I'm a huge egg plant fan so this was right down my ally. Next time i think i might try it with those min inch long eggplants and serve as appetizer over salad. 
Made for Ramadan tag 2009"
356062,172565,2007-03-31,5,Wow I did not except these to be this easy and good! I had a bunch of left over tomatoes so this dish fit the bill. My mother claim to dislike tomatoes but she ate the most out of all of my family! I used a lot of garlic because I like garlic on everything basiclly.... and My family is not a big basil fan tho so I went lightly on that. This is a def. make again!
1113882,3092,2009-10-30,5,"I love this recipe! I will make it again next year, but with red jello (had orange already) and a taller container. I used a rolling pin to get the worms out of the straws and it worked perfectly. Make sure to use a narrow and tall container!"
1886454,331918,2013-04-13,3,Really good cookies but you cannot taste the amaretto at all. I added a splash almond extract to both the dough and the filling and then they were everything I wanted!
61660,277527,2008-04-03,5,"Terrific sandwich!  We made these for dinner last night and it was a wonderful quick recipe.  I couldn't find asiago cheese rolls so I used ciabatta rolls instead.  I was able to find a pack of gourmet italian meats that Culinary Explorer talked about.  They were sliced very slim and we sampled each one first, lol, and enjoyed them all.  This is definately a flavorful sandwich.  Made for the PRMR tag game."
2001740870,472730,2017-10-05,0,"I've been wanting this for a while. Everyone says it's very easy too make, Hope it comes out good. Making it sometime next week Wish me luck . :)"
225372,31230,2005-12-04,5,"Okay, I was totally freaking out because the dough was really crumby and the biscotti burnt, but luckily I persevered, because I managed to rescue them and produce fantastic tasting biscotti! Too fiddly for me, but if ever stuck in on a rainy day I'd like to try diff. variations"
1262231,167593,2009-05-08,5,"Thank you so much for posting this.  My mother has the same Betty Crocker book and gave me the recipe, but I lost it before I got to make it.  I did a search hoping I'd find it and here it is!  This is awesome with fresh cole slaw, and even better is the pulled pork sandwiches the next day -- IF there's any left.  It makes your house smell  yummy, too."
131126,371218,2009-05-21,5,This was a tasty & easy version of paella.  I made it a true skillet dinner & sauted chunks of chicken breast in the first step. I served with a salad & bread.  Nice meal!
4439,107464,2006-03-16,5,"OMG!!! This is heaven!!! I could have eaten this gooey, chocolate wonderful thing by myself. I used Milky Way Bars and macademia nuts and semi swee chocolate chips, it was beyond incredible!!!!"
427184,137143,2011-12-28,0,"Excellent! I left it in the fridge overnight and it kept rising. Delicious, thanks!"
554666,183081,2012-07-01,5,AMAZING! I could not stop eating it when I got it out of the oven. I followed as everyone suggested to cut the oil  and sugar to 3T. Simply wonderful. My husband couldn't stop raving about these burger buns. Looks like we are no longer buying our buns. Thank you for a great recipe.
58038,69298,2008-07-22,4,Love how easy this is to get to the table.  I made 1/2 recipe and added some minced garlic.  We thought it had too much butter - was swimming in it.
1157973,80536,2012-01-23,2,"The beef came out tender and it was flavorful, but not at all to our taste. It is very, very sweet, overpoweringly so, really."
37688,108522,2005-10-24,5,"I know there are so many reviews of this simply wonderful recipe but I just had to add how much I loved it. I used regular Kraft original mayonaise and 2 cheddar cheese slices and for me it has to be white bread.  The end result is an almost crunchy outside texture that turns golden brown, with that soft gooey cheese oozing out.  It doesn't really taste like mayonaise once cooked, just an added zing.  Ahhh I'm in heavan."
560491,393952,2009-12-06,4,"This was good and tasted just like a bacon cheeseburger.  Made as directed, but only made half.  I sprinkled sesame seeds on with the egg-wash step for an added garnish.  Made for Everyday is a Holiday Nov/Dec 09."
870955,8409,2008-08-31,4,"Very tasty! We only made the rasberry layer, and we added a bit of maple syrup instead of sugar. Delicious!"
934824,287338,2009-01-29,5,"Very good!!!! Followed recipe exactly, came out perfect!"
37779,62136,2004-02-11,5,Zucchini is one of my very favorite veggies. This turned out better than I expected. I prepared this similar to BothFex. I did without the oil altogether. I also sprinkled each topping ingredient on separately and didn't use the cream. I wish I had doubled the recipe and will next time. Very tasty and easy to make. Thanks Kim.
37602,21540,2002-04-20,0,Just reading it I think I'll try and add flavour by susbstituting maple syryp for the sugar (blends well too) and adding lime zest and juice.  Have tried those with other raspberry dishes and it's a good combo.
608966,100727,2011-01-17,5,These were the BEST I've ever made!
125416,225645,2011-05-19,5,I made this recipe to take along on a picnic--It was excellent!  Plus I loved that I didn't have to worry about keeping it refrigerated.  I added some chinese pea pods for a little more color.  Will definitely be making again (especially during the summertime).  Thanks for a great recipe!
425008,11107,2007-11-29,2,I thought these noodles were just ok. They were a bit too salty for my taste.
261344,275334,2009-08-04,5,"My aunt has made these my whole life, we call them ""addicta-bars"".  Once you start you can't stop.  They are delicious.  I was thrilled to find a recipe that reminded me of my childhood.  I love these.  I actually mixed about 6oz each of the chocolate and butterscotch chips and then just spread it like frosting and allowed to chill for about 30 minutes before I cut them.  YUMMY!"
455641,344759,2010-01-03,5,"We loved this tea. Very light and delicious, and lightly sweet. The mint flavor was just great, I love mint, and I can't wait to try this again, maybe with a different juice too. Tanks for sharing this! Made for the PARTY tag event."
1271506,447471,2012-07-20,5,"Really nice and peppery!  Only marinated 1-1/2 pounds (four thighs) since just for the two of us, so not sure whether the amount of marinade would work for as much chicken as you suggest, but it sure was tasty!  We did modify it somewhat, in that we parboiled the chicken first, then marinaded, and then grilled it to perfection.  Definitely will be making it again -- thanks!"
363055,152207,2008-12-27,5,This is sooooooooo good!  Used frozen tomatoes from my garden.  Will make this again!
108902,55609,2008-02-03,5,"Like other reviewers, I can't believe I actually made these! They're delicious and easy and I followed the recipe step by step. Thanks, Bev, I won't be buying store bagels ever again."
318235,16855,2010-10-20,5,"So easy and very tasty. I used Bay Scallops and served as a side dish to gnocchi. Wonderful, thank you very much!"
329638,26370,2011-01-27,0,"I've never been a fan of non-boxed-mix cakes before, because they generally didn't turn out very good.  But this..this is my new go-to for chocolate cake!  I baked in 9"" round, then split each layer (to end up with four layers).  The bottom three layers each were pricked with a fork and brushed with a little chocolate syrup and then filled with Whipped Chocolate Cream Icing, which was used to ice the top and sides as well.  Topped with a few chocolate curls and a drizzle of chocolate syrup, I thought we'd died and gone to heaven.  This got rave reviews too...thanks so much for posting.  I'm off to make another one right now!"
30382,256844,2012-03-19,5,Actually this is not the same recipe as Giada de Laurentis'.  Her recipe has an additional 1/2 cup of butter.  I have made her recipe too and prefer this recipe.  They are just as tender and tasty without the additional 1/2 c. of butter.  Served them tonight as an improptu desert with a little vanilla ice cream for a small group of friends and they were a big hit.  Do not over bake and I used frozen Minute Maid lemon juice - just like fresh and no zest.
803511,298208,2008-07-27,0,I clipped this too and ran across it while going through my recipe file.  I was going to get it put on Zaar but you beat me to it!  I can't wait to try it this week and I will keep in mind your adaptions.  Thanks for sharing this.  I think it could be quite popular!
199848,31462,2014-06-10,5,"I enjoyed these eggplant little stacks.  They make a pretty presentation, too.  I only cooked mine for about 10 minutes, so the eggplant slices wouldn&#039;t be too soft.  The fresh basil is a must - don&#039;t skip it!  Thanx!"
37449,88036,2005-07-06,4,"This is the first time I have ever made lentil salad, and it won't be the last! This was a nice, mild salad that I enjoyed. I used balsamic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. Thanks for posting! :)"
265956,188439,2010-03-23,5,This is the only way I will eat meatloaf. I lost my recipe and its been a while since I made it. I am so happy to have found it. Thanks for posting! This is a MUST try recipe if you don't really care for meatloaf.
589729,51596,2007-12-30,5,"Great. Family loves it and I love not giving them all the added sodium and preservative found in the store bought variety. I actually like the flavors in this better than the real thing. I did however make slight modifications for the kids. I used yellow instead of spicy mustard, and eliminated the chili powder.I also used ground turkey. All worked well. Thanks for the posting."
2751053,338632,2013-03-24,5,"Fantastic!  My favorite way to eat green beans.  Been making this for years, but with the addition of a spoon of grated cheese.  Great flavor."
225021,72983,2006-07-05,5,"Delicious and so quick! The only thing I didn't have was hoisin sauce. First I forgot to add the sesame oil, but it was even very good without that. I halved the amount because the sauce is just for me. I enjoyed the first batch with (hot) Asian noodles. I still have plenty of sauce left and will eat it with an Asian ""on a stick"" recipe. Can't wait! Thank you Ev for another GREAT recipe. This one is a keeper."
158086,44087,2010-12-27,5,This was one of the favorites of the night...everyone loved it...
1027388,13901,2010-02-02,4,"wow! i was so absolutely certain when i got to the simmering stage that this was going to taste terrible. how wrong i was! delicious and so damn easy to make. i mean, it's essentially stock and spinach - so if you don't like them then stay away, but if you do then get amongst it!"
165933,99481,2014-07-31,5,"DH says that the lowly zucchini finally deserves praise!  I thinly sliced a zucchini and two small yellow squash I had in the fridge.  I did remember to deseed them, however, i forgot to peel them.  The dish turned out fantastic!  i think I&#039;d like to add some raisins next time.  Thanks"
424680,41230,2008-11-13,5,"Although I followed the recipe pretty much, I did cut back the amount of red chile by about 2/3! I also used the more moist, chewy Medjool dates & came up with A GREAT TASTING CHUTNEY, & one I'll make again! Thanks for adding to my growing number of chutney recipes! [Tagged, made & reviewed as part of my Chutney theme in My-3-Chefs]"
446143,203646,2008-04-09,5,Oh so good and EASY.  We added tomatoes and a bit of cheese to our wraps.  I also used chopped turkey breast (from a roast).  DH and I enjoyed 2 each for dinner.  Thanks!
950586,121941,2008-09-16,5,"I have been on a search for the perfect white bead and I FOUND it here!  This bread tastes so good!  It's not too yeasty tasting or too sweet.  I followed the recipe exactly and opted to use the shortening.  This bread is so versatile.  It's perfect plain, but we are having fun experimenting with toppings and fillings.  I've made it free form and in a loaf pan.  It worked great both.  Used for toast, sub sandwiches, garlic bread.  It's really easy to make, even though it may not seem like it due to rise time being so lengthy.  A beginner could make this work.  Please, do yourself a favor and make this bread."
2000833103,507176,2016-01-22,5,"This recipe is AWESOME! I made it with a few slight variations, and got some seriously delicious results. First, I made the &quot;brownies&quot; in a 9x13 cake pan, because I wanted them to be a bit thicker (if you do this, you MUST add on some extra bake time - I did about 10 minutes). I also halved the icing recipe (less surface area to cover...also I&#039;m not an icing girl, so a thinner coat is desirable to me). Finally, I chopped some extra walnuts and sprinkled them in the icing. I got rave reviews from everyone who tasted...even my tough to impress mother! Will definitely be making this again! YUM!!!"
2637904,33919,2013-01-17,5,"Another hit with my family and disappeared fast!  Comments I got were to maybe switch it up and next time try adding a topping of fresh tomatoes, lettuce, and cheddar after it's cooked and instead of the flour tortillas, use broken taco shells for more of a taco version.  Definitely will make again, will probably have to make two when we are all home."
2205672,496591,2013-03-15,5,This looks amazing!
171198,43065,2005-01-05,5,I made these for Christmas gifts 2004 and they were a big hit. Everyone that I gave them to loved them. They are soft and chewy and have a great carmel buttery taste. 
419850,179429,2009-07-16,5,My husband is Italian and his grandmother makes the best spaghetti and meatballs. He usually doesn't like anyone else's spaghetti but he loves this one! In fact my whole family likes this one! Since finding this recipe there is no more spaghetti sauce out of a jar in my house. This recipe is quick and easy and has so much more taste than those jared sauce! I use baby bella mushrooms in my sauce and add Italian sausage into the meat mix.
66549,48282,2004-01-07,5,This was a hit.  I already had an oversized martini glass and served the cocktail sauce in a small martini class.  Very easy and tasty appetizer w/ a great appearance.  
604906,278221,2009-10-16,5,"Made this for dinner, it was delicious. I added chopped celery with the onion, subbed evap. milk for the heavy cream, cheddar for the mozzarella, and bow ties for the angel hair. I also browned boneless chicken breast halves and put them on top because I didn't have any leftover chicken. Definately will make this again."
679625,165726,2013-01-16,3,"The texture is wonderful. Made this soup according to recipe. It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. A little tweaking with Liquid Smoke, Penzey's Northwoods Seasoning, or perhaps Broth instead of Water? Love the 78 calories per cup."
114522,7763,2007-11-08,5,Very good recipe. My husband loved it. Thank you.
173314,33671,2008-06-29,0,delicious enjoyed with some baked broccoli casserole.... will make often.... thank you
681091,31717,2010-01-23,5,"This is the soup I always get at Olive Garden and I could tell absolutely no difference in my homemade and theirs.  The recipe does make a lot, and filled my large crock pot to the brim.  I didn't mind, it is even better the next day.  Thanks for the recipe, it will be used often!"
61569,96475,2008-01-27,4,I made these last night and they were very good with burgers. I increased the salt a bit to give it more taste per reading reviews. I am planning on having these again with our leftover burgers but find them heavier and dense today after sitting out one day. If these buns were a bit more lighter in texture would be better. Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe.
768828,106395,2013-08-28,5,Loved this  I used some frozen filets that had been in the freezer too long so wanted something to cover up the slight fishy taste.  The fish were really watery even though I pressed them with paper towel but still really good.  This would be awesome with fresh fish.
239758,288686,2008-12-10,5,"A wonderful and easy-to-make pasta dish. I was just a tad short of tomatoes and pine nuts, but that didn't seem to matter. Also used kalamata olives in place of nicoise. Didn't need to add any pasta water. I'll be making this often in future. It's great for a divine, on-the-table-in-a-hurry dinner. Served with a salad and Recipe #164304. Yummo!"
39301,162488,2006-10-15,5,I love Giada's cooking and have been making these for a while now.  Definitely use proscuitto - regular ham just wouldn't be the same!  I've also lightened them up by using eggbeaters and skim milk and they still turn out beautifully!  Thanks for posting.
169430,457979,2013-06-27,5,"OK, first, this makes one big cake! If your having a bunch over this make this. Everyone will love it (or should love it). It&#039;s not difficult to make and eveyones eyes will pop when you present it. The only tough thing about this is trying to find room in the fridge for it! It tastes wonderful and makes you look like a pro. Whats not to love?"
240552,208641,2008-03-05,5,"Amazing bread! I used quick oats as I didn't have rolled and it was fine.  My husband ate 4 pieces tonight with dinner.  Definitely worth the effort and great gift, too!  THanks, pattiday!  Made for Aus/NZ Recipe Swap #14"

2084888,140973,2011-11-27,0,"My first time making Monte Cristo Sandwiches.  Batter came out perfect, I put bowl in freezer with a couple of ice cubes while I prepped the rest of the ingredients. Be sure to remove ice cubes and stir with a wisk.  I also substituted the Swiss cheese for Smoked Gouda (yum), just make sure it's sliced thinly.  For the compote I did two, one using cranberry relish and one using boysenberry jam and aged balsamic vinegar (my preference).  I will use this recipe forever."
2330802,49737,2012-07-29,4,I followed the recipe to the t and it was way too salty for us.  I would recommend not adding any the additional salt since the bullion cubes already have plenty!  Other than that I really enjoyed the recipe thank you!
67728,169517,2012-07-29,5,"Different and tasty! I didn't have raisins in the house (I don't like them), so I subbed in Craisins instead, which were perfect in this. My persimmon wasn't quite as soft as I thought, so it mashed into a very chunky puree which left detectable bits of persimmon here and there (not a bad thing). I topped the bars with Kittencal's Recipe#90142 (with half vanilla and half coconut extract). They remind me a little bit of the Starbucks Cranberry Bliss bars, texture-wise. Oh, and I used chopped pecans for the nuts. Usually I pass over things with raisins and nuts in them, but I would definitely make these again. Thanks for posting! Made for The Honeys for ZWT8"

369047,137329,2008-09-01,5,"I can't believe I never wrote a review for this!  I've made this salad about 6 times since finding the recipe and my boyfriend & I love it!  We stick to the recipe minus the cumin seeds (we don't have them) and the mint, since we usually don't have it on hand.  This is a great, refreshing, summer salad to use up those tomatoes and cucumbers from the garden.  We've had it with Indian dishes, steaks, burgers, you name - it goes with them all! Thank you SO much for a great one!"
382203,54351,2011-02-06,3,"Sorry, these were just okay for us.  Thanks"
131021,59907,2009-01-17,4,"These were good, my oil was a little too hot at first, I used cheese raviloli. My kids and Dh ate them up. I would like to try them with beef raviloi next time."
174360,54879,2004-11-19,4,"I made this yesterday using the ""basic"" setting on my machine. My husband, a newly diagnosed diabetic, likes it very much!"
28533,30046,2003-05-19,5,"Wonderful recipe. Only change I made was add a red pepper, to which i had roasted, peeled & diced. Took it to a potluck at work and everyone loved it. I am going to make again for home and try to use less oil. Will advise how this turns out. "
345035,9060,2007-04-03,5,This was absolutely wonderful! Thanks so much!
53932,142464,2005-11-19,5,Tasty indeed!  I halved the brussels sprouts for double the flavor.  The lemon juice does add the finishing touch.  Thanks for sharing.
39394,16103,2005-07-31,2,VERY salty - taste doesn't make up for the huge amount of oil used. Can't recommend this one.
250440,29301,2007-03-07,5,"This was GREAT!  I was in the mood for Thai food and just really enjoyed this chicken.  As another suggested, I added the yogurt to the sauce after removing it from the heat.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I served this with Thai Coconut Rice Recipe #63446 and Asparagus With Lemon and Mint Recipe #126827.  It was such a wonderful meal.  Thanks so much, I'll be making this again!"
126440,446884,2012-09-22,5,Loved the ease of this.  Didn't know how to do it until I read this.  I used the seeds in a salad and it was great.
225997,39586,2007-05-10,4,"This was so easy and so good.  It took about 5 minutes to put together.  I used more mozzerella and less parmesan.  My husband, who normally complains about having ""weird"" vegetables also liked this dish.  It was delicious served over pasta with some fresh bread.  I will make it again."

323186,313867,2008-10-27,5,"Mmmm!   very good!  Made for lunch with friends, everyone loved it!
I underestimated the size of pan I would need, next time I will use a large loaf pan, and there will definitely be a next time.   I didn't have pumpkin seeds, so doubled up on the roasted sunflower seeds, and when I came to bake it, I sprinkled brown onion soup powder on top of the loaf, and then drizzled melted butter over that, mmmhmm!

I was quite surprised that even non-spinach lovers enjoyed this tasty loaf!

thanks, kitzy!"
448342,417238,2012-02-20,5,"Only 4 stars because I did not add salt and pepper (soy sauce was enough), or watercress (did not have).  I really like this as a side dish hot with pork chops and steamed broccoli and garlic bread.  Thanks for the recipe.<br/><br/>An update on this recipe:  We had it last night using rice noodles and with vegetables.  I'm sorry I only gave it 4 stars last time.  My star ratings have changed thanks to adivce from one of our members.  It's not fair to rate less if the person rating it does not go strictly by the recipe.  Anyway this time I hope I rated it correctly!  The seasonings used are excellent!!  Thanks breezermom for the recipe."
939875,149284,2009-11-08,5,"My mother always made this for holiday meals and I was searching the net trying to figure out where she might have gotten the recipe.  She never used pineapple in it at all, just the cabbage and carrots and believe it or not, it tastes great with a dollop of mayonnaise mixed in on your plate.  I wish I had some right now.  It's very refreshing with all of the heavy meats and starches served at holiday time."
2000332621,498090,2015-07-12,0,"I followed this recipe exactly, and this is the very best oatmeal raisin walnut cookie bar I have ever made! So moist and so yummy! So incredibly good and simple! BRAVO! I&#039;ve been baking for 40 years and never had my bars turn out this amazing! Thank you for this awesome recipe! Most Sincerely: DeRhonda Neff from Michigan"
877529,32204,2010-05-18,5,Super easy and super good!  Upped the oven temp. by 20 degrees due to altitude and ended up cooking 27 min.  Edges probably a bit overcooked but center nice and soft.  Added 1 cup Chin-chin.
1803327336,284015,2014-11-11,5,I have been making this for years but I use two cans of clams
62043,53214,2005-10-28,4,I made this for Rosh Hashanah. It was very tasty and extremely simple to make. I left out the raisins and cut the sugar in half and found it sweet enough.Thanks!
4470,149102,2009-10-19,5,A great flavor booster. I cut the recipe back to serve 2 and subbed  2 tbsp lite cream cheese for the cheddar.   Love the hot peppers in there - Served with a Mexican Pork steak recipe  Lovely dinner
173880,52035,2007-01-25,5,"Excellent, addicting and easy to make! Great to impress guests with presentation/decoration at parties! I used white and semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of bark, reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat oreos. No one will tell the difference!"
1638434,30385,2017-12-20,5,Love this recipe! I have made it several times and I always wonder why I donât make it more often. I make it as written and I am never disappointed. Great for leftovers also.
206616,68040,2006-07-30,2,"I made 1/4 of this recipe (one serving), using Penne pasta instead of elbow macaroni. Maybe it would have worked better with the smaller pasta, but I found that the cheesy sauce mostly stuck to the bottom of the pan rather coating the pasta. I guess it tasted O.K., because my boys ate it anyway. I just was disappointed that, despite adding the ingredients exactly as listed, this recipe did not turn out ""creamy."""
1094446,152713,2012-02-26,5,"I absolutely loved the flavour and texture of these burger patties! I followed the recipe pretty closely, using one can of kidney beans (which worked out to be a little less than 2 cups), one small carrot, plus I added 1/4 of a small onion, finely diced, as suggested by other reviewers. This gave me 4 good-sized patties.  I imagine that this is an extremely versatile recipe, but I liked it just with the chili powder and cumin.  My only little complaint is that they came out a tad dry after baking, but I wasn't too bothered by that.  A simple and delicious recipe!  Will definitely make again.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Made these again today, but using a mix of oatmeal and flour in place of breadcrumbs (didn't have any).  I also added a dash of garlic powder and some pepper to the mash, and instead of baking (no oven) I cooked the patties on a nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 3-4 minutes on the first side and then about 2 minutes after flipping.  They were even better than I'd remember them tasting!"
12129,47100,2003-04-02,4,"This was delicious!  My seven year practically made the entire dinner by herself.  We all loved it, and the fact that it's so simple is total bonus.  The onions on top really gave it that perfect finishing touch.  We had it with cranberry sauce and green beans!  It was just like Thanksgiving :)"
35635,38944,2002-09-03,0,Note: the temperature of you kitchen and the type of nut used (and how finely they are chopped) will influence how long and/or if you need to chill this before rolling into balls.
39636,27139,2002-06-08,5,"Just ""scrum-diddley-licious"" brownies. I love peanut butter. My daughter loves chocolate. This is the perfect recipe for us. It is easy to make. The recipe comes together quickly. The smell of the peanut butter and chocolate cooking nearly killed me!  We could not wait for the brownies to cool down. There we were munching into hot brownies. :-)  The brownies are not overly sweet.  The peanut butter and chocolate counter act each other. My daughter took some to work and my friends had the rest for afternoon tea.  Everyone that ate these brownies asked for the recipe. I am not going to tell you what these brownies look like. You are just going to have to cook these ""darlings"" for yourself to find out."

Now to worry, They were devoured in no time & apparently with great satisfaction! I'm not big on cooked spinach, that that doesn't stop me from making recipes like this that I know others will enjoy!

444434,22600,2007-02-04,5,"These impressed my Eastern European carnivore boyfriend.  He seldom eats anything that isn't loaded with salt and fat. He bought more bananas as soon as we ran out of the first batch of these!  I used spelt flour and almond milk and they were perfect!  I quadrupled the recipe both times I made them, or they would have been gone immediately."
88099,170754,2006-06-10,4,The flavor of this recipe is wonderful with a hint of brandy.  Love the small chuncks of apple and banana.  The only problem I had was that mine never set.  I even let it sit for 8 hours and it was still like soft homemade icecream.  The grandson loved it.  He thought he was eating ice cream.  Thanks
1591573,108854,2010-06-20,5,"Great!  Very reminicent of the traditional broccoli salad taste.  I halved the recipe since it was just for my family and reduced the mayo and sugar a bit to be a little more healthy and added chick peas for some protein.  YUMMO!  Thanks for posting. I do not like cauliflower usually, but this was sure tasty."
762139,103911,2008-02-12,3,"This was a very confusing recipe.  For example, step #2 says ""combine all ingredients except flour and water"" but it leaves out that you are also suppose to leave out the pineapple until step #5.  Also, in step #7 it was unclear which ""liquid"" to add the water to -- the pineapple liquid?  The liquid that was in the crock pot when you took out the roast in step #4?  I assumed it was the crock pot liquid since in step #9 it refers to ""hot liquid"" and I didn't know what other liquid would be hot.  Good, but steps need to be more clear."
2909502,361669,2013-07-20,5,Very good..I added a little soy sauce to the mix for some added flavor. Came moist and delicious. I will definitely make this dish again.
1174422,261173,2009-02-18,5,A great tasting easy recipe. It's essential to caramalise those onions though!
336058,91379,2007-06-16,5,"I didn't have a shallot, so will make again when I get them in my CSA box. Used a Vidalia onion (sauted in olive oil), dried thyme, tilapia, and tried the sherry. Not sure about the sherry flavor yet. Think I will try it without the sherry and see. I think it needed more onion, perhaps some garlic and more salt (for my pref.) I also like it thicker, so would try adding thickener. It made more than a saute pan could handle, so I transferred it to a soup pot. Will try again with those changes, but it was still tasty. UPDATE: I found out (I was at work when they ate) that everyone, including the kids, loved the soup, so it gets 5 stars! :)"
373495,19817,2008-11-27,5,"I'm not often so emphatic about the greatness of a beverage, but if I could give this more than 5 stars, I would!  Really delicious and refreshing.  I made the cinnamon syrup last Sunday for our Thanksgiving mid-morning snack.  I also used that Ocean Spray diet cranberry juice and diet 7 up - you can't taste the diety-ness of it, and I always like trimming calories when I can.  Thanks for posting-  I'm definitely making it again!!"

I really want to go back and eat more RIGHT NOW!"
588863,26111,2012-06-13,5,"Good and Easy!! I often use this with one can of pie filling--blackberry, cherry, peach, blueberry, etc. and don't need all the sugar. We eat it topped with ice cream or milk.  Thanks for posting.  I love quick recipes that are so tasty!"

215350,232298,2010-02-21,4,"This is great with the vodka (Or rum) in it, but by itself was a little sour/acidic. We used a ruby red grapefruit blend and 100% cranberry - next time I think I would use cranberry cocktail to give more sweetness. I made it without the alcohol and let people add their own, and I can give the leftovers to the kids. I made almost a punchbowl size and only a few cups were left, so it was popular!"
954555,370897,2009-05-12,5,"Greetings from Portugal, this is truely a marvlous receipe, I make it often.  My the kids just love it.  We usually don't use roast beef, instead we use a very thin steaks, and pepperonie sausage, the rest of the receipe is the same.  It is served  with french-fries surrounded all the way around the plate, its very good, but very bad for the waist-line !!
LOL LOL, but who cares!!!"
28649,106056,2004-12-15,5,This does work for a sore throat.  I read about this somewhere else and used it last week.  Sore throat dissappeared after 1 dose.  Not the greatest tasting stuff but very inexpensive and works great.

603831,76065,2007-12-31,3,"These were good, but I was a little disappointed.  It was runnier than other recipes I've tried.  I mixed it all together & had to refrigerate for over 24 hrs before I could work w/it.  Next time I'll probably add another cup or 2 of wafers.  Otherwise they were fine & everyone loved them."

92796,180155,2006-08-26,5,This zucchini hummus is AMAZING!!!  It is a little thin compared to regular garbanzo hummus.... I think if you shredded the zucchini  and then dehydrated for a while before putting in the food processor it would have a thicker consistancy!!! But the flavor is perfect!!!!
898927,112889,2008-07-22,0,"I just tried this recipe, and the shrimp came out perfectly cooked, just as you said.  The water wasn't boiling, but I stirred until two shrimp floated, and whalah!  Perfectly cooked 41-50 ct. shrimp!!  It was farm raised, and I can't wait to try it on some wild caught!
Thanks so much!!!  No more tough, overcooked shrimp."
761650,246785,2010-08-09,5,This is a great recipe for patty pan squash.  I used whole wheat bread that was a few days old.  The recipe made 4 medium size squash with enough filling to overfill.
498271,375050,2010-05-31,4,What a great refreshing drink!  Not too thick but very tasty.  I used vanilla ice cream this time but I'm looking forward to trying it with lemon or lime sherbet.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

55221,22111,2007-02-12,5,"This is THE Libby's pumpkin pie that my family enjoys every Thanksgiving! It's an outstanding recipe and simple enough even for beginner cooks. Hints: I halve the evaporated milk so as not to end up with more pie filling than my regular, not deep dish, pie pans can hold. And occasionally I substitute Splenda Brand Sweetener for half of the sugar, always with excellent results!"

140107,157456,2006-07-04,5,Comfort food at its best. Eggs benedict is good and avocado is great and puts this over the top of the hill of eggs benedict recipes. very good
15572,282502,2008-03-21,4,"I used pasilla chili powder.  This made a great dish coupled with some Morningstar Farms soy sausages.  Good, healthy breakfast."
199848,249902,2009-05-31,4,Very nice combination!  I only used 1 tbsp of the sesame oil and I'm glad I did because it was plenty and I thought it was a little too heavy of a flavor against the mango.  The fresh cilantro makes all the flavors really pop.  I only had white sesame seeds so I used them.  Thanx for an easy and unique salad.
381180,35867,2009-01-11,5,"YUM!!!  Increased the ingredients to make 1-1/2 recipe ~ used 1 extra large egg, and changed it up a bit!  Because I like dense chewy breads, I used half bread flour and half whole wheat flour; I added 1/4 cup peanut butter, 2 tablespoons vital wheat gluten, 1 teaspoon lemon juice and used 1-1/4 cups salted peanuts.  Used the dough cycle of the ABM; slashed two loaves and let rise for 45 minutes ~ baked in Pyrex at 350 degrees for 20 minutes."
65502,328242,2011-02-16,5,"We really really enjoyed this for dinner tonight! I thought that I had a can of tomatoes, but I must have used it! As a last minute resort, I cut up about a cup of grape tomatoes and added a cup of tomato sauce. It turned out great! Oh, I also only used 2 teaspoons of oil We enjoyed this with a salad and a bit of pasta. Made for the Best of 2010. Thanks Boomette! :)"
537617,133513,2008-05-10,5,"This is so easy and so tasty that it deserves 5 stars! I added Kimchi to mine and it was really good. I have been craving spicy food so I also topped it with Sriracha sauce. My husband kept eating my dinner and asked that I make it again on Saturday for lunch! I like that I can make one for each of my kids that is not so spicy but kick mine up a bit. Thanks for a fast yummy dinner! UPDATE:
It's Saturday and I made these for lunch.  This time I put Kimchi, green onion, bean sprouts and cilantro in it.  WOW!  It was so good!  I LOVE the addition of cilantro so I put some on top too. If you like it try it.  It was great!  Thanks again Potsie!"
67728,107708,2009-10-04,5,"This was kind of like fresher, more upscale ramen noodles, lol! It was super-simple to put together, and it tasted great! I was surprised to find that even with the full amount of the soy sauce mixture, this didn't taste overly salty. I marinated my beef slices overnight (not my intention, but I ran out of time to make this before work one day), which made them really flavorful. I sauteed my veggies for longer than a minute because DH wouldn't eat them if they were too close to being raw (that, and I like my onions more cooked). Not only is this tasty, it's visually appealing as well. Thanks for posting! Made for PAC Fall 09"
1259032,182494,2009-06-03,4,A big hit with both me and my other half...would never have thought about combining prawns and goats cheese!
2000505535,54257,2016-06-24,5,Delicious!!!! This was so moist &amp; tasted so good. I made it with 2 pounds of beef &amp; 2 slices of bread. The sauce I used 2 tbsp of brown sugar &amp; 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar because I did not have apple cider. This amount was sweet enough. We enjoyed this meatloaf. Will make again soon! Thank you for this recipe.
217796,189820,2009-01-16,0,I loved this! My DH thought it was too spicy so next time I will cut back on the red pepper. This recipe was super easy. I served it  with pasta salad and corn on the cob...delicious!
1056692,177369,2013-02-27,5,"I was feeling too lazy to make stew out of the chuck steak I had, and went searching.  Glad I decided on this recipe, as it's delicious.  I am not a huge fan of A-1, but it was great in this.  I did have to cut my steak up a bit for searing, since it was huge, but just poured the sauce over everything and turned it a bit more so it all cooked.  Let this simmer for almost 3 hours on low and it was so tender we almost needed a spoon to get the meat out of the pan.  Didn't have the sauce on anything but the meat, and it was good that way.  Not sure I'd like it on side dishes, but would prob be good with mushrooms.  Saving this one to make again.  Thanks for sharing!"
59144,137227,2005-11-02,5,Loved this recipe! Better than Chicken.
1228447,121498,2011-02-11,0,"This is my family's favorite red beans and rice recipe!  My boys hate pretty much everything, but are super happy when I make this.  To make this dish even easier, I throw all the ingredients in a slow cooker for the day.  The beans have been pre-soaked, and I use brown rice.  Thanks PanNan!"
222564,279165,2012-11-05,5,"Love these all natural truffles! Not sure whether sesame paste refers to tahini or halwa, I used halwa. Way to go, perfect!"
779699,382895,2009-11-16,5,These we sooooo good! We had them with some beef stew and the really made a great pair for that! I used the dough for regular french bread (about a 1 pound loaf cut in half) out of my ABM. I kept all the seasonings the same. I will make these again and again and again! Thanks for posting Diner!
226863,347708,2010-03-02,5,"I halved the number of steaks, but kept the sauce the same, because I just love mustard sauce....I also added more dijon.  My sauce was nice and thick, so maybe I didn't heat it enough to make it thin, but I just loved it!  Thanks so much for sharing."
620763,130569,2012-08-02,5,I used chicken tenders and they came out great! Breading is incredibly tasty. I used a little less garlic powder and cut seasoned salt down by half. My kids loved them.
229619,304705,2013-02-23,5,Yummy dish!  I added half a chopped purple onion and used chicken broth.  Served it as a side dish with seasoned chicken thighs and avocado slices.
290010,84101,2010-02-01,5,"Simply delicious!  I added 1 c. raisins.  I only used the dough setting on my bread machine.  Then, I  baked the bread for 35 min. at 375 deg.  It turned out great!"
234912,145847,2006-07-30,4,"Just tried this tonight and everyone loved it.  Next time I will try this as a stuffing for chicken breasts.  Very easy to make and flavorful.

783233,40729,2008-10-07,5,"This is delicious - cold and warm. I used the same amount of carrots as was written for the pumpkin (where is the recipe for Lennie's Carrot Mold?) and it was all done in the food processor. Even so, the taste was not overwhelmingly ""carrot."" The family thought it was pumpkin! It was also so easy!! Used eggbeaters instead of whole eggs, and cinnamon and ginger - two favorite spices. Thanks, Mirj."
44642,216223,2009-10-21,5,"Always made these for my children, and called them...egg in the nest and they loved them, I still do. Shadow I think all these young people should cook your recipes..than they would know, how good food should really taste. becauce you taste the food, not 20 other tastes.
Takes less time, cost less money.
and taste better. Sometimes what is old, is really  better.
Finding your page has made my day...Thanks, Shadows"
194993,150103,2006-01-08,4,"I liked it a lot, but my family was less enthusiastic. If I wre to make this again, I would cut up the chicken--it would be easier to eat and serve that way. I also used all ""Lite"" coconut milk. 
this dish definitely needs to be served over rice."
400175,18258,2008-07-02,5,"Perfect for a summer BBQ!  I always make my beans from dried, adding lots of onion and spice.  This probably added great flavor to an already good recipe!  Also, it's a trick for those who have time or on a budget (or both!).  I too used frozen mango, 3/4 of a 10oz. bag (I nibbled!) and it wasn't enough.  If you used frozen mango, use the whole bag, or even double it for extra yumminess!  The colors were so attractive (I did not puree, served it as a salad that some people did put on chips, but others ate as is).  Just a fresh, fresh dish!"
482376,427783,2010-06-18,5,"When pomegranate is in season (or when I can get the pomegranate seeds at Trader Joes!), I will make put this into the cooking rotation. I loved the combination of apricots and pomegranate! I also enjoyed the zing of spice that the harissa offered. ~Made for Zee Zesties on the ZWT6~"
692673,22782,2008-05-13,0,"Been making this type of sauce for many years, Sometime I add agrated carrot or one can of V8 juce,
or an 8 oz. of pizza sauce, the pizza sauce make it very red."
516926,196227,2009-04-17,5,I made these for a a Masters party and the guys were sopping up the sauce with crackers. Enough said! Thanks for a great recipe! (used Makers Mark). Made for PAC Spring '09
1048179,64112,2012-11-27,5,"This was a winner! We pureed all of the sauce because we like a smooth texture with our curries. The meatballs are so yummy! We ended up eating it with ground turkey instead of lamb because that is what we had, but I can only imagine it is even tastier with the lamb."
95743,62972,2008-01-15,5,"What a great dish especially for a harried night.  Delicious 27* recipe, KitchenManiac.  Wouldn't change a thing."
89134,90485,2007-04-12,5,"Delicious and easy!!  I used the large, Israeli toasted couscous and added a good bit of fresh parsley to it.  I also increased the amount of garlic drastically.  

I prefer a slightly thicker, but not stronger, glaze for the chicken so I added a touch of cornstarch to finish it.  Wonderful!"
1179225,142909,2011-12-09,5,This recipe is a killer find! Love it! These cookies are so festive and looked amazing in gift bags. The best part is that they taste delicious. Thanks so much for sharing such a great recipe. It will be a new holiday tradition.
80723,84556,2007-09-27,4,"Thanks Barb, this was just gorgeous and so easy to produce a fabulous meal.  My DH thought there was too much lemon juice, I disagree and since I cook it...............! It did not make enough sauce for me so I will have to tweak it a bit next time. I think I didn't add enough white wine.  I drank it instead."
452355,109427,2007-04-16,5,"My fiance and I made this last night and invited over two friends for dinner.  It turned out fantastic!  Everyone said they loved it.  It was very delicious and bursting with flavor.  I loved the sauce in particular!  The dish was not that difficult to prepare.  The only change I made was that I used cognac because I did not have brandy.  
I think the whole bottle of wine (versus the cup that other recipes call for) makes the dish and adds to the flavor.  Thank you for posting this.  I am filing this one away in my permanent recipe box!"
29782,153399,2008-05-27,5,"We really enjoyed this recipe! I changed the serving to 3 chicken rolls for this recipe. I  chopped and added some  sauted onions and celery to the stuffing along with 1 2/3 cup water that I added 3 chicken bouillon cubes to and I crushed a vegetable bouillon cube and mixed in with the stuffing.  I also made recipe#44746 in place for the store brand cream of mushroom soup and poured over the chicken rolls. I covered the dish with foil and baked for 30 minutes and uncover for another 30 minutes.  It was DELICIOUS and very tender and moist. I served this with Recipe#7904 , green beans and garlic bread.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!"
59969,7272,2003-02-02,5,"This is good stuff, even without the cheese."
209983,77800,2009-01-01,5,I made this last night for my New Years eve party.  We LOVED this!!! I put all the spices in a loose tea leaf holder and let it sit in my crock pot for about 6 hours.  House smelled AWESOME!!  Thanks so much for sharing such a great recipe!!!
382322,22179,2010-04-07,5,"I'm not sure if I should say THANK YOU or not. I made this for my kids (4,3 and 1) and ever since then I hear ""swirly toast"" every time I ask them what they want for breakfast. 

Great recipe!"
1063698,175920,2009-10-24,5,My daughter had a craving for Chicken Pad Thai the other night. I have never cooked Thai before so didn't have a clue what to do. I tried this recipe and we were all delighted. So simple yet so delicious. A definite keeper.
387646,49172,2008-09-23,4,"I made these for my host family in Japan and they loved the puff so much they said, ""you can sell this!"""
204024,373764,2009-07-28,5,This is very fresh and sweet tasting.  I looked at all the stores in my area.  No one had lemon sherbert so I had to use orange sherbert.  It was very good but I know the lemon would have been even better.  Made for Summer Comfort cafe.
607393,143517,2008-01-29,4,"We served this when family was visiting and, overall, it was a success. We used cubed chicken breasts instead of thighs. It definately was a differnt twist on chili, which is appreciated.

We did a 'dump and let cook for four hours' run and it still turned out well."
140132,97340,2009-09-24,5,"We absolutely loved this chicken.  I used drumsticks and let it marinate for 3 hours.  It didn't take as long for the chicken to cook.  We will make these  many times, as it is a recipe that doesn't require many ingredients.  Thank you so much for sharing this yummy chicken recipe with us, we will be making again."
620081,234336,2007-12-12,5,I was amazed at how simple and delicious this turned out! I omitted the capers (not a family favorite). I will definitely make this again. Thanks for such a great recipe!
190677,131961,2007-09-07,5,"Love it! I've made this twice; once as written, which was great, and once with some replacements: lemon juice instead of red wine vinegar, cilantro for mint, red bell peppers instead of green, and cucumbers instead of scallions. Equally great!"
171328,134507,2008-08-12,5,"This is a keeper!  Salty, savory, sweet and with a crunch from the walnuts.  I used orange flavored craisins.  It was very popular at a potluck - someone even asked ""who brought the gourmet couscous dish?""  It's perfect for a picnic as there's no dairy or mayo.  It's good warm, room temperature, and cold."
104295,782,2005-06-03,5,"Very nice potatoes!  I used fat free yogurt, a tiny bit of spray butter, and fat free cheese.  Dh thought it needed some garlic powder but I really loved it.  I actually thought it was better lukewarm then hot."
1314403,373812,2009-07-17,5,This is a great trick!  I am now able to cook up a large batch of sausage at the beginning of the week and have it quick and easy in the morning for breakfast.
30161,21037,2002-10-18,5,"Thank Aunt Debbie for us!

"
96177,331562,2008-12-01,5,"Fantastic flavor. I used the frozen butter beans from last summer's garden! Only pureed about 1 cup, so the soup is more liquid, but we like it that way. Made for everyday's a holiday tag. Thanks Mandy."
137428,76304,2010-01-01,0,Our eggnog was so strongly flavored we couldn't taste the chocolate at all. When we added much more chocolate syrup the whole concoction became oddly bitter. We will have to try again with another brand of nog. Sorry I couldn't give a better report.
56181,47014,2004-03-16,4,"This was very easy to throw together and produced a tasty bread!  I agree with the reviewer that said it wasn't real sweet and to let it cool for about 20 minutes before cutting.  To sweeten mine, I whirled some cream cheese and homemade strawberry jam in my food processor until mixed and creamy to use as a spread.  I loved it with that on top!  I will definitely be making this one again.  Thanks, Recipe Fairy!(="
1116792,281162,2010-12-31,5,"So, I didn't have any of the potato chips so I subbed panko--liked the combo of the spices with it and cooking time/temp was perfect. yum!"
477972,89204,2008-08-06,4,"Nice, simple recipe. I've made something like it before but it didn't have cream cheese. My family enjoyed it."
183253,200296,2007-09-16,5,Another great recipe from Kittencal.  It was so good and easy to make.  My whole family loved the chicken even the picky eaters.  Thank you so much for taking the time to post your recipes.  I wish I grew up in your house.
1022987,439185,2012-07-30,5,"These were fantastic!  They were incredibly easy to make, I can't believe I spent so much time buying them before. I've made them 3 times in the past week already - the kids will actually willingly eat spinach if it's like this.  I couldn't find fenugreek though..... I'll have to look the next time I'm in the city. Still great, and I'll be making these a lot! Thank you so much for posting!"
223169,76683,2006-05-22,5,"WOW, this is in the baking dish in seconds and the outcome is awesome, full of flavours. If you can make it with fully ripe tomatoes it is one of the most easiest to make and yet so delicious fish recipes. Great on a summer evening with a glas of a not-too-cold white wine and some crusty bread. Add some olives and cheese and this will turn out to be heaven. Thanks evelyn for a wonderful recipe."
132010,84180,2007-01-04,5,I tried it and this is a fabulous cake!  I loved how easy it was to make and how wonderful it made the house smell. My cake actually only needed 45 mins. to bake.  Any longer and it would have dried out.  I will be making this again. Thanks for posting!
1545344,73166,2010-02-07,5,"OMG! This is, by far, THE BEST chili you will ever taste!  The beer, coffee, and cocoa really make the flavors pop!  Soooo good!"
343876,33864,2010-11-02,5,"Yum!! I couldnt find the Lipton Savory Herb and Garlic Soup mix, so I used a Garlic and Herb mix from Knorr instead. The marinade keeps the chicken tender and juicy, and with delicious flavor! I used this chicken to top off a greek salad and it was all around fabulous!"
62043,27943,2003-07-07,5,This was really delicious Sharon. I made it for my DH and his buddy as a reward for finishing a project. They loved it! I made it exactly as written except I used 2% milk and left off the strawberries (garnished with banana slices instead). Thanks for a wonderful breakfast/ brunch item!
973186,32607,2011-05-30,5,Loved it.  Halved the recipe and also subbed the brown sugar for the molasses.
1675332,359280,2013-07-31,0,Great marinade! The only thing I changed was to move Step 1 to Step 3 and moved Steps 2 &amp; 3 up one. Two to three hours to overnight seemed a long time to preheat the grill! :)
302744,225566,2008-02-08,5,"Can we say, ""Heaven in a spoonful?""  Yum.  I was unable to let this chill an hour before consuming a big portion of it.  :)  I had had a mango curry chicken salad from the Whole Foods deli.  It was outrageously good.  Next time I went to Whole Foods, of course, it was not to be seen.  So I looked up a recipe.  This sounded pretty close.  And it is.  Yay!  (Much more cost effective to make my own, especially at the rate I eat it up!)  The only changes I made were to up the curry, use fully fatted mayo and sour cream and add dried cranberries.  (I didn't measure how much chicken I used, so upping the curry may have been necessary only because of the amount of chicken I used.  I'm not sure.)  I'll definitely be enjoying this regularly.  Thanks so much for posting it."
530501,30951,2009-02-12,5,Great recipe. I used olive oil instead of butter and frozen green beans instead of fresh. I didn't have any fresh. The whole family enjoyed the beans. Will try fresh basil from my garden this summer.
179133,203486,2007-09-04,5,"This was wonderful! I made a couple minor changes: green onion instead of regular (had them to use), red pepper instead of green (same reason) and no celery (don't like it!) I used home grown veggies which just made it that much better I'm sure. Thanks for posting this recipe blgpts - I will be saving it for future summers!"
498478,23765,2008-09-21,5,I love the old fashion recipes. This recipe is like the one my mom use to make. It is great
323186,312598,2009-05-08,5,"Simple to make, we enjoyed this very much. I did find my peas took more like 45 minutes to cook, but I had allowed for that. A thick delicious soup with lots of flavour, I was generous with the bacon, forgot the paprika, and sliced some spring onions on top as well, we enjoyed the sharp onion with the soup!     I made some garlic bread to go with this and we had ourselves a feast!
Thanks for a simple and totally delicious supper, Pat!"
352271,227572,2007-11-24,5,"Excellent! I made this stuffing using a 5 lb. chicken. I halved the recipe and had some left over to cook in aluminum foil alongside the stuffed chicken. I did as you said about not packing the stuffing too tight, as it really is important when cooking chicken or turkey not to overstuff your bird. This stuffing is moist, tasty and just plain delicious. I love the addition of the sausage, and the spices were just right. Thank you Linda's BK for this delicious recipe. I will be making my turkey using this stuffing for sure! Ann

Update:  I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving, and stuffed my turkey.  The juices from the turkey made the stuffing even more delicious than in the chicken!  You have a winner here Linda.  Thank you Shirley!"
115758,219760,2007-09-01,4,"A simple quick n easy vege curry. I used a stock standard Keens curry powder, a 400g tin of organic chick peas and threw in some chopped green beans for extra colour. You could clean out your vege drawer with this one...adding anything you had on hand.
Thanks Chrissyo!"
1166426,248858,2009-02-16,5,"This is one of the best recipes I've tried in a long time.  It is fresh and light, but also filling and comforting - didn't even know that was possible.  I substituted vegetable broth for the olive oil to cut out the fat.  I had to add some extra broth after putting the eggplant in to keep it from sticking.  It turned out really great.  Thanks so much for sharing this one."
496594,301704,2009-08-14,5,"This made a very tasty loaf of bread with a great texture. I made the recipe as written, but had to add another 3 tablespoons of water as I thought the dough was a bit dry after the initial kneading. Made the dough in the bread machine and then baked it in the oven.
Thanks for sharing a great recipe!"
246844,99939,2007-05-29,5,"Wow.  These were fabulous!  A combination of flavors I never could have imagined.  Thank good for the Zarr World Tour, or I might never have found this! Made just as written.  I had some trouble getting the patties to stay together.  We didn't mind, they tasted amazing.  Thanks for sharing!"
601528,59363,2010-01-01,4,Very good and very easy.  1/4 the recipe and used it as needed on a few slices of bread for our Bowl Game appetizers today.  I'll keep the rest in the fridge for future use.
1084285,225347,2010-10-13,5,"OK I have to admit that this is the best Margarita recipe I have found.  These will sneak up and get you if your not careful.  It was a little sweet for some of my friends so I added another beer (Corona) and 1/2 of the lime-aid on the second pitcher.  I used Fresca because it was what I had.  This one is a keeper and a HUGE ""Thank-You"" to Kittencal for another great recipe."
67835,24011,2004-03-05,5,"Hi, Tish!  Your recipe is simmering on the stove as I type.  It is DELICIOUS!  I used Cream Sherry because I had on hand and goofed when I added all 6 tablespoons to the pan.  I ended up still using 3 more tablespoons with the cornstarch.  Sure didn't hurt the taste a bit.  This is our first use of ""Brie"" and it won't be the last.  Love cheese, but just haven't tried Brie before.  Thanx for a great recipe!  "
206722,135233,2005-10-14,4,I agree with Beck D that this could use a little more kick; otherwise a nice salad
318139,121256,2006-11-23,5,"Those were great !
i used whole wheat "" petits beurres"" and i added some peanuts, very good ! i will make this again and take a picture."
363317,179233,2006-11-05,5,"This recipe was great.  I have made it twice, and it turned out terrific each time.  I followed the directions exactly, with the exception that I added fresh basil to the sauce."
130819,101410,2005-10-21,5,"We love sausages but they are reserved for those 'treat meal days'... and this is definitely a treat. Made this several times using sweet Italian sausages. What a wonderful combination, the onions, peppers and tomatoes so compliment the sausage. Having an abundance of home grown tomatoes I did toss in a couple extra tomatoes, other then that I followed the recipe ... wouldn't change a thing. This ones another keeper!"
29794,56103,2005-01-26,5,"I absolutely love these. I am a huge fan of veggies and really, there isn't a better way to cook these little guys. Easy prep, cooks in no time. Excellent."
482933,281762,2008-09-12,5,"Perfectly delicious!  You can't go wrong with this side dish. Juicy, tasty, healthy, and super easy.  I made as posted except I used light mayonnaise.  This would be good with any cheese.   I did have mine under my broiler a bit too long-it was a bit less than 2 minutes.  Thanks bmcnichol for posting a keeper. Made for PRMR tag."
65056,13285,2003-09-10,5,"Mmmm! We made these last night and they were great! Instead of onion powder we used finely chopped onion which added a bit of fresh flavor along with the fresh parsley we used instead of parsley flakes. Also, since it was rainy, we pan-fried rather than grilled. They were wonderful! I would have maybe added even a bit more feta if I had more, but then again I'm a real cheese fan. We ate them on whole-wheat buns brushed with olive oil and toasted in the oven. They go very well with dijon mustard I found and are quite easy. mmmm...."
53959,60142,2006-09-16,5,"Absolutly delicious. I made it before dinner since it is so hot here I figured I could cool down with it. As soon as my daughters saw it, they all had to have large glassfuls and by the end of dinner it was all gone. "
274913,61514,2012-09-12,5,"i just tasted the best grape jelly of my life thanks to this recipe! i never gave the stuff much thought, but i found one market stall bursting with concord grapes last week & thought i'd try doing something with them. SO glad i did!! i had no idea the stuff could taste so fruity and rich. just lovely. set just thick enough without turning to gel. really a wonderful discovery. thanks so much for sharing!"
129357,37336,2004-07-15,4,"So easy to make. I served with vegatables and mashed potatos. Very tasy and very filling. I think I would drop the cooking time by 5-7 mins next time, but still a very tasty easy dish. This is the second time I have made this and will do so again."
408454,274625,2008-10-18,4,"Nice recipe!
Next time I will use homemade broth ( less salt ).
I will also add more garlic and some crushed red pepper.

Nice recipe we all liked and easy to make."
8377,299296,2010-06-06,5,"Absolutely delicious and so easy to make. I made it as posted just added a little extra cheese. I cut the asparagus first, quickly blanched, then iced them. They were the perfect crispness when the dish was baked. Great recipe!"
29782,102338,2005-04-20,5,"I enjoyed this casserole. I have had one similar to this but I hadn't ever used egg so I thought I would give this a try and it turned out great.I did only use one egg cause I wasn't sure how it would  do. It held the casserole together. 
Thanks for sharing your recipe"
306797,55968,2007-12-10,5,"This was a great curry.  I've made red chicken curry before, but the eggplant was a great addition.  I used chicken breast & regular eggplant, also added red pepper & bamboo shoots.  Made for Aus/NZ Recipe Swap December 2007.  Thanks Elmotoo for sharing this keeper."
1378713,395577,2009-10-20,5,This is a wonderful recipe for canning tomato's. I haven't tried it yet but I will soon and it sounds delicious.

1161442,218232,2009-07-05,5,"Very easy to make and was a huge hit at our summer party. People kept taking one shrimp from a skewer, (I'm not sure if that was to be polite or to make sure they would like the flavor first.) but as soon as they would eat the one piece they'd go back and grab the entire skewer for themselves. We will be making this one again!"
559159,147033,2009-04-08,1,"If you like the taste of popcorn with a taste of chocolate chips, then this the recipe for you. The cookies did burn, but I put in a second batch and they still tasted like popcorn... and I don't like popcorn at all. This is NOT the recipe for me or my family. I've definitely tasted better vegan cookies."
38418,95988,2006-06-14,5,"Loved it!  I did make some changes.  I forgot the red peppers when I went shopping so I had to omit those.  I used marinated atrichoke hearts instead of the plain ones and I left out the salami because I don't like it.  I will definitely make these again.  They would be great for appitizers, too. Thanks for sharing. :o)"
335571,402526,2010-09-09,5,"I love this stew! Make this stew, it is everything stew should be, meaty, rich, hearty... except without babysitting it on the stove. You just slice the stuff up, mix it up, stick it in the oven and then at supper time, tada- it's ready!"
280271,505956,2014-03-04,5,I&#039;m giving this 5 stars for the spicy tart flavor...not for presentation...I would have liked to see the chicken brown lots more...with that said both hubby and I enjoyed the heat and the tartness this dish gave us...it was something unusual and greatly appreciated...thanks for posting the recipe...=)
1762460,50737,2011-07-04,5,"I was very pleased with this recipe, normally i don't care for home made biscuits people make because of the baking powder, or soda taste. This was a perfect recipe for me for taste, and it was very simple, thanks for sharing."
157425,206892,2007-01-30,5,"Wow, this is so very good! Engrossed thank you for posting this recipe, it will definitely be made often! I was worried that the peppermint would be to overwhelming but everything blends so well together. The mild peppermint and chocolate flavor is very good and the creamer gives this a nice creamy, rich flavor. I did top with the whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate for a very delicious treat this afternoon. If I had not made it I would have thought it came from a specialty coffee shop. A must make recipe!"

1462970,335597,2018-02-11,5,"Wow! This was SO good. I really appreciate the fresh, natural (no can approach). Definitely going in my recipe box for future use. Thanks!"
235493,39444,2007-01-01,5,These were a big hit at Christmas this year!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Made 2 batches and they disappeared very quickly.  Made them with Heath chocolate & toffee pieces and they turned out great.  Thanks!
58104,52436,2003-02-19,5,This was good I did use sweet potato just couldn`t get fresh pumpkin. And I kicked it up a little with some pepper sauce.
41218,100039,2005-09-01,5,"WONDERFUL combination of flavors.  My H,a basic meat and potato man, used the words ""nice flavor""! In a hurry, I forgot to make the gravy and the dish didn't skip a beat.  Can only imagine how it will taste next time with gravy! HATS OFF to you, PIANOLADY!"
804478,146563,2009-05-08,5,"Excellent! I made this today and instead used 1 part coffee mix to 2 parts ice. I like a creamier, iced coffee. It was delicious. Next time I make it though, I will replace the 3/4 cup sugar with 3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk, because I think the syrupier it is, the better the ice will blend with the mix. Since I used double the ice, it did tend to seperate slightly as the coffee mixture is pretty liquidy."
176615,121200,2005-05-10,5,"Awesome! I used to buy this from a little frufru shop till I started making it myself. I like the candy well-crushed but not pulverized. Orange hard candy and lime hard candy are delicious as well and an assortment of the three is quite attractive in any gift basket. Thanks, RiffRaff, for posting!"
162826,31626,2005-09-30,5,"Bergy, excellent recipe for ribs!!! The sauce is to die for.Thanks for posting."
22394,8554,2001-10-29,5,Thanks for this recipe.  It has become a big favorite with my family.
191050,26257,2009-03-08,4,"I followed this recipe to the letter and used the exact ingredients recommended and the pork came out so juicy and tender! Loved the cooking method for this pork!  I wasn't a huge fan of the Molasses BBQ Sauce and neither was my DH, but I suppose we're just used to a thicker, sweeter sauce.  Will use the pork rub and cooking method again!  Thanks for sharing!"
945199,226851,2009-08-20,5,One of the best pizzas is right here!
178117,184031,2006-09-02,5,"Wow!Wow!This is the best idea since sliced bread!It gets so hot here in az.,and I hate turning the oven on in the summer.I saw this and had to try it.Thank you!Thank you!Thank you!Now ,i dont have to go without my lasagna anymore,only thing,i did different was I just used regular lasagna noodles ,broke them up a little but my dish tasted just like oven lasagna.Thank you for sharing!"
148715,118826,2010-01-08,5,This was amazing.  Served this over brown rice.
478599,231511,2007-08-15,4,"A very nice and easy recipe.  I used the seasonings as listed, I happened to have some fresh basil and I also added a little fresh oregano.  The chicken was tender and done in a jiffy on the grill.  I served this with parsley potatoes that I grilled in their own foil pouches.  I am planning on using this method again for more grilling adventures."
664841,77023,2008-07-16,0,My Kids really liked this one.  Thay asked me to make it again after the first bite.  Thanks for a great easy dinner recipe.
886636,91120,2008-07-09,0,Perfectly delicious!
149363,121461,2006-06-16,5,I have also made this for the ZWT II and will be back with the results in a couple fo weeks!
37449,77002,2004-01-03,5,"I really like the stuffing for these chiles. I used frozen corn that I broiled. Sometimes poblano peppers are real hot and sometimes they're not. Well, these were real hot, too hot, but I did like the stuffing! Thanks Heather!"
88099,99957,2004-10-27,4,"I made these for my zaar dinner tonight.  These were very good, DH really liked them, but I think I will try some added onion as suggested by OhMyStars.  I liked the chives in this recipe"
318262,470175,2013-07-18,4,"This was a delicious and intensitly flavored corn! For ease, I just mixed the butter and spices together and slathered it on!"
562874,108775,2013-01-06,4,"We left the scales on the bottom of the salmon which helped keep the flavor in. We also used aluminum foil brushed with a little olive oil to prevent sticking. We chose a sweet/spicy mustard that turned out great. I'm not a seafood eater AT ALL, and bought the salmon for my DH and I was brave enough to taste it, and it was not bad at all! It didn't have a fishy taste, but you could really taste the flavor of the spicy mustard. We'd definitely make this again. Thanks!"
4470,39364,2002-09-16,5,The garden is groaning for me to pluck & pick and enjoy it's bounties ant that I did with this heavenly dressing.  Had this salad for lunch with cold sliced chicken breast - very very good - This dressing will be a regular  Thanks Dorothy
68526,343934,2009-02-15,5,"These went great with my Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Recipe #236271 for my DS's and my Valentine's dinner.  He LOVED these and asked me for the recipe so he can make them himself.  I used a shake or two of red pepper flakes in place of the chili pepper, as that's what I had on hand and I did cut back on the ginger too.  These were the perfect side with the tuna!  Thank you for sharing your recipe with us Noo!  Made for 123 Hit Wonders 2/09  Linda"
3855,21726,2002-09-09,4,"My boyfriend was in Australia about a year ago and fell in love with meat pie.

So I made this for him and he loved it!
So did I!"
6651,321948,2009-08-16,5,"I'm a fan!!!  My family loves eye roasts because they are so lean, and our roast was cooked perfectly (and also very juicy).  I bought a  2-pound roast because I wasn't sure how it would turn out.  My oven has a fan that kicks in when the oven is turned off, and I wasn't sure if the oven would cool off too quickly and cause the roast to be uncooked -- but that was not an issue at all.  Next time, I'll make a bigger roast so we have more leftovers for sandwiches.  Thanks so much!"
80353,154024,2006-06-08,5,"Absolutely terrific.  I made it up in no time and we're all presently snacking on flat bread and Thorsten's Domatosalata recipe.  Fresh oregano, basil, rosemary and marjoram were my herbs of choice.  Excellent recipe."
37779,72620,2005-03-15,4,This was very easy to make and so nice to come home to. I agree with moxie about the green peppers. I wonder if adding them in about half-way into the cooking time would make a difference?? I think I will try that next time. The sauce had a very delicious flavor and the kids and husband liked it. Thanks Miraklegirl for sharing this recipe. 
345569,106027,2009-01-28,4,"This was my first time using TVP, and I think it worked out pretty well!  For some reason I didn't realize it said to use three packets of Splenda -- I only used one, and I can agree that it needed some more sweetness!  I skipped the butter and cream, and I used a bit less than a cup of water instead of milk.  I added cinnamon and some banana slices.  It was an interesting change from oatmeal, but 1/2 cup makes a LOT -- half that amount would have been plenty for one person!  Thanks for posting."
586469,359833,2009-04-08,4,"I made the tzatziki cucumber sauce, which was a lot of work even for a small amount.  This recipe is also a lot of work for one serving. Having never made the cucumber sauce and also never tasted hearts of palm, I was a little nervous about how this would turn out or taste. I did like the taste, but the red cabbage color leached out into the egg and shrimp and didn't look very appealing, so my picture would not do justice to this recipe. I would make this again as it is a nice healthy salad and good flavor."
353131,224591,2009-03-09,4,Made these to go with your roast recipe. DH and I thought these were great. Simple to make and had a terrific taste. The kids didn't like them. I guess maybe it is more of a grown up thing. Thanks for the recipe!!
817635,78814,2008-12-26,4,"Yummy! I cooked them without the sauce, and they turned out great! Next time, I'll take out a little of the garlic powder and add more cream cheese--but these are definitely a repeat! Thanks! :)"
1380266,389620,2014-05-09,4,"Great recipe, my family really enjoyed it.  It&#039;s so delicious, easy and quick to make.  Served it over brown rice.  Next time, I probably will use jasmine rice.   :-)"
1753736,374711,2010-12-07,5,"My mom and I have made these every year since I was a little girl. The picture in the Pillsbury cookbook shows fluffy white meringues with pink showing through the cracks, but we've never been able to achieve that, they're always just plain pink! My guess is that breaking the candy into larger chunks, so there isn't as much pink candy dust to color the meringue, would help. We also used to use the jumbo candy canes, that were straight and about 1"" across and 12"" long - less red dye used than in the regular sized canes. Regular peppermint candies work too, but unwrapping each little candy is labor-intensive."
115525,5170,2007-07-04,4,"The batter was a little thin - next time I'll add a bit more flour.  I halved the recipe, and did not make 9"" pancakes, but 4"", and still got 18 pancakes for the two of us!"
82367,59122,2004-08-17,5,"These were great Pamela!Wanted something different to BBQ and these fit the bill, my first time making shish kebobs on the grill,if you can believe that! And with this recipe it certainly won't be the last! The only other time I can remember us having them we picked up pre-made ones from the meat section at the grocery store. Won't be doing that again now! I didn't plan far enough ahead so these only marinated for the afternoon, and they were still delicious and flavourful, I can't imagine that they could be much better with the overnight marination but they probably are! We only used beef this time,and for veggies we used cherry tomato, onion, red, green & orange peppers, & mushrooms. I look forward to trying with the chicken and pork as well, and I think I will add zucchini next time too,(asked hubbby to get some but he forgot at the store!!) I actually thought these were kind of fun to make and with the prep work done the night before,(which I will do next time!) the next day will be a breeze just having to prepare the skewers and your sides! Thanks Pamela, hubby and I really enjoyed these!"
470351,131909,2008-10-27,5,I can't believe I'm the first person to review this one more than 3 years after it was posted but it's fabulous!   If you like the ingredients listed in this recipe you will LOVE this dish!  I used more crushed red peppers and more garlic than stated.  I used 6 small tomatoes (that I did not de-seed) and followed the rest of the recipe as stated.  We LOVED it!  My 2 year old was digging the chickpeas out to eat by the handful.  Will definitely make this one again and again!  Thank you for posting!
2000804136,461351,2016-01-06,1,"So, I wanted to surprise my mom and have dinner made for her when she arrived home from work. I&#039;ve made stuffed meatballs before, but I wanted to try this recipe because I believed it would give my meatballs a &quot;better/softer&quot; texture. Now, my ruined dinner possibly could be my fault. Maybe I didn&#039;t brown the meatballs enough, but when I checked on my food about 4 hours later all of the cheese had oozed out and the inside of the meatball was still undercooked. The moral of the story is, if you decide to use this recipe I highly suggest you bake it because the slow cooker will leave you disappointed."
463202,221018,2008-03-26,5,"As with some other traditional foods I had never tasted before, I knew if I tried FT's version, I couldn't go wrong. :)  I wasn't disappointed with this recipe either.  Easy to throw in the breadmachine, easy to make, and absolutely delicious fresh from the oven.  I'm not sure how they tasted the next day, because the entire batch disappeared.  I didn't know what ""mixed spice"" was, so I used pumpkin pie spice, because I had it and I knew it would taste good with more cinnamon, raisins and cranberries.  I also do not have a breadmachine with a raisin tray, so I just kneaded them in before I cut the dough into 12 pieces.  Thank you for posting, FT! :)  I will DEFINITELY be making these again."

593927,492531,2013-01-03,5,"Tasty and light at least how I had to change it to suit my diet. There is a similar tea which in Arabic they call, chai haleeb meaning milk tea made in Kuwait and I think Saudi Arabia as well so this is probably a regional recipe enjoyed with breakfast and also the last small meal of the day during the evening, lunch being the main meal of the day. I made this with homemade almond milk of which I had removed their skins, I know. My husbands family (Kuwaiti background) uses Carnation evaporated milk in this type of tea, to be healthier I used my usual since being pregnant, Traditional Medicinals Prganic Red Rasberry leaf tea bags which I simmered in a little water with organic sugar (no headache), and cardamom pods. I added it to the almond milk without simmering because I know it separates. I tried some that way as well as some with a little powdered ginger. DD, 5 years old and I liked the tea with the addition of ginger most. I may male this again with a different dairy free milk. Made for January 2013 ~ NA/ME explores OMAN!"
1803251632,196850,2017-01-16,0,Could this be a make ahead dipping oil!? Would it need to be refrigerated? What is the storage time?
402559,140171,2007-02-22,4,Pretty good. I personally prefer this without the salsa but I would make it this way again. Thanks!
148221,120753,2013-07-24,4,"I made the pumpkin version and it turned out pretty well, considering there is no oil or white sugar added.  I made it in a 9&quot; x 9&quot; pan, and they turned out very moist with a nice, chewy texture.  My only critique is that I felt the bars could use a little more flavor, like a kick of something - more spices perhaps. Other than that, pretty good for such a healthy recipe."
495666,39446,2007-06-27,5,I loved this dish.  The only thing I did differently (at the advice of other reviewers) is add an 8 oz can of tomato sauce to the tomato mixture.  Next time I think I would prefer to use 1/2 cup rice and 1/2 cup of lentils in place of the cup of pasta.  I will be making this on a regular basis!
254614,188549,2006-10-27,3,"I used a light setting on the 
toaster, then brushed melted garlic
butter, put basil,italian seasoning
in the cheeses,broiled until melted.This cuts the prep time.Made
one with tomato puree,one without it.The rating is for the one without the puree.Everyone liked it. Thank you."
58104,154344,2006-09-26,5,Excellent! I made this marinade and glaze with a 1/2 of a butterflied leg of lamb. So good a must try! Grill it used the zest of the lemon. Thanks! 
1159075,210757,2010-03-05,5,this was really really good. I wished I had doubled the batch so I could get it for the next week. Thank you so much for posting this.
156653,71739,2005-04-12,5,OMG!!!!! This rice is the BEST I have ever made from scratch. I am putting this one in the permanent recipe book. Thank you Thank you Thank you Bergy!
560491,435005,2011-02-03,5,"These were really good in the oven, I bet will be ten times better this summer on the grill!!  Made in a foil pan for easy clean up.  Added a little dried parsley on top for garnish.  I needed these to cook faster to be done the same time as the rest of my meal (poor planning) so cook for 35 minutes on 400 degrees F.  Made for Photo Tag."
354540,309606,2009-06-12,5,"If the kids could give this more than 5 stars they would...and that says alot!  I had leftover fresh veggies from DD grad party...so it was broccoli, snap peas, carrots, cauliflower, I used grape tomatoes cut in half, 1 tsp garlic, 1/4 diced red onion, 1 cup shredded colby-jack cheese and 1/3 cup parmesan cheese grated.  For the sauce I cheated and used about 1/3 cup or so of Italian dressing (paul newman's family recipe) and 1/2 cup or so of Ranch...I used the juice of 1/2 lemon.  For pasta I chose rotini as I think it holds the sauce well...Thanks so much for posting this delish recipe...I'm sure to make this alot this summer when the garden is bountiful...very flavorful and healthy...and the best part is the kids LOVED it!!!"
252928,31135,2005-10-17,5,so tasty!!
157306,97315,2004-09-23,0,"This is a great little recipe.  The only problem I had was that I discovered that I do not like the flavor or texture of oranges in muffins!  Oops.  I think I will try again with apples and cinnamon instead because the muffin itself is incredible, moist and tasty with lots of healthy stuff inside.  The only change I did make was to use natural applesauce instead of oil and the taste and texture was still wonderful."
133174,96884,2006-06-28,5,"I have had this recipe marked since March 28, 2006.  Peaches have finally come into season and I got to make this wonderful recipe.  I did increase the amount of peaches and used a little less milk than called for.  This was served warm and topped with low-fat vanilla yogurt.  "
185285,77869,2005-05-14,5,"Yummm - I had leftover pecans I needed to use up, and this sounded great!  I did run out of butter, so I subbed with 1/2 shortening (MEAN would have been disheartened) - but they turned out great!"
46902,21171,2016-08-26,5,I lost my recipe several years ago and this year tried to find just the right one. We tried 3 different recipes before I found this! This is the one!! It was wonderful and so moist. Thanks for the recipe.
294145,86341,2006-02-21,5,"I mad this meal for my wife on Valentines day, because Chicken picata is what we had at our wedding reception 5 years ago. We both thought it was one of the best chicken dinners that we have ever had. It was so easy to make, I didn't expect it to taste as good as it did. A MUST MAKE for anyone who likes chicken picata. Thabk you for the recipe."
195589,8595,2009-07-05,5,"These were SO good! Used the steak, but we didn't have time to grill, so sauteed all on the stove top. Can't wait to try them on the grill. I marinated the meat for about 5 hours. Also, used only the red and yellow peppers. Next time I will add some shrooms to the mix. Served with shredded sharp cheddar cheese, sliced black olives, sour cream, chopped tomatoes, salsa and diced avocados. I put my tortillas in a glass dish, cover with a damp dish towel and microwave them for a minute or so. Then let everyone add their own toppings and enjoy! Delicious! Thanks for posting Robbie Rice."
844444,48760,2009-06-23,5,This was great! I used leftover grilled steak diced up and threw in some raw broccoli..it was delish! Thanks!
2000760031,38067,2015-12-31,5,"Great recipe. Simple to make, has a nice flavor and budget-friendly!"
2465500,45070,2012-12-30,5,Thanks for the recipe! I usually have trouble with any sort of white sauce but this turned out nice (not like my usual glue). It was a great way to use our holiday leftovers and I appreciate that the ingredients were simple.
1273499,28377,2014-04-25,5,"This was a great soup that the whole family loved.  I even made it all backwards bc I started with frozen chicken. I&#039;ll write what I did so you can feel confident that it will still taste great even if you can&#039;t follow it to a T.  I put my frozen chicken in the broth and boiled until nearly done.  Added the peanut oil, garlic, ginger, and pepper flakes.  I added carrots.  I only had dried basil so I added that now and cooked until carrots were done.  At the last minute I added the onions and cilantro, which I only had frozen and not fresh.  Cooked them for a minute and added the fish sauce.  Served over rice.  Totally awesome fast pho."
500671,140134,2010-11-18,5,This was so cute!  I added 2 Tbsp of Ranch powder to the mix b/c I served jalapeno chips with it.  Jalapeno tortilla chips are green already so I didn't have to dye the chips. :)  Everyone loved it.
182010,93727,2007-07-25,5,"If I could, I'd give this ten stars. The carmelization of the shallots and then the vinegar reduction is simply brilliant! Because of what I had on hand, I used sherry vinegar and cilantro instead of dill and served my lovely beans (from the organic farm) over baby greens and herbs. Fantastic! I will be making this over and over again."
442988,102274,2008-05-08,5,"This may be the best soup I have ever had.  I expected it to be good, but it was FABULOUS.  I LOVE THIS SOUP!!!!  I made it exactly as written, except for having to use red bell pepper instead of green (it's what I had).  Used Penzey's medium-strength chili powder.  Thank you so very, very much for posting this!"
40620,35368,2003-03-03,5,"This was a wonderful recipe everyone in the family loved! Put it over tortilla chips with sour cream and lettuce. It was a nice spicy, enough to make your tongue tingle. But not so much to make your nose run. I used 16 ounces of tomato sauce instead of the tomato juice, a 10 ounce can of Rotel tomatoes and green chiles instead of the tomatoes and jalapenos, and added a 15 ounce can of black beans plus the liquid in it.  Didn't add the bell pepper since I don't care for them and stirred the cheese into it instead of putting it on top. This WILL be in my regular recipes for my family! Thank you!"
174711,283551,2008-03-10,4,"Excellent! Vegetarian kid loved these. He likes the ""tooth"" and says the flavor is better than any purchased meat substitute. This evening we will try using one of them with a caramelized onion and mushroom sauce.
I doubled the recipe. Put liquid ingredients, oil and chickpeas in the blender and pulsed until smooth. Then added the flavorings. Pulsed until the flavors mixed in and turned the batter out onto the counter to knead in the wheat gluten and crumbs. It was very stiff so I used a rolling pin to flatten it, then shaped it into ""chop"" shapes. Browned until partially cooked and froze.
I plan on making this again only leaving out the soy sauce. I suspect that they will work nicely breaded or grilled and should be a bit more versatile when saucing.
Thanks so much for this. It is some work but very definitely worth it."
1107439,55673,2009-10-20,5,This is an easy and delicious recipe; a definite keeper! I make it with boneless breasts and reduce cooking time by 5-10min.
542159,482418,2013-01-27,5,"A wonderfully quick and easy side with a nice Asian flavor, I may have used a little more sesame oil than called for. Thanks for the post."
79772,63363,2004-06-02,1,"I love hot and sweet things like mango curry etc. Being an Indian, love curries. But this unique recipe was not to our liking. Did not go well with rice or naans. "
68884,115009,2006-02-12,5,"A great twist on egg salad. The green olives add a little salty bite, but they are not overpowering at all. I used a spicy brown mustard, so I left out the onion powder. I made the sandwiches on toasted whole-grain with a slice of crisp lettuce. I really enjoyed this. I got 3 big sandwiches out of the mixture."
1410967,162194,2011-10-05,4,"This was really good! I did make some alterations to this recipe, based on the taste preferences of my fiance. Made strictly to the recipe, this is a good dish, but it does taste pretty strongly of sour cream. I tried a little taste before putting it into the oven, and knew it wasn't going to fly, so I added some diced jalapenos, some paprika, and the rest of the 28 oz can of green enchilada sauce. (I used one 28 oz can TOTAL, not in addition to what was already in the recipe.) I just kept tasting it, then adding more spice as needed. I also grated the second half of the block of monterey jack to sprinkle over the top, before it went into the oven. An entire 1 lb block of cheese went into this baby, but with those changes, I thought it tasted much more southwestern. It can feed an army. Exactly what we were looking for. Thank you so much for this recipe! Will make again."
65573,305524,2008-09-05,5,These were very good! I like how quick they were to make. They had a strong parmesan flavor. We served them alongside spaghetti and dipped them in the leftover sauce. We will make these again. Thanks for posting! Made for PRMR tag game.
36944,34922,2004-07-24,5,Easy to put together and it resulted in a very colorful and wonderfully flavorful fritter.  I halved the recipe and other than that I followed it exactly as written.  The only change I might make next time is to add some four blend mexican cheese to the batter.  Thanks NurseDi for another yummy recipe!
152393,102067,2005-03-30,5,"This pie is delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the cheese.  ""someone"" had broken into my swiss cheese so I used mostly swiss and finished it off with cheddar.  This was so easy and everyone loved it.  Served with a salad it is the perfect way to use up Easter ham left-overs.  Thanks newspapergal for this great new favorite!"
724631,337208,2008-12-14,4,"4 Stars, a tasty budget dish -- a different way to serve sandwiches. Most people would want to increase the number of ingredients, but the recipe as written stretches out the ingredients to their maximum. I lined up my pieces of bread, so it looked to me like 6 sandwiches in the 9x13 pan. Serve these with soup, and you have a gussied up ""soup and sandwich"". Of all the ingredients, I would try to do without the cream cheese, but then I wouldn't have much of the strata effect. Personally I would use a lot of shredded Swiss cheese to replace the cheddar and cream cheese, and I would then also use rye bread -- cuz I am a ""ham n' Swiss on rye"" kind of gal. Overall I enjoyed this, especially the broccoli and ham, and it was very quick and easy to put together. Remade and photographed this 12.14.08 substituting rye bread, asparagus, and Swiss cheese, eliminating the cream cheese, and adding accents of fire-roasted red bell pepper for contrast - heavenly!  Thanks for posting, 2Bleu. Made for Please Review My Recipe."
292000,28023,2008-12-07,3,"3/24/06 I'm not sure what I did wrong. The texture was too gummy and doughy, as opposed to flaky or crumbly which I normally think shortbread should be. Also, even though I added extra lemon juice, the flavor was very muted and didn't really come through. However, given the success that people have had with this recipe, I will try it again and re-review it. *EDIT* 12/6/08 The first time I made this recipe I was a novice, so I made the mistake of making the cookies too big and therefore they did not cook up properly. This second time the texture was perfect, however I still had the same issue with the muted flavor. I really want a very lemony cookie, and as written this recipe is not it. I'm going to try it a third time, this time using lemon extract and more of it."
245408,248020,2007-10-17,4,Great way to sneak some protein into french toast! I also added some flaxseed meal to add to the fiber. My boys (5 & 2) were none the wiser! I will make these again! Thanks!
147145,118258,2009-09-24,5,"Made a batch of this last night, it was terrific! It was easy to make and tasted great in the kale bean soup I made. My quantities were a little different based on what I had - a little over 2lbs of chicken drumsticks, 2 carrots, 2 celery sticks, 1 large onion and a few more peppercorns. I also threw in a sprig of fresh thyme and covered it with enough water to fit into my 6qt cooker. Yield was about 8 cups. Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Kittencal!"
123938,87822,2004-04-02,4,"Great recipe!  Prepared as instructed.  Next time I might mix the salt, pepper and sage in the flour instead of the egg/milk becuase the seasoning didn't stick to the pork.  I also doctored the gravy with beef bouillon and more sage because it tasted like grease (note:  my ""pan drippings"" were mostly grease because frying them in 1/2"" of oil).  I also doctored the apples up with a little cinnamon, they didn't need it, but I couldn't resist.  I will make this again, but will cut down the amount of frying oil.  Thanks!"
97901,78697,2006-02-06,4,Made these for our Super Bowl party. they were easy to do. I left out the green chilies and added a little extra hot sauce. Very tasty.
22015,195111,2006-11-28,5,I made this for Thanksgiving using Splenda.  It was well like by my family who tried it (a couple wouldn't but that's okay)   I've done mulled cider somewhat like this but this was the first time with the wine and tea.   I will be making it again.   Thanks!
446738,33671,2007-03-27,5,I have made this recipe a few times now and it is always fabulous.  And so easy!  Last time I also poured in a can of beer for a different flavor and it came out great.
51011,93930,2005-08-13,5,"To be honest, I really do not care for broccoli.  A co-worker brought this for lunch last week, and she told me I had to try it.  YUM!! It looks and tastes so good, yet it is easy to make.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, now I can make it for my dh."
364433,206291,2007-02-13,4,"I was amazed at how the sauce became nice and thick! This was a good recipe, and different from what I usually eat so that was nice too. I would even consider trying to recipe next time without adding the wine and chicken broth because at that part of the recipe, the chicken looked and smelled delicious."
2001377584,87532,2017-06-25,3,"First, I used thighs instead of breasts since that's what I had. I used 5, since I'm feeding 5 adults. I browned them before I put them in the slow cooker. I ended up using 10 red potatoes because there is no way 4 will feed 5 adults. I used 12 cloves of garlic and the garlic flavor was still fairly weak to us. I did use the full amount of melted butter and honey, and didn't find it too sweet. I tossed in an onion because it looked like it was going to be too bland. Since I didn't have lemon pepper, I added a 1/2 tsp turmeric, probably 1 T or so of ground black pepper, and 2 c chicken broth. I cooked it on low for 8 hours, and then pulled all the liquid out and moved it over to the stove. I made a roux and used the liquid to make gravy. I ended up adding another cup of chicken broth to extend it. To the gravy I added a 1/2 tsp of turmeric, a tsp of poultry seasoning, 1 T granulated garlic, and 1 T granulated onion before serving. It was okay, but the chicken ended out too dry. I'm going to try cooking it for a little less time next time, probably 6-7 hours instead of the full 8."
340141,193115,2006-12-04,4,"Very delicious!  I can't have berries or nuts so I left those out.  When I put in the pears, they released their juices and what was going to be glaze turned into a sauce.  I probably should have reduced it, but I couldn't wait.  My guest really enjoyed this dish too.  Thank you for a great new way to eat these veges."
511388,33489,2008-10-06,5,"Great coleslaw. Perfect flavor, and easy to make!"
1811798,329341,2012-08-21,5,"soooo good, im not an apple pie fan, my husband is, I made this and its delicious!! reminds me of the cracker barrels apple dunpling, I served it with vanilla ice cream, and when i made it I used a deep dish pie plate.. I made it with the amount of spices used in recipie my hubby likes it that way , will make again, and I never use a recipie for my pie as I am an advanced baker and have been making apple pies for 22 yrs, scince I was 10..they were my pepe's favorite and he would have loved this, I highly recommend it, only issue is it does make a lot of crumble topping, but it's oh so good!!"
50969,101673,2007-12-31,3,"I made these on 12/28/07 for my SO and myself.And we both came to the agreement that neither one of us could taste the flavor of the meat,because the combination of the spices and seasonings were too overpowering.But I will have to say that the meat was very moist.Anyway,thanks for posting,and ""Keep Smiling:)"""
1928374,92118,2011-06-09,0,"I will quote my husband after having taken a bite of this casserole, ""I could eat this all night!"" I followed the recipe fairly closely and the finished product was very creamy, so I put it over spiral garden pasta. Superb! We are growing our own squash, carrots and onions, so I anticipate making this often this summer."
520493,184693,2008-03-03,5,"I served these for a dinner party this weekend and they were a hit!
Everyone thought I was gourmet.
They went together quickly and were way easier to serve than regular lasagna.
Thanks for sharing!"
89831,279904,2008-05-26,5,"very good! I used canned baby shrimp for this and added in 2 teaspoon fresh minced garlic and Tabasco in place of the cayenne, the longer this chills the better the flavor, thanks for sharing Brook!"
226863,370736,2009-06-12,5,"I was really surprised by the taste of this recipe...I expected a much stronger parmesan cheese flavor, but it was very subtle. The egg made the flour and parmesan mixture stick perfectly to the fish, and the melted butter and oil allowed the fish to soak up a wonderful buttery taste, while allowing it to be slightly crispy. The macadamia nuts were a perfect complement to the fish. I used tilapia, because thats what I had on hand.  I enjoyed a nice Pinot Grigio with this fish. Thanks so much for posting. I will make this easy recipe again. Made for ZWT5 for the Saucy Senoritas."
2001053494,54269,2016-06-17,5,I think the reason that this extender works is because if you notice they have made the cake mixes smaller now. Some are just 15 or 16 ounces when they used to be 18-ounce cake mix. Thank you for posting this.
215898,129186,2006-09-17,5,"Wow!  We used fresh pineapple and cooked them on the barbeque, and everyone loved them!  Since we put them directly on the grill, there was syrup-sugar sauce left over which we poured back over the pineapple to serve.  Served that way it didn't need any other toppings, but next time I may add the ice cream as it sounds delicious."
2002339812,101954,2018-11-19,5,"Loved this recipe. I used light corn syrup, half white sugar and half brown sugar, 2 tsp cornstarch and a pinch of salt."
1668786,163419,2010-11-24,4,"My bf & I love PB & banana sandwiches and so I was very excited to try this recipe. I liked it a lot. It was very, very easy to make & baked up perfectly.  I baked it for exactly 20 mins & it was perfectly done.  The texture was cake like. I am only giving it 4 stars because the flavor was very subtle. I did double the amount of peanut butter and used crunchy natural peanut butter and still thought that it could use more peanut butter.  I think with the addition of peanut butter, I should've added some more banana as well.  I did like that it was a little sweet and it didn't have that artificial sugar substitute taste that so many diabetic friendly recipes have. Overall it was very good and I will definately make it again."
190402,76491,2011-03-29,5,"This is a really good chocolate pudding.  However, after making it several times, I find that using a hand held electric mixer makes a big difference (as opposed to a whisk).  This will probably take care of the consistency issues some mentioned in their review :). Thanks for sharing!"
305187,196305,2007-03-26,5,"I cannot believe this is not reviewed more! The jambalya mix is perfect, the flavor combination, the heat of it...I was going for a quick version and just used smoked sausage but wow!! Too spicy for the kids but husband and I loved it, makes you sweat! It makes enough for about 4 big servings, I divide it just before adding the sausage and put half in the freezer. The longer you let it boil with the sausage/chicken/shrimp, the better. I will absolutely use this all the time. Thank you!"
307059,381868,2009-09-04,5,"Very Good!  We all enjoyed it.    The only thing I did different was I added about a cup of chopped walnuts.
Thanks for sharing."
125458,64617,2005-01-04,5,"the name of this dish is surely not a misnomer! i took plenty creative licence with the veggies in this - tossed in a lot of veggies that i had on hand like green beans, shredded cabbage, peas, lima beans, sweetcorn and potatoes, so it was truly a veg biryani. i think with this kind of dish, there can be no strict guide on the spices, you just have to adjust accordingly - i grew up with spicy food so prefer more heat in my dishes. i served this with split pea dal and raita and i grudgingly have left some for my husbands lunch tomorrow. thanks for posting."
932618,22562,2008-10-23,2,"It didn't taste anything like a belgian waffle to me. It wasn't crispy like a waffle (1/2 c. water made a very thick batter so I added a little more, maybe it was supposed to be that thick?). It was fine but I think I'll stick to regular pancakes in a frying pan."
1371168,277086,2009-09-01,0,"I tried this recipe because it is low fat, and I would not make it again!  The crust was soggy and hard to get out of the pan.  I baked it for 8 minutes and cooled before adding the filling for a key lime pie.  Overall, the crust got soggy."
961542,21761,2011-02-20,5,My 2 cents worth here... Deeeeeelicious!
11461,137144,2009-11-10,5,"Not wanting our carrots taste steamed, I cooked them for the first twenty minutes without any lid.  During the last forty minutes, I added a loosly fitting piece of aluminum foil that would let steam out.  I did stir the carrots as mentioned.  They turned out to be delicious!  We'll be cooking carrots this way again often!  Thank you!"
246293,108361,2007-03-08,3,"Just made this, and it had great texture and flavor. Thanks for the recipe!"
2667977,494429,2013-01-30,5,The mixture of the ranch with the hot pepper sauce give it a nice kick.
223898,267827,2007-12-16,5,I made these exactly as posted. I did use the mini chocolate chips.  These cookies are outstanding. I made a batch to give to a friend and had to make another batch for myself.
350750,19023,2012-01-13,5,"Made this to go into the crock pot for shredded chicken sandwiches.  I shouldn't have simmered and then put into crock pot.  I grated the onion and skipped the saute.  Sure was tasty, thanks!"
280605,102886,2008-02-02,5,"I forgot to rate these!  Made them up ahead of time for Christmas morning!  They were awesome.  Easy to make, my son helped roll out the bread.  Made lots so this morning I pulled out the rest to have for breakfast.  Very nice recipe, its a keeper!"
313633,152964,2007-08-06,5,yummy We made six lbs last night and it all went. Thanks
131611,84247,2009-11-07,5,This was excellent and easy!  The only thing I did differently was turn the chicken over half-way through the cooking time.
312322,83807,2009-08-30,4,"I like this recipe very much. However, it did not get passed by my teens which is why I did not rate it 5 out of 5. I am glad to have learned a new method, I may be able to apply it to other vegs. I did have quite a bit of crumb mixture left over so I may try it on some button mushrooms."
1374981,378943,2012-07-09,5,These were awesome! I was looking for something to use for my son's Dr Seuss themed birthday party. We used your cookies for Yertle the Turtle. Super easy and so yummy! These were a bigger hit than the cupcakes. And I had a ton of people ask for the recipe. Thank you so much for sharing!
226863,502812,2014-12-18,5,"I made this as posted, except I used olive salad from Central Grocery in New Orleans instead of the pickled veggies and olives.  I was able to pick up pizza dough at the Publix bakery, so this was a breeze to make.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing!  Made for your win in Football Pool, Week 15, 2014 at Yuku.com"
269480,108502,2008-10-01,0,Thanks for sharing with us what a Sai Ling Mung Ching Gai tastes like. It sure was lemony! So exotic steaming the dish this way as we're used to using the bamboo steamer for dimsums or fish with it. I'll lessen the  soy sauce and salt next time as the soy is already salty. Had this for dinner the other night. Thanks! Made for PAC Fall baby 2008.
60992,253576,2009-07-20,5,This was really good! I had about 5 leftover grilled fresh kielbasa I used instead of the brats. The only thing I did differently was add some garlic powder and pepper to it along with an extra can of green beans to make it more of a main dish instead of a stew. The family said it reminded they thought it was kinda like a twist on tator tot casserole in flavor. You can't beat the speed that this goes together in and that you can come home after being gone for hours to a hearty comforting meal. I can see this going on the menu plan again!
374416,334017,2008-11-20,5,"This is a delicious sweet bread!  I like the apple-maple flavor, and the nutty topping adds an extra wow factor.  Thanks Jim!"
614591,197712,2011-08-04,5,"I was in a hurry tonight for dinner and wanted to find something to jazz up pork chops that was quick and easy.  I googled ""seasoning for pork chops"" and this recipe was one that came up.  So I decided to try it.  It was a hit!! It was quick and easy.  I grilled it on the bbq and it turned out great.  I had thicker chops but it worked just fine!  It provided just enough spice to the meat without overpowering it....both my hubby and 13 yr-old son that it was great!!  I did not add the white pepper this time, but for sure next time I will try it.  I will be keeping this recipe on file.  THANKS for a simple yet flavorful recipe!!"
209747,26091,2006-11-27,5,This was a wonderful addition to our holiday meal. What a yummy dish! Tasted like a great sweet potato pie without the crust. YUMMM! Thanks Di for a wonderful recipe that will be enjoyed in our home for many meals to come!
238113,103679,2008-02-28,5,We really liked this- very thick and  creamy.  I also added a little water at the end just for our preference but otherwise made just as written.  Thanks!
526804,123522,2011-08-25,5,Please EVERYONE try this!!  Taste just like the real thing for soo much cheaper.  My favorite recipe:)
283390,64664,2006-10-01,5,"I loved this! It's a little bit labor-intensive, but I think the results are worth it. These have the perfect amount of sweetness and tartness, and the little serving size is just right. I had debated leaving in the zest, but I'm glad I strained it out...the smooth texture of the custards is really nice. I didn't include the optional fruit garnishes, and I think the custards stand well on their own. Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
482933,177839,2008-07-27,5,"I do not know if mine look correct, but they sure did taste great!  Just the right amount of salt, too.   I ran out of whole wheat so used about 3/4 cup of all purpose white flour and seemed to be fine.  This pulled together fast-timing is right on. Thanks littleturtle for sharing a wonderful bread. Made for All New Zaar Cookbook tag."
42720,86665,2004-09-04,5,"After searching high and low for capers (I was determined to try this recipe!) I finally made this bread. It is very easy to put the spread ingredients together.  I bought a loaf of Italian bread but next time I will make my own.  This bread is so delicious it will knock your socks off!  It could easily be a side dish for soups or spaghetti/pasta dishes or even an appetizer.  Mickie, thanks so much for posting this wonderful recipe!
"
604906,6627,2012-01-20,4,"I subbed applesauce for the butter, used Gala apples, added cinnamon, nutmeg & cardamom; used Sucanat and cut the sugar in half, used 1/2 ww flour and 1/4 cup wheat germ. Made four small loaves. wish I had remembered to add some salt, but very tasty."
522275,48917,2009-11-28,5,"DELICIOUS!  When making the stock, I added in some onion, carrot, and celery for some extra flavor; also our turkey was smoked, so I think that added even more great flavors to the broth/soup.  I used 1 onion, 3 carrots, 3 celery stalks, and 1 large clove of garlic; sauteed them in some olive oil for a few minutes before adding the stock and rice.  Also, I used 1 cup of flour (instead of the 1 1/2 cup) and the consistency was perfect.  Used 1/2 cup wild rice (uncooked; w/out the seasoning packet) and also used 1 1/2 cups whole milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream as I didn't have any half-and-half.  Will definitely be making this a permanent after-Thanksgiving-tradition for our family! :)"
37449,225223,2008-04-21,5,"Very satisfying dish! I didn't have fresh basil, so used dried. I really enjoyed this! Thanks! Made for Pick a Chef(PAC)."

797028,13464,2008-10-28,5,"I made this as a side dish with Beth's Melt in Your Mouth Ribs (#107786) and Hush Puppies (#53304). This was a delicious and simple recipe. I made was with 1# mild sausage and 1# Johnsonville HOT Italian brats. I boiled the brats first for 15 minutes then browned in a skillet, sliced, and added to the rice mixture. I also doubled the vegetables. Everyone loved it and the leftovers were quickly reserved for lunches. Thanks Rhonda."
199848,167011,2009-05-24,5,"Very good!  A lovely twist on traditional clam dip.  I made this as written, only adding bsome minced garlic.  Loved it.  I'll make this again.  Thanx!"
855155,253141,2010-05-01,5,Ususally I am not fond of cauliflower but this was a good recipe. Everyone enjoyed it. DH said that if his mother had made cauliflower like this when he was a kid he would have been willing to eat it all the time. :) I will be making this again.
916602,80482,2016-07-31,5,"Delicious! I made the recipe as written. I did, however do a mixed berry with raspberries, berries and blackberries. It was runny a bit so next time I would thicken a bit more."
244064,68159,2007-08-19,4,Yummy yummy!!  We really enjoyed these.  I know the recipe says the quality of the potatoes is a prime factor but I used old red spuds and it was still great.  Mmmm mmmm good!
261216,108908,2011-08-26,0,"Husband LOVED it. Said it reminded him of what he had as a kid - only MUCH better and MUCH fresher. Will make a again. Served over white rice - lots of juice, which made it kind of like a soup - which we liked."
705794,76012,2008-01-10,5,"YUMMY!!!! my husband loves it so much. made according to the recipe and it turned out GREAT!!!!!! cant ask for more. my husband like it the original and will put more chinese sausage next time. 
very easy to make!! 
thanks for the recipe."
52543,64585,2004-04-05,5,Delicious! I sliced cinnamon raisin bread very thick & served it with fresh fruit & coffee on Sunday morning. Thanx Marie! 
64583,17475,2003-07-01,5,"I have never cared for cottage cheese before, but I wanted to try this after all the great reviews.  I used whole wheat toast and regular sugar instead of sweetener and I loved it!  I am definitely going to have this for breakfast often.  Thanks!"
628076,218589,2008-11-13,5,This is a great cake decorating frosting. I made 4 times as much as the recipe called for and it was not only a breeze to make but a breeze to color and use. The best thing about it is that it isn't too sweet. So even a large piece of Elmo cake didn't taste like a glob of frosting with a wee bit of cake ... Thanks Grammie Bea!
372755,162393,2006-11-13,4,Really great and easy recipe. Made it with the sauted shrimp #372755 and some steamed rice. The whole family loved it.
225179,30988,2005-07-03,5,I used half the slaw as suggested in M. Joan's review and it was great.
2319997,251639,2012-07-29,5,Had these years ago at SirLoin in Hilliard. These are the Best! Thanks for the recipe.
198601,59853,2008-08-08,5,"Good recipe to use up zucchini.  It wasn't too difficult to make, and a good way to use stuff up!"
456583,149340,2007-02-25,4,"This recipe was very good and not difficult to make. I didn't have espresso powder, so I did without and it was still fabulous.  It has a very DARK chocolate taste and is extremely rich!  This is something you eat slowly to savor the texture and flavor.  My kids loved it, too.  Fabulous!"
169430,502956,2013-09-05,5,"This made a perfect chilled dinner last evening. I made it up in the early morning and just placed it on a crisp leaf of green leaf lettuce. Dee, you&#039;ve done it again. This is delicious and satisfying and simply ideal for the summer heat. Made as written and wouldn&#039;t change anything."
52543,124865,2005-07-11,4,"This was certainly a tasty salad but I could taste the corn starch in the dressing. When I make this next time, I'll use half the amount specified. Since I was out of raisins, I used seedless green grapes which I cut in half. I'm sure their juice made a nice addition to the dressing. I omitted the mushrooms as one of my guests hates them - but I won't do that next time. Thanx for another repeater Carol! "
476076,82276,2007-06-01,4,"This is a very good recipe but I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a little too wet for me.  I made it a second time and drained my black beans and used 6 oz. of tomato paste insteas of sauce.  This came out just the way I like it, scoup-a-ble!  I got the tomato sauce recipe idea from another recipe that I love a lot."
517066,102369,2009-01-09,5,Awesome recipe..I used this as a coffee ice cream recipe only so I omitted the candy bars and almonds and I used 2 Tablespoons Coffee to 1 1/2 teaspoon of water. It came out perfectly perfect and had an AWESOME flavor...I love the Blue Bell Coffee ice cream but its so outrageously priced...with this recipe I will never have to buy it again! thanks!
1934198,135198,2011-06-17,4,"I added about a teaspoon of fresh grated lemon zest, and it really brightened the blueberry flavor of this cake, without turning it lemony.  That one little tweak makes an amazing difference."
329600,97340,2009-06-03,5,"A winner! Although I might have left the chicken on a bit longer (30 minutes on indirect heat), it still came out tasting and looking great. Based on comments made by reviewers, I made a few substitutions (honey for sugar, onion salt for seasoning salt, garlic for garlic powder) and additions (a bit of sesame oil and chili flakes). I also chilled the chicken in the marinade for 8 hours. Thanks Rita."
113517,7223,2005-09-05,5,"fantabulous!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, omitting the onion because I was too lazy to chop.  These were easy and so tasty.  I mashed my eggplant in a colander over the sink and the batter was still running but they turned out wonderful."
153067,300796,2008-06-23,5,This was amazingly simple and extremely yummy!!!  I put it right on hamburger buns.  What a keeper!  Thank you for sharing!  LA :-)
129958,154675,2008-11-29,5,"This was delicious! I served it with Garden Salsa Sun Chips.  It really does taste like the toppings on a baked potato.  In fact, the remainder of the dip was taken home by my best friend to use on baked potatoes.  I did prepare this as directed.  This is certainly a keeper and will be repeated often.  Thanks Baby Chevelle!"
488441,505497,2013-12-31,5,"Really easy. Really tasty. Should be a hit with kids, too! Made for Football Pool 2013"
1589214,393639,2010-04-09,5,"Excellent loaf!  I used only the dough cycle on my breadmaker, then punched it down, dusted it with flour & gave it a quick knead.  Shaped a rustic loaf and left it to rise 45 mins on an oiled tray sprinkled with polenta/cornmeal.  Baked about 25 mins in a moderate oven - delish!   Just made a few slight modifications, used honey instead of molasses, and only 1 tablespoon of it (don't like my bread too sweet), used 1 and 1/2 cups tepid water, and brushed loaf with milk and sprinkled lightly with polenta before baking.  Thanks Marg, a real stayer.... Just look how great it looks!"
216321,342,2006-01-31,5,Loved the way this tasted. The little bit of sugar and cream added a big bunch of flavor. I'm confused as to the previous reviews. What bacon grease? I read the orignial recipe over and over and didn't see the use of bacon. I didn't use any.
1449642,99511,2009-11-16,4,"This is the closest I've found to a favorite dish from the old Eddoko restaurant in Berkeley. When the owners retired, so did the dish! It's a great cold-weather dinner. I'd suggest using less soy sauce and sugar at first--you can always add more after tasting. You can also add a Tb. of Mirin, sake, or even marsala for extra flavor."
28177,16970,2010-10-13,4,"Surprisingly good, but we felt the flavor was missing a little something in the apple/onion mixture.  I'll definitely make this again, but I think the onions may add a lot more flavor if they're allowed to caramelize before the rest of the ingredients are added.  I really liked how easy this recipe was on a weeknight and a healthier way to get apples into the family without having to use them for dessert.  :)  Thanks for posting, Derf!  Made & enjoyed for the Diabetic Forum's Harvest Moon Apple Festival tag game."
323328,63263,2009-02-01,4,"I imagine these vary quite a bit depending on your granola.  They were good, but I could stand them to be a little sweeter.  I might try next time to substitute applesauce for the oil."
15712,48589,2003-11-12,5,I made this with a class of 4th graders.  It was straight-forward and the kids loved it.  One child said he didn't want any but changed his mind when he heard the others rave.  He ended up having seconds.  The area around the kitchen smelled so wonderful that several teachers peeked in to see what we were making!  Thanks for a great recipe.  We did not use milk since two of the kids are allergic but beat in water instead.  
9869,33875,2002-10-22,5,"I used boneless chicken thighs for this mix and poured 1/4 cup melted butter over the fillets before baking for approx 40 minutes.
Great flavours and a nice crispy coating, thanks for posting."
135887,219563,2011-07-22,5,Delicious......I used multi-grain bread and grilled it.
2420391,486496,2012-09-27,5,"Made this for my boyfriend, and he loved it, which is very rare with my cooking! Easy recipe to follow, very original and a cool touch of home in a foreign country."
1525071,52704,2010-01-22,5,I make this all the time in the summer. I leave out the onion though. Very good.
1278767,126279,2009-05-26,3,The recipe should include draining the ricotta in cheesecloth overnight or it is way too runny. In addition I suggest putting a round piece of wax paper or parchment on the bottom of the springform before putting the batter in the pan to prevent burning. One sixteen ounce container of ricotta is plenty with 8 ounces of cream cheese.
54874,29939,2002-10-27,5,"This was definitely a winner in our house. I used a combination of sliced apples, peaches and raisins. Served it piping hot with vanilla icecream - what a hit it was!! Thanks "
169430,387874,2013-05-10,5,"Photo may be seen here (in Savor): www.annacia.com. DH and both feel that this is one of the best potato soups we have ever had. I didn&#039;t use any sausage and in place of the half and half I added about 1 1/4 cups of heavy cream (leftover from Christmas that had passed it&#039;s date -still good though- and had to be used) which likely had something to do with the excellence of the soup,lol. Honestly, it was something that you would expect in an expensive restaurant. I topped mine with sliced green onion and some black pepper. This is going into my Favorites of 2013 cookbook right now and I will most certainly be making it many times again (DH even ask me to print the recipe so that he can make it!!!!)"
290920,150863,2011-12-04,5,"I found this recipe right when it was added to this website.  I had just been married almost  a year.  I was still new to cooking.   My husband loved it!   That was about 6 years ago and we still make this all of the time.   If I ever have half and half or Heavy cream left over from something else,  I will add a little of that to make it a little more creamy and more fattening =)  I also always add bacon and a can of corn.   Thanks for sharing this recipe!"
170628,50692,2005-02-12,3,"An ok sauce....a little salty and not much complexity in flavor.  I needed extra sugar, rice wine vinegar and a splash of cider vinegar.  I also added chopped fresh ginger and extra garlic."
493088,191816,2010-05-29,5,"This is REALLY good. My husband doesn't like pork, but loves this. I used apple cider instead of cider vinegar, and we grilled it. Soooo good."
544754,210365,2009-01-26,4,"My co-worker always brings this to our potlucks in a huge crock pot, along with some Beano for us to take beforehand, LOL. It's a nice dip but I think she omits the milk entirely."
431813,253459,2008-11-10,5,"Very tasty, fresh salad!  I used a generous amount of sea salt, and I went with 2 teaspoons of honey.  I'm serving this tonight with some teriyaki marinated tuna steaks.  Can't wait for dinner!  Thanks Peggy!"
185387,106261,2005-02-19,5,"Great recipe thanks and another hit with the family. I usually boil my chicken and add chicken bouillion cubes which I did add to your recipe and when I make mine I used rheames egg noodles, the frozen ones but I wanted something different and this was great. 
Thanks again.
:)"
368897,14187,2010-08-10,5,"OMG this is the best pumpkin bread I have ever had!! I made this in a muffin tin and drizzled a tiny bit of white icing on top.  This recipe couldn't be much easier!  I just had one with my breakfast and they are beyond delicious!  The texture of these is amazing and the taste is PERFECT! I can't wait to make these for the holiday season. Oh, and I didn't have any coconut pudding so I used french vanilla.  Since they came out so yummy I think I'll continue to use the french vanilla when I make them again.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe :-)"
337668,306814,2008-07-06,3,"This ended up being a little salty for my tastes.  I tried it with crackers and chips, but it ended up being the best with pita bread.  I think this would be wonderful on gyros or other sandwiches where feta adds flavor."
20480,83200,2007-06-06,5,"What a great recipe and so easy. I also went Cilantro's way:regular musroom soup, soda crackers(that's what I had) and only added 1/4 cup water. Thanks for posting.
Rita"
1173385,10589,2009-05-12,5,"I took goodmorningburger's lead and left out the cheddar except I left the recipe instead of halfing it, and added 2 tsp vanilla and topped with sugar, they turned out great. thanks."
174096,517878,2014-08-21,5,"Easy, quick, and delicious! This made four servings for us when paired with some salad and fruit. Thanks for sharing! Culinary Quest &#039;14"
1356721,91509,2012-07-08,5,"Loved this super yummy stew!!  I used chipotle peppers instead of the red chili and it turned out great.  I did add a bit extra broth as I needed to use it up and my veggies were abnormally large.  I had mine with avocado and cilantro and crumbled some tortilla chips on top, loved it!!"
2001705222,294620,2017-09-07,1,"I love Cole slaw, but this was a horrible recipe. It does not taste right. Very bland. It tastes like mayo. I added more vinegar, a pinch of salt, a little celery seed, but it was still not very good. It did make it edible though. I will never make this again! Yuck!"
1535,162765,2014-06-20,4,"Sorry, but wasn&#039;t impressed. My squash took forever to cook (55-60 minutes) and none of us thought it tasted better or had a better consistency than when I cook it in the microwave. There&#039;s nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with the recipe hence the 4 stars. I just don&#039;t like to run my oven for an hour when I can get the same results in the microwave in 15 minutes.  I will be using Recipe #77554 again from now on."
58439,40091,2007-03-29,4,"LOVED this and is a comfort food too!
Used hickory smoked BBQ sauce too!
Saute onions and peppers in little chicken broth, yes!
Is this a FUN recipe to make? GUESS!"
2340538,28891,2012-07-24,5,"Great recipe!  The muffins were soft and flavorful.  I will definitely come back to this one!<br/>I used 1 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract as I didn't have any almond extract, still worked very well.  I had about 1 3/4 cups of fresh cherries, so I used those instead of frozen--love the flavor, and still plenty of cherries.  I look forward to trying them with the almond!"
837304,150863,2012-03-13,3,"I tried this recipe instead of my usual potato soup recipe that calls for heavy cream.  I like this soup and will probably make it again,  but it wasn't anything spectacular.  <br/>Following the recipe exactly as stated, except to add more onions (sauteed).  I did find it very watery, so I added quite a bit of instant potato flakes to thicken it up.  Everyone that tried it said that they liked it.  It was a bit spicier than my usual potato soup, but I enjoyed the little bit of kick."
567310,79606,2011-08-19,5,"quick, easy, tasty!"
440324,266209,2009-02-28,5,"My BF is Lebanese, and he really enjoyed these. I made them with just a simple homemade marinara sauce on the side, for dipping. I redeemed myself for the last time I tried to make ""kofta"". Thank you."
1600977,428576,2010-08-05,4,"This is a wonderful, sweet and moist banana bread. However, I had problems with the ingredients. I added an egg and 1/4 cup milk to the batter, otherwise it would not have been a batter. It was much too dry and crumbly. After adding the two extra ingredients, it was perfect, and the bread turned out fabulous. I left out the chocolate chips and used xylitol instead of sugar. The gluten free flours used: 1/4 cup buckwheat, 1/4 cup sorghum, 1/2 cup brown rice. This combination tends to work out in many baked goods for me and tastes amazing. I have baked the batter in muffin tins to make muffins the second time around; they came out nicely!"
1090100,141077,2009-03-10,4,"Good weeknight dessert for the family.  I've made it using different flavour combinations of jello (raspberry/strawberry, lime/orange-pineapple - basically whatever I had on hand).  I've also made it with prepared Dream Whip when I didn't have Cool Whip, and it turned out just fine.  Easy and yummy!"
844554,407186,2011-04-24,5,I cut this way down for 2 chicken breasts. It was delicious! I didn't have fresh oregano so used dried and left out seasoning salt. We're reducing salt where we can. I will be using this one again! Made for Zaar's Newest Tag Game 2011.
1023733,153483,2009-11-02,5,"Being from the piedmont area of NC I grew up on sugar cake.  This is a delicious new twist on an old favorite when adding the cream cheese filling.  The best part is the recipe is quick, easy and boy is it good!"
343958,139694,2007-12-25,4,"This is the 2nd time that I've made these, I thought I posted the review but I didn't. These looked great in the gift baskets that I made for family members. 

Thanx Karen."
593927,204276,2010-03-14,5,"I was going to rate this 4 stars until I added about triple the amount of milk to mine, I used plain rice milk to be dairy free. I sweetened with white sugar and used vanilla paste. DD (toddler) loved this with additional plain rice milk to cool it down."
223979,173889,2006-07-16,5,"This was great!  I had to serve it before dinner because we had a lot of recipes to cover, but it was just the right pick me up to get cooking for the world tour.  I will definitely make this again.
Thanks!"
428060,135267,2013-03-14,4,"This is chicken and dumplings, not pot pie. This was very good. I prepared the recipe as listed except I substituted a parsnip for a carrot."
48136,4285,2003-08-01,4,"This was good. Tasty, simple, very quick and easy. Thanks!"
279205,140643,2007-04-16,1,"This did not work for us; the citrus overpowered the red peppers completely. We love almost all citrus but not in this. This tasted like citrus marmelade with the peppers tossed in for bulk.
I'll stick to making my Red Pepper Jelly and my Marinated Roasted Red Peppers when we get a hankering for red peppers (capsicums)."
264017,326913,2009-02-07,5,"Mmmmm...all my favorite things (besides chocolate!) in one bowl! This is a colorful, healthy salad that serves well as a main dish for a light meal. I used whole wheat rotini and fat free mayo to skinny this up a bit. Plus, I had only 1 cup frozen peas, but it still seemed to fill out the salad nicely. I will enjoy this for school lunches along with some crackers and fruit. Thanks GrumpyChef! Made for Potluck Tag."
114021,10399,2006-04-21,5,"This is one of my favorite recipes.  I make it every week or two.  Quick, easy and great flavors."
226066,211307,2007-04-21,4,"This was a really different pasta dish.  Had a bit of trouble blending the flour in the chicken broth, but besides that little ""problem"", really enjoyed the pasta!!  Didn't have any fettuccine so used bow ties instead.  Loved the different veggies in this dish and the fact that there is no cheese involved (though I love cheese!!) - I didn't really miss it!!  I steamed my veggies in the microwave, one at a time, to save some time.  Thanks WI for a great pasta dish! :)"
58104,32201,2003-03-07,5,This I made for a party It`will be something if it gets there!It`s so good I did use lemon juice and red wine vinegar equaling 1/2 cup. And used 4 cloves roasted garlic and 3 cloves fresh garlic.This is really really good!!!!!!!!
2001038366,435610,2016-06-05,5,An annual must at my house! Gave up giving out plum jam at Christmas and give jars of this salsa instead!!
437991,413643,2010-03-06,4,"DH loved this but i thought it was not tense enough, not really like a pie. I am going to make this again but it needs some improvement somewhere, i am not sure. It is a great idea though! Good luck for the contest."
734479,141387,2008-11-22,5,"My boys ate it up! Didn't have ketchup but it turned out fine. Used corn starch instead of flour but I might stick with flour next time- mine wasn't super creamy. 16 oz was a LOT of hot dogs, might use a little less next time. Over all very tasty!"
465056,241860,2007-09-20,4,We used this as a side dish and we liked the flavors.  I was out of black olives so I omitted them.  I would suggest though browning the onions a bit before adding the rice.  The onions were not quite done enough by the time the rice had browned.  Add some garlic and double the cheese and this would be a 5 star recipe.
186802,31010,2006-05-09,5,"This was so easy!  I had some chicken I had cooked over the weekend.  I knew the first part of the week was going to be busy, and this dish was perfect.  Not alot of time spent making it, but a great time enjoying it!  The only thing I did different was serve the rice on the side and used frozen stir-fry vegies, instead of peas.  Thank you for the great recipe!"
844554,124105,2009-03-24,5,"We Loved It!! Even though it didn't taste exactly like mom's (what recipe does?) , this was wonderful. I cut the recipe in half since I only had 2 small kohlrabi but otherwise followed exactly. Will make again and again. Thank you for posting this!"
422893,313333,2009-09-23,4,What a lovely way to jazz up plain old weetbix. I made this minus the sultanas for a satisfying brekky treat. Thanks for posting!
354140,100408,2011-06-08,5,"Wow, very tasty. Took some ideas from others, made 3lbs ground turkey, 1lb ground pork. Didn't have fennel seeds, but since it's the locorice flavor we want, I substituted with anise extract, I also had star anise which would have also worked. Didn't have thyme either so omitted and it still turned out awesome.I like sausage on the sweet side so added 1 tspoon of brown sugar and 3 teaspoons of maple syrup, which I like on sausage and strangely not on pancakes."
161938,33995,2009-10-05,5,"these are absolutely amazing!  i like to cover them in chocolate and white chocolate and let them solidify in little glassine candy cups.  (makes them look fancy)  i used to freeze the truffles to make them easier to dip in the chocolate, but it apparently makes the truffle concoction contract. and then when they come back to room temperature, the filling will ooze out of any holes or thin areas of the coating. oops!  hehe.

i must have made these 5 times already, and they're always perfect!"
383346,304281,2008-07-14,5,"I made the recipe as stated.  And I loved it.  Would do it again for sure.  It's beautiful, full of colors.  Thanks Lainey.  Made for Newest Zaar Tag."
478451,259573,2010-04-24,5,"This works perfectly.  I always had chunks missing from my eggs when I tried peeling them in the past and the vinegar in the water really works.  I went out after the eggs came to a boil, so they cooled in the pot by the time I returned.  The important part was they peeled perfectly.  Thanks for posting the technique."

131674,190101,2008-07-10,5,My boys loved this.  I used two cans of buttermilk biscuits cut in half and layered them into a bundt cake pan.  I probably only refrigerated this 4 hours but it baked up fine.  Crusty outside and buttery inside.  I only used 1 cup of melted butter but the exact amount of herbs.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Zingo ZWT4.
56112,98446,2005-07-30,5,"I didn't have any fresh peaches, but used peaches that I had frozen.  It still worked fine.  Great pie.  Thanks for the recipe.

1795748,89204,2011-10-23,4,"Super Easy!  Family Rating = 4; high carbohydrates, so DH could not give it a 5 and DD did not care for the chicken, but loved the beans, corn, salsa and cream cheese.  Thanks for sharing, Jen Santiago!"

25017,38584,2002-10-23,5,"MMM waking up smells good with this cooking in the kitchen!  My family is up very early and off quickly, they loved this so much when my daughter got home from school she looked for the leftovers in the fridge.  I wouldn't change anything about this recipe.  Very, very delicious!"
14410,416689,2010-04-21,3,"This was not bad. It was easy to put together, and made just enough sauce for our supper. However, I think I need to add more seasoning next time. It wasn't very highly flavored."
1657616,60038,2013-02-04,5,Super easy to make! I took this to a family gathering and it was a hit!
695933,111372,2013-01-10,4,"One of the best recipes I've found on 'zaar -- and that's saying something! The roasts were all so small that I bought 2 (5# total), increasing most of the other ingredients by 50% so there would be plenty of juice."
445711,243845,2007-10-16,4,"Yummy comfort food!  Made this for lunch today.  I used pre-cooked packaged turkey, instant mashed potatoes and made the gravy from a packet.  I will make this again with Thanksgiving leftovers and I know it will be much better with ""fresh"" cooked turkey, real mashed potatoes and gravy.  I might use a nice slice of sourdough bread then too (which we have at Thanksgiving).  This was good even with the packaged stuff though."
1701315,443969,2011-04-11,5,This was a very good and easy cake.  I think next time I will add some vanilla to the batter!
89831,111104,2005-07-30,5,"What a fantastic salad! I prepared the nuts a day in advance, and I was lucky to have any left for the salad, they are so good! I also made the dressing a day also. I used feta instead of blue cheese, served this with romaine lettuce. DH gave this ""two thumbs up"" we loved this liz, I can't wait to make this again, thanks for sharing such a great recipe!...Kitten:)"
268501,125736,2009-09-18,5,"Excellent.  This will go into the rotation.  Next time, more jalapeno, however.  And we added a handful of fresh Thai basil leaves.  Also, we did this in the wok, but your suggestion of a dutch or other wide bottomed pan would have been better.  We'll go with that the next time.  Thanks."
222433,87860,2006-03-11,5,Very good recipe! Made it exactly as posted. My family will definitely be having this again! Thanks shimmerchk!
2001187526,505641,2016-09-29,5,"I split my batch and put some up without a canning bath and some with. The unprocessed were so good. The canning bath cooked the pepperoncini, removing their wonderful crispness. I won't do that twice unless there's a way to hot water can without cooking the product."
40152,47326,2006-10-22,5,"I used heaping tsps. of both cinnamon and nutmeg and will increase it even more on my next baking of this cake. 
I baked mine in a glass pyrex dish for 44 minutes. I think that may have been  a tad too long as it could have been a bit more ""gooey"". I cut the sugar to l l/2 cups which was adequate especially as I served it with ice cream. I used icing sugar which is how it is labelled in Canada.
8 tbspns. of melted butter is l/2 cup making a total of 1 cup for the whole recipe. 
I wasn't sure what to expect but it turned out much like a cheescake with a separate crust. I was confused about the pouring instructions for the cake as it  had to be pressed into the pan not poured. 
Very delicious and I will make it again. Very rich and can be cut into more than 10 pieces.  "
103876,27670,2004-09-08,5,"This was very good.  I used 1 can of tuna, 1 tblsp. liquid smoke, 1 tblsp. Mrs. Dash and about 2 tblsp. of light mayo.  This is an excellent way to get a good dose of protein and is easy to make."
120121,99023,2005-07-14,5,Great sauce!  We loved it.
51641,75996,2004-02-15,5,"Hello Ducky,
I have traveled throughout Thailand and have never had this popular recipe. Also, since I love Singapore Curry Rice Noodles, I could not wait to try your recipe.
It was very, very good! I substituted some ingredients and used what I had on hand. For example used egg noodles, garlic & chili paste, less sugar... and alpha sprouts...etc. I plan on making this recipe again (today, second time) because it was so, so good! Thanks for sharing.
"
295018,38584,2008-02-01,5,"I've been doing this for years! My children and I love it. The only things I do differnetly is to spray my crockpot with vegetable cooking spray for an easy clean-up, add a PINCH of salt to slow down the cooking of the oats (so they don't turn too,too creamy. personal prefference) and I mix in the cinnamon when I get up in the morning. Also,my children really like when I add 1 cup of apple sauce and 1 cup of brown sugar with the cinnamon and serve it with a good helping of cream in their bowls.(so do I!)This is a ""winner"" recipe in our house! OH!, If you think it is too mushy try reducing the water to 4 cups and add 2 cups of ice to the VERY cold water. I've done this and it does work for me."
266635,67570,2011-06-22,4,"This recipe was very good.  I used two eggplants instead of the one and adjusted the rest of the ingredients accordingly.  I may have used too much lemon as the consistency was a little loose, but still tasted fine to me.  I ran everything through the food processor as I like this dish smooth.  Served it with organic blue corn chips. Thanks for the post!"
128473,360559,2011-02-21,5,"I really loved this recipe, it was so easy and it tasted great.  It was ready when I was. I added homemade vanilla that had seeds in it...so good in this.  The cream was perfection, really enjoyed the thickness, creaminess and flavor.  It was so silky, just perfect in my strawberry parfaits.  I garnished with a vanilla bean and coarse sugar combo.  Thank you so much for sharing a new favorite."
737935,27208,2014-12-20,5,One word sums this one up---DELISH!  This is recipe is a keeper!
222478,11727,2006-10-03,5,Fantastic recipe Evie! I used the same quantities over two steaks and then poured the rest of the sauce over vegetables and it was great. I didn't have any brandy so used a tablespoon of whiskey mustard instead of the the Dijon and brandy.
2110244,56201,2013-10-23,5,"Excellent! I only used one can of tomatoes , added extra garlic, a bit of cumin and one thai chili for extra heat. Reminds me of Wendy&#039;s chili.Easy and so quick"
47892,234388,2011-12-03,5,"These are the perfect choice for a bake sale at church on St. Nicholas Day!  My notes: The cookies spread large when baked (in other words, allow plenty of room on the cookie sheet for them to spread) and they are very delicate. Wait at least 10-15 minutes after removing cookies from the oven before transferring to a wire rack. I used a KitchenAid stand up mixer to prep. A light sprinkle of dyed red sugar was added for the final touch. The cookies will crisp up once cooled. I was hesitant to bake the cookies at 400 degrees but they turned out perfectly and didn't burn! Butter should be at room temperature, better to use freshly grated nutmeg,  nuts (a combination of odds and ends: hazelnuts, almonds, walnuts and pecans) were finely chopped using the PULSE setting on the food processor. Very easy to make! Thanks for posting!"
36949,64465,2004-10-18,5,"awesome dish! there were only two of us, so we enjoyed the left overs for days. we also used flour tortilas for soft tacos. the bean mixture is more spicy as left overs as the salsa as been able to sit. very enjoyable, thanks."
496803,65956,2008-03-29,5,"This was amazingly good.  The kick it gets from the pepper flakes is a wonderful contrast to the creaminess of the sauce.  I used canned tomatoes as well, since it's only March, and good fresh tomatoes are still months away, but I didn't drain them.  I used the suggestion of the reviwer who said they'd cook it longer with the canned tomatoes, adding another 10 minutes in step 5.  They were much softer then, but still fairly chunky, so I used my immersion blender to get the texture that we like.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon each of dried basil and oregano in place of the parsley, but put it in when I gave the tomatoes another 10 minutes.  As a last addition, I topped the pasta with sliced chicken breast to add a bit of protien to our meal.  I will definately be using this one again!"
464080,14696,2008-04-20,4,"The ratings for the 4 of us were: 3,4,5,4 so I am giving it a 4.  Meat was fork tender to say the least.  I will add more salt and garlic next time.  Served over brown rice which was very good with the sauce."
248420,88625,2005-11-07,5,This was excellent.  I used vanilla pudding because that was all I had on hand.  It turned out very moist and delicious.  Simple yet elegant.
92886,65840,2005-03-07,5,"I thought this was just about perfect.  It was the perfect amount of sauce, the flavors clean and it was rich without overdoing it.  I had to hurry up and wrap up the left overs before I finished up the whole dish."
318235,240610,2010-05-15,5,"Wow! This was a fabulous and easy recipe! For the sauce, I didn't remove the broth from the pan, just added the shallots and butter to it. I needed a bit more liquid so I added some water and a little heavy cream. It was so wonderful. I served over rice with a side of green beans. This one is going into my favorites cookbook!"
1396309,133624,2012-07-10,3,"I made this with veggie spiral pasta and doubled the recipe. It was ok, something I would have to add some stuff to make it better. I think it really does need the celery, but I wanted to try the recipe as written first. Maybe it just had a funny flavor because of the veggie pasta?? It wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst. The cheese really is needed and adds a good flavor."
2909897,360742,2013-07-20,0,Too disgusting for words. They are so horrible and should come with a warning
817200,91644,2008-12-17,5,"This cake is SO good and SO easy...not to mention- impossible to mess up! I have already made it twice and plan on making it for my xmas office party. You really cannot go wrong! 
Does anyone know what the recipe would be if I used a 13 X 9 cake pan? I am really bad at estimating!!! Thanks"
118268,355420,2011-01-08,4,"I was looking for something to use up the pumpkin butter and found this.  They are pretty good, although quite sweet.  I will make them again though.  thanks for sharing!"
389683,283356,2011-05-31,4,This was a hit at our house!  We had it with fresh tortillas and it was a tasty dinner.  I also used Rotel tomatoes and green chilis and it had plenty of punch.
117207,73020,2004-02-17,5,This is the best soup I have ever made! Great recipe! I will be lightening it up next time to cut the fat. But it is dreamy as written.

Thank you for such a great pot pie recipe!!!"
621955,38510,2007-12-22,5,I used this recipe this year (2007) & they were FANTASTIC!!!!
35193,15296,2002-10-23,5,This is wonderful and easy!  My husband and I 'tag team'.  I do the indoor prep and he grills them.  Great recipe for company!
1139501,203854,2012-01-17,5,Like Marg I really liked the coconut! I even cut the grapefruit in four and put coconut all around it!
47559,428116,2013-08-03,4,"We really liked the creamy dill flavor in these eggs.  It was such a quick and easy recipe, too.  Next time I will reduce the amount of cream cheese, but that&#039;s just personal taste.  Made for Mike and the Appliance Killers ZWT 9."
12536578,5170,2014-07-27,5,I have tried just about every method to try and get the perfect pancake.  This one takes the cake (or pancake :)).  The texture and taste were delicious.  I cleaned out all of my other pancake recipes and made this one my one and only. Yummy!
424680,403995,2010-01-19,5,"We love Brussels sprouts around here, & although I often fix them somewhat plain, this recipe really dresses them up nicely & the mustardy flavor is very satisfying! Definitely a recipe I'll keep around! [Made & reviewed in 1-2-3 Hit Wonders tag]"

330505,183967,2008-07-27,4,Made these and took them to church for refreshment time.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks for posting! Made for I Recommend Tag Game.
63098,110016,2012-03-29,5,Have not tried this as I am way past college age. but this did make me smile
37636,103643,2008-05-01,5,"I loved this recipe! The addition of caraway was the perfect touch. I used currants in mine, and had bought them at Trader Joe's and they were more plump and tasty than other currants I have bought at the grocery store. I think they made this recipe go over the top as well. Wonderful with Irish butter! Thanks for sharing. ~Sue"
316094,79093,2007-02-02,5,"These are really good. I used peach protein powder since that's what I had in the cupboard, replaced about half of the water with agave syrup (I wanted it a little sweeter) and used one whole egg instead of 2 whites. These bars aren't as dry and sawdusty as other recipes I've tried that call for protein powder. The best part is one bar is enough to get you through the entire morning. I'll be eating these for breakfast from now on!"
184986,80467,2005-05-16,5,These meatballs are great.  The best sauce.  I also make smaller meatballs for appetizers. I have also used grape jelly and it tastes just as good.
67728,474060,2014-05-01,5,"Made this for breakfast this morning -- perfect! I love how simple it is to toss together, and it gives me time to pop it in the oven and feed all the critters while it&#039;s baking up. Made the kitchen smell lovely, too! I agree with loof, it&#039;s nice that this recipe cooks up more like stovetop oatmeal than most baked oatmeals. Now I&#039;d like to try this with some other fruits, too. Thanks for the wonderful breakfast! Made for PAC Spring 2014"
1803351886,62130,2016-08-29,5,"Easy, tasty, fluffy little cookies I didn't have almond extract so I added a little orange extract along with the vanilla. I would take these to Christmas parties."
402559,53704,2007-11-16,5,Hubby literally had to pry the pie plate away from my daughter and me and we both had little girl fits when he did. This is one of the best pies I have had. I didn't use the crust and didn't miss it and I did use egg beaters for the eggs. Also I threw the pecans in the blender because they don't like whole nuts for some reason but will eat them when they are finely chopped. Weirdo's. The pie separates like a regular pecan pie except you have a dreamy custard bottom layer with the traditional crunchy pecan top layer. It's the best of two worlds and I will be making this again and again. Thanks so much!
37449,41737,2002-12-05,5,We all loved this! But I must admit I did make an addition. I added about a 1/2 a can of cream of celery soup. I feel bad that I didn't make it exactly like the directions said. I don't know what came over me! But it did turn out soooooooo good!!! Thanks!;]
157425,143761,2008-03-25,4,We liked these potatoes and they are very easy to make in the electric skillet. I used russet potatoes and was out of minced onion so I used onion powder and skim milk. After 45 minutes my potatoes werent browning so I turned the skillet up to 300 for a few minutes. Added the cheese and italian breadcrumbs but forgot to add the parsley. Simmered for an additional 20 minutes and they were perfect. Served Andy Wold's Recipe #71459 with the potatoes and had a very nice meal.
621626,232073,2009-07-15,4,I don't like messing with seafood too much so I used the small shrimp used in salads. I did cut the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp because mine is very strong. Made for Newest Zaar Tag
1802568906,31314,2014-03-10,5,"I made this for the first time tonight, and it was so good!!  The only I changed was that I used 2 lbs of ground beef, and doubled up the bread crumbs.  We eat a lot at our house, so I didn&#039;t think 1 lb of ground beef would be enough :)   It was a HUGE hit at our house, and I will definitely be adding this to my list of frequent dinner recipes!!"

1803591456,73362,2014-12-31,0,Made these tonight in slow cooker. They are delicious! Easy to make too. I added just a pinch of cayenne pepper to give them a bit of &#039;zip&#039; .

243616,22841,2005-09-19,4,"We boiled them for 30 minutes, but they need an hour I'd suggest. Everyone raved about them. We had over 8 pounds of ribs for a dozen people and adjusted the recipe accordingly. Very good!"
53378,37784,2003-02-01,5,I love bean salad and this one was exceptional. I packed it for my lunch since I am the only one who likes it in my family (too bad for them). A wonderful mix of ingredients that all combined well for a zesty flavor. Thanks for sharing this.
160974,316028,2010-01-31,5,"I love using my pressure cooker and this recipe is a perfect reason why. I used white wine for the sherry and garlic jalapeno stuffed olives. I was impressed that the breading on the chicken stayed perfectly intact after cooker! I served over a wild rice blend and with a side a peas. THANKS for telling the book's author! I just ordered myself a copy.

583780,33201,2007-09-09,4,"This is a great 'base' recipe but I tweaked it a lot. 
First, no need for cooking spray. One light brushing of the baking sheet does the trick. Olive oil has so much goodness in it!Definitely less breadcrumbs - 60g was plenty.  Instead of 4 egg whites, I just used two eggs beaten with 1 tbsp of milk (why waste the yolks?) and made my own very easy sauce with passata, garlic, onions, crushed chillies and 400g of extra lean ground turkey to boost the protein content. Top layer of mozzarella can use a spoon of parmesan mixed into it, and only FRESH basil!! Makes such a difference. The dish came out spectacular - and only about 100 cal per 100 g. Yum!
Oh yeah, black pepper is a must."
66008,18651,2004-02-22,5,This was scrumptuous! I cooked a whole chicken cut up in this sauce (doubling the sauce.) We ate some of the pieces with the spinach salad #26701. The rest I deboned (no problem it fell off the bone!) and left the meat in the sauce. We will eat it later this week over potatoes or rice and with creamed peas. This recipe is a keeper.
444132,135619,2011-05-15,5,"Wonderful, Rita, I loved this simple and delicious recipe!  I made this a couple of months ago and forgot to review it - life got in the way!

Thanks, Rita - made for Veggie Swap."

173399,60548,2005-03-30,5,"This is how I make tuna and I love the spicy curry flavor.  Some suggestions- instead of chopping up an onion or using onion salt, I use 1 Tbsp dried minced onion.  I also go heavy on the curry powder and omit the salt. I also like this with 1/4 c gren peas mixed in for color."
917193,117211,2009-01-11,5,"I loved this, and I think it has to be much more healthy than instant oatmeal. I had wondered what everyone meant by a ""different texture"" and it really is a great texture - not soft, mushy or gooey, but kind of firm & chewy.  I made it exactly as the recipe said and it was not too sweet, nor did it need any more sugar. Perfect! Thank you for the recipe!"
735704,67570,2011-09-25,5,"Yes - this is pretty much a perfect baba ganoush recipe.  I do use my food processor to smooth it out, but other than that I make this just as written.  Very good.  Oh, and I sprinkle a little smoked paprika on top for serving.  Thanks for posting."
268222,62639,2005-12-15,5,A definite must try. One of the better chili recipes i have tried. Very good. I think the bacon really set it off.
129958,222219,2008-11-15,5,"What a delicious recipe!  I used chicken tenders as I keep these on hand and prepared the sauce as directed.  It was raining today, so I used my grill pan and it worked perfectly.  The bacon was done and the chicken was amazingly tender and moist.  I loved the flavor of the basting sauce.  This would be easy to adapt to bite size pieces  and use as appetizers.  Prepared in participation of My 3 Chefs.  Thanks lizbits!"
866298,10727,2008-07-31,4,"This cake was very good. My sister thought the cake was to dense and heavy, but the rest of us thought it was soft and moist one complaint out of 5 adults and 3 kids is good in my book! everyone else loved it. I did use 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda and while folding in the raspberries i had the great idea of tossing in some chocolate kisses scince they were right next to me! it was a great addition to the raspberries in the cake. Thanks for sharing this one."
1690323,127872,2010-09-23,5,"GREAT dip! I have made it several times following the recipe exactly. It tastes great on all kinds of raw veggies, especially broccoli. Any time my friends come over, they request this dip."

Just be sure you use the right kind of cheese because I originally used a quesadilla melting cheese, which melt it did not........I hade a mixture of cream and chilies with solid clumps of melting cheese.  They need to re-think their labels....  Anyways, I used the right cheese and it works like a dream.  Thanks so much!!"

Wont make my potatoes any other way.

In one batch I forgot the butter and they still tasted great! My room mates couldn't guess what ingredient was missing. (One guessed vanilla. And she's a cook. They really had no idea.)<br/><br/>PS Yes, definitely use fresh cranberries, not dried. Think of blueberry muffins, it will turn out like that.

P.S: Stars to follow........but it looks 5 star to me!! 28th September 2008: I have finally made this!This was SUBLIME Annacia! I have a lovage and lavender chicken recipe which is similar, but this had a GORGEOUS marinade which gets basted over the chicken as it cooks! I served this decorated with a fresh bunch of herbs and lavender, and the glaze from all the honey was wonderful. Taste - WOW! This was tender and NOT too dry - again due to the marinade. I am thrilled that you thought of me when you found this recipe and posted it - It has become a keeper for me, and I will always think of you when I cook this. Oh yes, I served this with gently steamed seasonal vegetables and baby potatoes - the marinade that was in the tin, I skimmed the fat off and added a good slug of wine, heated it through and served it as a gravy. Merci! FT :-)"
356738,60404,2006-09-26,4,"Delicious! Though macaroni took a lot of water from the soup, I kept adding more still it was very tasty!!! I used regular navy beans in a can, and still it tasted good! Thanks for the recipe!"
58837,73469,2003-10-30,5,"Excellent, wonderful flavor and texture. I used fresh apple cider."
218535,91598,2008-09-22,5,This is so good that even my picky 2-year old will eat it. A keeper.
2001638306,470501,2017-07-22,0,Did anyone Use all coconut flour no almond flour at all?.
2001742758,7006,2017-10-07,5,Great recipe. I used a ranch packet instead of onion soup. It turned out delicious. My family ate two helpings. The buttermilk made the whole thing
2324285,80629,2013-04-01,5,"I really liked these!  They&#039;re light but still flavorful, and are very easy to make.  I&#039;ll be making these often- thanks for sharing."
2709230,495291,2013-02-24,5,This recipe its easy to make and tastes very good.
429217,325674,2009-10-04,5,"I had a lot of fun making this!  I am fresh out of chips, walnuts and baking cocoa, but I used dark drinking chocolate and added Penzey's cinnamon.  I put the ingredients in a tall latte mug and it took exactly 3 minutes.  You're right, even without the chips it has a lot of chocolate flavor.  A perfect quick dessert.  I can't wait to make this with my niece & nephew."
298106,107968,2010-02-14,5,"Wonderful recipe!!  I took your advice and cut the seasonings in half and left the salt out completely, and this turned out perfect!  Baked it in a toaster oven for a total of 30 min, flipping halfway through.  Thank you for posting this, it's a keeper!  :)"
203741,60435,2007-03-27,4,"I am so glad I made these last night in preparation for breakfast this morning!  The only changes I made were more poppy seeds as I LOVE poppy seeds & 3 Tsp is just not enough. And instead of muffins, I made 4 mini loaves in my Pampered Chef mini loaves pan. The baking time obviously took a little longer but they turned out great. Thanks for a great recipe! Oh and I am pretty sure that my Vanilla StonyField Yogurt made the difference for me  :)"
128526,133624,2006-01-10,5,"This is a great recipe - the instructions are easy to follow, it simple to make & tastes great!! What more could you want from a recipe. It also reheats beautifully.  We served it with a spinach salad, its a great filling meal. I'm going to submit this recipe into my DH's triathlon club newsletter - Thanks Beck D - from Annetty (& the Triathletes)  ;)"
1800886149,215414,2013-12-16,5,"Turned out very tasty, though I had to sub cream of mushroom for cream of chicken. It was a hit. :)"
37449,276421,2012-10-19,5,"Well mine turned out lovely to look at and tasted good too.  I halved the recipe and used larger 6"" ramekins to make two. Thanks! Made for Newest Zaar tag."
726534,7556,2013-05-09,3,"This pie was absolutely delicious, but I made the mistake of cutting the strawberries into big slices rather than leave them whole, and it came out like soup.  (Maybe my strawberries were extra juicy......I don&#039;t know.)  In any case, it tasted delicious with whipped cream on top.  By the way, the food coloring is totally not needed.  Mine was perfectly red without it."
948500,44538,2008-09-08,5,"I added a couple of squares of unsweetened chocolate, 1 tbs. brown sugar, and blended the finished chili to the consistency of hotdog chili, as recommended by other cincinnati (skyline) chili recipes. DEEEELISH!!! Also, I put the crockpot on ""warm"" setting overnight and it was at a low simmer in the morning. PERFECT!"
89831,50951,2006-01-26,5,"YUMMMMY! I sauteed an onion and garlic firstly and added in some red pepper flakes for heat, also a can of undiluted tomato soup. Will serve it with rice. Thanks Marg!"
451042,150739,2007-02-27,4,A nice change to Italian style meat sauce. I did not have the red curry paste so I used red curry powder instead. The lime and curry really came out as my favorite flavors in the dish. I served it ontop of basmati rice and then mixed it all together in my bowl. Thank you Redsie!
2002248983,282620,2018-08-16,0,"Making tomorrow night. However, I'm going to first mash the potatoes and after cooking the ground beef, add onions, green pepper, a can of sweet corn and peas, sprinkle hints of garlic salt, lemon pepper and red pepper flakes. Did this once, not sure if a recipe out there for this, but I call it &quot;Garbage Dump&quot;."
1292017,316847,2010-07-11,0,"I have baked this pie to years in a row it is vert yummy. I added an extra cup of blueberries to make it really full. The only thing both times I have made it it is very soupy,last year I used flour this year I used cornstach, next time I am going to use minute tapioca. No matter what is was delicious. I also sprinkled a little sugar on the top of the crust. I will definetely make again."
1060667,1035,2017-07-08,5,"I think I waited a little to long to add my chocolate mixture to the chex because some of it clumped up and didn't want to coat the cereal. My fault though, and they tasted great!"
1818136,76237,2011-09-13,5,They were perfect. My DH and my DS just LOVE them. The only change I made was to add a little blue sugar.. I let my son choose the color. I made about 27 cookies. 350 for 8 minutes. <br/>Thank you!  I can't wait to try other flavors!
601528,42635,2009-09-29,5,These are so yummy!  I doubled the batch based on other reviews and used caramel bits in place of the butterscotch chips since I was out.  These are very versatile!  Chocolate chocolate chip would be really yummy too.
2001256668,22989,2016-11-20,5,Attaching recipe given to me years ago. The cookies come out soft and delicious!
329769,97523,2007-06-10,4,"*Reviewed for Zaar World Tour 3*
My daughters really liked these. We dipped the whole donut in butter and then covered in the sugar. Had the smell and consistency of a donut (I'm GF and so couldn't try any). Easy to amke and use ingredients that I always have in my pantry"
954555,204652,2008-11-01,5,"My goodness Brian you truely enjoy your curry!!! Where I live its hard to find good curry, so I have to make do with what ever I can find. Chutney is another product hard to find, infact i could'nt find it, but the receipe turned out good anyways. I AGREE with the rest ""WONDERFUL"""
65197,137695,2005-10-20,5,After I saw the pictures...I had to make them!!  We weren't disappointed!!  Very good!  Thanks for the great recipe!  I loved the spices!
58931,133563,2007-01-04,5,This recipe is outstanding.  It looks and tastes expensive; you'd never guess its humble ingredients.  I use vegetarian chicken flavored broth for a lovely vegan soup.  Thank you for posting.
18391,51828,2004-04-06,4,"This is a nice recipe .. I used 1T vinegar, and didn't change anything else .. my husband felt that it was missing something, but I liked it .. thanks for posting!"
647466,9240,2009-09-16,4,This was fast to make and tasty too.  Great for company!  Thanks Pear.
447123,125399,2007-04-17,5,GREAT STUFF. I must say this is just awesome. PERFECT for freezing for later. I didn't have texas toast style bread on hand so I used regular white bread. Definently would be better NOT to use white bread. White bread fell apart and was a bit difficult to work with. But the batter was GREAT. A super recipe. Again Thanks JillAZ!!!!!!!!!
403428,62368,2007-05-20,5,"Just took this to a get-together, and there wasn't a piece left. Very yummy."
768828,117194,2008-11-02,5,What an amazingly simple idea.  I had just eaten a plain apple when I read your recipe and just had to try it.  I also added  a little Splenda and next time I will dip in vanilla yogurt.  I may never eat a plain apple again.  You are a genius.
1118865,49836,2009-01-10,5,"Great but also easy recipe. Everyone loved these hash browns. They came out crispy and brown. I added a small amount of fresh rosemary and parsley. The rosemary makes them savory and the parsley adds freshness. Either way, great recipe. Feel free to add flavors you like. Thank you"
1622584,210757,2013-09-06,5,Love this soup! I usually mash the broccoli a little bit and I think that thickens it plenty. We usually eat it with french bread or some other type of crusty bread/roll and it&#039;s perfect. Just the right amount of spice but would be easy to add more if you like. This went into my regular meal rotation after the first time I made it - great warmed up too!
110125,56495,2010-01-11,0,"I think tuna and cottage cheese is a great combo, aside from being easy and healthy.  I like to add chopped celery or cucumber and lots of pepper."
943524,41721,2008-09-03,5,"I have tried many german style plum cakes, and this by far is the best. I even made it with peaches just as good."
383504,62254,2008-05-17,5,"Great recipe.  The texture was really good.  I'm not a huge banana fan, but my husband, kids and mom all loved this recipe.  They said I can stop looking, because this is it.  I doubled the recipe and used mini muffin tins, which gave me 72 mini muffins (3 pans total).  I sprayed the pan with cooking spray and had no problems with sticking.  Next time I'll try it with milk chocolate chips.  Thanks for the new family favorite banana recipe.  :)"
38257,146732,2008-01-28,5,My family loved this. I a few extra garlic cloves in it to compensate for the bland taste others had mentioned and i put to many. but other then that it was great. My husband didn't realize it wasn't all cheese. I used whole milk and a little dollap of sour cream. It was a huge hit with my 2 and 4 year old.
879475,203570,2008-07-03,4,We made this with soba noodles instead (1 8-oz pkg) and omitted the daikon (not a family favorite). It was delicious.
37868,15286,2006-12-08,5,I made this wonderful recipe for the Tamale class. Very Very good directions. The masa was easy to put together and the mixer helps more than anyone can know. Masa tasted great..the meat was wonderful. The masa spreaded very easy on the corn husk..meat was very easy to place. After the first 3 tamales I got the hang of the rolling. I did not use the ties as they had in the class. I placed them seamside down. I did use the crushed up foil in my pot for a make shift steamer and it worked out very good for me. My Brother now thinks this is the best Tamales...I have to rate this one with him!!! Thank You
195996,23225,2005-05-04,5,Yum!  I made these as pancakes.  I used honey instead of molasses.  Perfect for South Beach diet when topped with SF syrup.  Mmmm!
1639998,87925,2013-01-08,5,"every recipe I try from Kittencal turns out perfect!! my husband and son are amazed that I've learned to cook!:)  these brownies are simply amazing and soooo easy to make! I used milk chocolate chips and semi sweet but followed the recipe exactly as written--I used the 1 1/2 c of sugar. I love brownies with that little top crust!  my husband looked everywhere for the box and asked my son where I put it.(that's an amazing event). Kittencal, as long as you send in recipes I will surely try them, you are an amazing cook!!  I would give this recipes 25 stars if I could!!! one thing I'll not buy again is brownies from a box :)"
1426364,39087,2013-07-05,5,"GREAT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I also added green beans, a red pepper, and fresh tomato. Very tasty, and reduced the amount of cream to 250 ml, and only 1 breast, it was creamy enough for us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks so much for sharing."
107583,171002,2010-08-15,5,"Excellent marinade!  I did the tenderloin option, and placed them in a grill basket attachment on my rotisserie.  They cooked in about 20 minutes.  Used Jack Daniel's for the bourbon.  Nice combination of flavors.  I think this would be good on chicken thighs also, or boneless country spareribs.  Made for Grilling tag game at Kittencalskitchen.com."
115853,221953,2007-06-02,4,"The flavor is very good, though I agree with the other reviewer about the texture.  I baked this for more than 25 minutes and the top was brown, but they were still very soft in the middle and fell apart some when I took them out of the pan.  I almost think they could have stayed in a little longer, but I was afraid of burning them.  I didn't take them to the event I'd intended to because I wasn't sure they came out right and didn't have time to test them out before-hand, but I did snack on them at home and enjoyed them quite a bit!"
2001692846,481057,2017-08-29,5,This recipe was so simple and easy I did not use the cayenne pepper but I used sumac that give it the kind of tart taste oh so good. Thanks to my daughter Chermonthia Grant for sharing this.
586292,252521,2007-09-12,5,"These are the sugar cookies I've always wanted to find.  Easy to make.  Crispy on the bottom, chewy on top, lightly lemony throughout.  Mmmmm."
386585,322385,2009-08-24,4,"This is a nice change of pace from the typical beef-stew-style meals.  It seems to be the perfect blend of ingredients.  I was disappointed, though, that the onions really didn't carmelize as I had hoped, so it did not have quite the appearance of French Onion Soup.  It was still quite tasty, though!  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game."
1800038922,488965,2013-08-30,0,"This is the first time my biscuits didn&#039;t turn out like hockey pucks! Just a note, I used good old fashioned butter that I grated into the flour and not vegetable shortening.. Thanks for a great recipe!"
559630,39023,2008-09-11,5,"I totally love this recipe! I made it pretty much the same except without lemon and they were fantastic! My boyfriend totally loved them too. I fried them in olive oil instead of vegetable oil the first time I made them and added 3 cloves of minced fresh garlic to the bread crumb mixture. Today I made them with 2/3 cup of romano cheese, the 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs, and 1/3 cup of crushed up french fried onions and added a bit of garlic powder. They are a definite keeper for me, Thanks for the recipe!"
309526,201192,2012-12-07,4,"Very good! Easy to prepare, flexible and yummy. Thanks!"
1923497,53647,2011-06-02,5,"Made this for the ""ewww I don't eat crawdads"" people at the craw-fish boil. It got rave reviews!! Except I used collard greens instead of spinach..and offered smoked mushrooms on the side."
1150636,316408,2009-04-16,3,"This was a VERY salty recipe, I am a salt lover and this was to much for me :( it had a good flavor if you could get past the salt taste, I think maybe it was to much Adobo. I will try this again and cut the Adobo and chicken stock in half to see if that helps tune down the salt taste. Try using 2 tbs of Adobo and 2 cups broth with 2 cups water and I think you'll be happier."
196296,97573,2006-02-22,5,"Five stars all the way!  DH and I both thought this was one of the best curries we've ever had.  I changed only a couple of minor things - I didn't have ginger garlic paste, so I added a chopped clove of garlic and about a TBSP of chopped fresh ginger.  I added 2 TBSP of splenda to the sauce.  I also doubled all the spices, at the other reviewers suggestion.  I never needed to thicken the sauce, as it was lovely and thick, so I ommited the cornstarch and water part.  Anyway, it was lovely - served it over spinach.  Another bonus was that this takes very little effort!  "
159532,5418,2006-08-12,5,yummmmmmy...thanks so much
311625,113229,2009-09-28,4,"Very good. Used panko, basil, and oregano instead of the bread crumbs because of a food allergy. Kids all liked it too, and there were no leftovers! Thanks Pam!"
1580204,392930,2010-06-07,5,"This was good stuff!

I'd make one change, though.  Cook the fish halfway then add the sauce and cook the rest of the way, but that might be because I had a very hefty hunk of salmon."
18510,188768,2007-03-16,1,"Unfortunately, this was really horrible. It wasn't anywhere near  velvety - on the contrary, the texture was grainy and lumpy, and the flavor was just so-so. I had to toss the whole thing."
693345,216905,2009-09-18,5,"Great bread! I received some carrots from someone's garden, and I used them in this recipe. I doubled the recipe, using 1/2 c. oil and 1 c. applesauce (instead of 2 c. oil). I also used 5 eggs for the doubled recipe. I baked the bread in two 9x5 loaf pans at 350 degrees, and it was done in 50 minutes. I had only generously sprayed the pans with PAM, but next time I would line the bottoms with parchment paper, because the bottoms of both loaves stuck when I turned them out of the pans. This is the same recipe that I had found on the Mimi's Cafe website, and the taste is really close to theirs, I think. I wrapped one loaf up for the carrot-giver, and I hope she enjoys it as much as we do. Thanks for posting this recipe!"
126440,86067,2013-10-14,5,Great side salad to Recipe #507013.
461834,316028,2008-10-25,5,"This was so tasty, just loved it!!!  I made this as written, except used 3 very large chicken breast halves but kept the same amount for the sauce, as I was serving it over pasta and left out the olives.  I loved how it infused the flavor into the chicken.  Will definitely make again, but will probably sub boneless, skinless chicken breasts and decrease the cooking time.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe Kate.  Made for 123 tag."
519790,113299,2007-12-21,5,These are great! My dough was a little crumbly -I added too much flour. They were still absolutely delicious! They are so cute when you pop them out of the tin. I love that these are so easy and still a little bit special. A+ for any peanut butter  lovers out there.
1134426,30518,2009-01-18,5,"This was my first try at German potato salad and I though it was very good.  I did make minor alterations.  I used ""better than bullion"" from costso instread of bullion as that is what I had.  I did not add oil.  I also ate it the night I made it, so I only let it sit for an hour or so.  It was supper yummy!  I imagine the leftovers will be even better."
1135521,291602,2011-10-06,2,"not my cup of tea at all, which surprised me as I love all the ingredients separately.  So it wasn't a total toss out I doctored it to our tastes by adding a bit of sugar and balsamic and a generous sprinkling of ground peanuts."
142361,173004,2006-06-27,5,"I was really pleasantly surprised with this dish. The raisins, I admit, had me a bit skeptical but wow was I proven wrong! This rice was quite tasty and not super-sweet. A nice mix of flavors, very sensory-pleasing.
I subbed the butter for canola oil, but changed nothing else. Thanks for broadening my horizons! "
868673,329219,2008-11-25,5,"I used this sauce on my salmon, then grilled it.  When the fish was done I added some of the sauce on top and served. Delicious!"
254614,131880,2008-01-01,4,"I totally reversed the order of cooking this recipe.Because my huband cannot have hamburger and the rest of can. I sliced the carrots,cabbage and some onion in a stock pot along with 2 tblsps of oil. Tossed it around and added 1/2 cup water. Added the packet of flavoring from the ramen.Stir fried on medium to high heat, then add broken uncooked noodles with a cup and one half water and soy sauce. I cook the hamburger separately and add to each bowl served."
74281,188160,2008-09-23,5,"This really surprising combination of ingredients created a delicious salad for my granddaughter's 2nd Birthday party with a Mexican flair. I made mine in the food processor and everyone guessing what the ""nutty"" flavor was but because the pecans ground up so nicely even the people who claimed not to like nuts loved this salad!"
537937,422389,2010-09-06,5,"This recipe is fantastic and something I could eat every day.  Well...I do most days.  I used fresh raspberries just picked from the garden and my home-made granola.  Greek yogurt is something I normally don't keep on hand, but I do on occasion as it's much more filling than my normal Yoplait or Activia.  <br/>Made for KK's Big Fat Greek tag game."
329324,101104,2006-12-15,5,"Love it!!  I have never really made pies before and this turned out fantastic.  I made another recipe as well, and this one was the best!  It baked beautifully and had the spices were perfect.  I can't wait to make it again for christmas!"
496803,160441,2009-04-11,4,"I was a little skeptical at first, when I saw that there was no water in this recipe, and the cake was very dense.  However, the family just loved it, and every crumb was eaten.  The only change I made was to add add enough water to the glaze to make is liquid enough to drizzle, and I topped the cake with quartered strawberries.  This was a birthday cake for my dad, and he loved it.  Thanks for making his birthday a sucess!"
15851,40056,2002-11-03,3,"I made this yesterday and it wasn't bad.  When I make this again, I will cut back on the cracker crumbs. Instead of having a thick asparagus flavored sauce, I had cracker flavored asparagus.  I actually had to add water to it because it was TOO thick. Next time, I will probably have to cut up the asparagus into 1 inch pieces so they fit better in the crock. Also, I had to cook it in low instead of high, but that is probably a difference in crockpots.  I think this is a great base recipe that I just need to tweak to suit my personal tastes.  Thanks! "
2001658400,185498,2018-03-17,5,"Around here, we all loved this garlic bread. Thank you!"
323186,306013,2008-07-17,4,"Very nice, easy and good to eat.  I used frozen corn, didn't defrost it, it cooked easily in the 'sauce'.   I used a mix of grated cheddar and parmesan cheeses.
One thing,  there is onion in the directions, but not in the ingredients list!   IF I'd used onion, I would have lightly sauteed it before adding it,  just to soften,  but I didn't use it at all.
Another time, I might add mustard powder, I think it would complement the dish well.

Thanks for a nice recipe, weekend cooker!"
55578,13285,2006-08-16,5,This IS probably the best turkey burger ever!!! Def make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.
340141,116245,2006-09-05,4,"Fantastic flavor and DH really liked it.  However, I spread out the pizza dough so that it was 1/4-inch thick, and I couldn't seal the top over the filling.  It turned out more like a rustic, deep pie.  Still delicious, though.  I loved the creamy ricotta in it.  Next time, I will buy two tubes of pizza dough, split the filling between them and have two calzones.  "
473618,117211,2008-01-12,5,"This was really good and easy to make.  I too used quick cooking oats and baked it right away.  I think next time I may use cinnamon and nutmeg instead of just cinnamon.  Very easy for ""planned""overs."
268058,107544,2007-04-14,5,Loved it- made it for someone else and the reviews were great. I have posted a photo.
1136448,355021,2009-11-28,4,"This was my first attempt at making gravy or speghetti sauce from scratch.  It produced a much thicker sauce than any jar sauce out there.  The flavour was a little bland which I will correct next time with more garlic and fresh herbs.  This is just a personal taste and not necessarily a short coming of this recipe. The meatball reference were absolutely fantastic.  I've made some pretty poor meatballs in my time so I can tell you this was a definite success.
Go ahead all you non Italians and give this a shot.  You won't be disappointed."
2000061104,468751,2015-03-14,4,I substituted the butter for solid coconut oil (same amount) and it worked well. The crust was nice and flaky!
29022,3470,2014-06-10,5,I made this tonight and it was SO good.  The whole family loved it!
1810345,106430,2013-05-12,5,Fantastic. Cooked it for a bit over 40 min in a 9x13 pan in water bath. Smooth and creamy and perfect!  Remember to start with room temperature ingredients for the best results. It will disappear quick in my house
424680,403434,2010-03-04,5,"Although I suspect that the cream cheese & whipping cream were meant to be combined for a topping, I decided to change that a bit ~ Instead I allowed the 'jell-O' mixture in the refrigerator to almost set before I blended the cream cheese & whipping cream together AND THEN stirred that mixture into the jell-O, & we thought that worked out just great! Another time, I'll probably use a red jell-O, but as originally made, it was very satisfying! [Made & reviewed in Zar Chef Alphabet Soup tag]"
157425,371679,2012-08-05,5,"We enjoyed this shepherd's pie for dinner today and DH liked peas were in the pie. I did use beef (ground round) instead of the lamb, beef stock, what I had on hand, instead  of vegetable, added garlic to the onions, and DH sprinkled some shredded sharp cheddar over the top. Great comfort food! Made and Reviewed for ZWT8 - 2012 The Fearless Red Dragons."
58762,130108,2011-01-08,0,I made this exactly as written except I subbed onion flakes for raw onion...I liked the combo of lime and lemon a lot but felt it was missing something. I think next time I'll use a regular fresh onion and maybe some of the other reviewers' suggestions because this is a good base!
197023,96467,2005-09-10,5,"Because I made this soup for the âFreeze It!â Tag Game, I made a HUGE quantity.  I at least doubled the recipe: I ended up with 2 crockpots full, so I kind of lost sight of the ratio of the ingredients.  Both portion one and portion two â the frozen then thawed portion â were equally delicious.  Absolutely NO difference.  Very simply: the frozen portion I put into Tupperware Rock âN Serve containers, then when I wanted to use it, I allowed it to thaw at room temperature, and heated it in the microwave.  I must confess to having made a few changes to the recipe, a combination of what I had on hand, what needed to be used and personal preferences. The end result was fabulous. I used 6 cloves of garlic (instead of garlic powder), included all the juice from four cans of tomatoes, substituted 2 large eggplants (skin on) for the corn (Iâm not too keen on corn and I had some beautiful eggplants just past their peak that needed to be used immediately) and I added parsley, 2 cups of wine and a couple of drops of liquid smoke. Iâd only just tracked down the elusive liquid smoke and was keen to use it! Just as well I wasnât making cakes! The soup was absolutely delicious: very rich and everyone loved the combination of flavours. The cumin was a great ingredient! I love cumin in Middle Eastern dishes, but Iâve never thought to use it in soups before. As for the black beans: loved them, and I will be experimenting with using them in other dishes too. I used dried beans and Amanda Bethâs instructions gave me the confidence to cook them before putting them into the crockpot. The ones Iâd bought had NO instructions as to how to use them. Thank you Amanda Beth for a great recipe!

59780,116386,2005-02-16,5,"This was SO GOOD! The only change I made was to use only 2 breasts(one for the salad and 1 for the sandwich the next day for lunch)  instead of 4 because I am not a big meat eater. I chicken was so tender and the honey gave it a perfect touch of sweetness. I will be making this recipe again, thanks for posting!"
319738,149579,2006-08-08,5,Very good flavor that did not overwhelm the pork and wasn't too salty!  I had 4 very big chops and needed 3/4 of the recipe to fill the bowl and totally cover the chops.  I put dijon mustard on the chops and then covered with plain bread crumbs and pepper and baked them at 350 for about an hour.  Wonderful!
69838,39198,2004-05-30,5,"These are perfect chappatis.  Very wonderful texture, and lovely flavor.  Your directions are very easy to follow! Thank you SO much for helping me discover an easy recipe for these. I have made chappati for a while now, but none like this!  I plan to try incorporating wheat flour into these gradually ;) Thanks again for the recipe!!!"
280166,105747,2007-12-25,5,"Loved loved loved this dish - we ate it for our Christmas breakfast...just a few modifications for future reference...the steel oat pkg instructions used a ratio of 4 water : 1 oats.  After following the recipe instructions (ratio 4:2), I had to add alot more water, so I will use the 4:1 ratio in the future.  Some of my raisins and pecans burned while broiling, so next time I will sprinkle them first, then top with the brown sugar...oh yeah - this made closer to 8 servings for us....and I used MarieAlice suggestion and put a banana under the sugar mixture on 1/2 the pan.  My son stated it tasted like banana nut bread (his favorite).  Thanks for posting this new family favorite!"
425559,52999,2009-08-22,5,I added 1/3 C chopped up pecans and 1/3 C craisins to my batch. Best pancakes we've ever had!!! Topped them with homemade applesauce. Mmmmmm!!!!
489997,17181,2007-05-02,5,"I tried this recipe the other night for a date with my girlfriend who's one of the pickiest eaters I know. She loved it, and I loved it even more. I strongly recommend this one."
637887,202181,2012-02-03,5,Super great red potatoes! I quartered mine and used olive oil. Also added a fair amount of parsley flakes-I love the contrast of green on red.
235262,114948,2005-09-08,5,"I have made this recipe many, many times and it always turns out great. Sometimes I will use broccoli instead of aspargus just cause it can be cheaper and still works really well. Never any left of this dip."
1629391,2886,2010-06-07,0,This was my first time making banana bread and it is the bomb!!! it came out great!! thanx recipezaar!!!
225997,89486,2006-03-19,4,"This is a very traditional American meat-and-potatoes recipe. It is basically meatloaf that is repackaged with more veggies and is made more attractive. It is very easy to make, especially if you use frozen spinach. It is pretty good, and I may make it for my inlaws (they love meatloaf)."
1138643,256045,2010-03-01,4,"This was crazily, unexpectedly yummy!  I had my doubts.  I've never been a big fast food customer. But for all my gourmet type cooking and dining, when the chips are down and I am STRESSED... I NEED a Big Mac.  This totally fit the bill. I did make two slight changes.  I used rehydrated onions instead of fresh, since they don't seem fresh on the burger.  I also added some to the dressing.  I tossed in some roughly chopped hamburger dill slices into the salad as well to cover that part of the experience. Next time, I may reheat the bread too so it is warm in the salad."
239670,22181,2011-04-24,5,YUMMY! Thanks for the great recipe.  DELICIOUS!
1310060,298307,2009-06-29,5,This dish was WONDERFUL!! My family never stops bugging me about it. Every week they want me to make it. Its simple if you get all the prep done before you start cooking anything. I would recommend this to everyone.
190230,142029,2006-07-15,5,"Super yummy! Very easy and quick, and the perfect chewy cookie.  Thanks for a keeper!"
793586,330808,2009-01-13,4,"As with every recipe, I change for my own taste. I loved that this gave me an idea for a quick snack! I have adapted it with scrambled eggs, onions, and cheese for breakfast. The other day I made it with pesto, goat cheese, and sundried tomatoes! My guest LOVED them! I did sprinkle the pesto one with parm. cheese. I would DEFINITELY make these again. They are so EASY and look and taste impressive! Thanks!"
147026,21779,2008-04-22,0,I made these today and loved them. I read the reviews first so I ground up some stove top stuffing I had and tossed in about an 1/8 of a cup. I also used some speghetti sauce that had basil in it for the topping. They turned out really tasty. Thanks.
95728,439939,2013-07-06,5,"This is really delish!  I had no rolls for sloppy joe and thought this was a good way to go since I had the pie crust and needed to use it.  I didn&#039;t use the corn, but put green peppers in with the ground beef and onion.  Used swiss on the bottom and mexican blend on top (shredded).  Really REALLY good and easy!"
1052873,427604,2013-08-02,5,Very interesting blend of flavors and very tasty. I used canned beets and a huge apple so I think my ratio of beets to apples was off. I should have saved some beet juice to mix into the dressing to make it more pink and thinner. Made for ZWT9.
245866,114995,2005-11-01,5,"This pie is delicious and so simple to make, my best friend ate over a fourth of it!"
446143,115063,2007-09-22,5,"Yum!  Stuffed cabbage is such a pain the neck to make...this is quick, easy, filling and comforting.  I used lean ground turkey, added loads of garlic, and doubled the spices.  Thanks!"
553866,80153,2012-03-26,4,"I'm on the candida diet, and almonds are something I'm supposed to eat.  But I was getting really sick of plain almonds, so I tried roasting them.  This recipe definitely transformed a healthy-tasting food into a delectable food that just happens to be healthy.  Since I can't have sugar, I used 1/4 cup of Truvia instead.  I also increased the cinnamon to about 3 times the recommended amount, added a little ground ginger, and used vanilla in place of the water.<br/><br/>They turned out wonderful!  I wish I could have tried them with brown sugar, like some reviewers suggested, but that will have to wait for a later time.  They were still wonderful as they were.  Even my boyfriend loves these, and we agree they are a wonderful, healthy snack."
518302,8619,2009-06-30,0,This mac and cheese was really good! I didnt have as much cheese as i thought i did but it still turned great.! Thanks
632249,188261,2013-05-13,4,Yummy and South Beach friendly too! I used a lite feta cheese and added a sprinkle of basil. The next time I make it I will add a bit of garlic as I think it was just a bit bland.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
226066,47111,2009-10-21,5,Borrowed my dad's bread machine and had to try this as I love raisin bread... and we LOVED this recipe!!! Only problem I got was that there was more raisins at the bottom of my bread... but that was fine with us!! Thanks! :)
369621,63501,2006-11-19,1,These were very dry.  They didn't have any flavor.  I won't do them again.
68950,11345,2009-01-04,3,This wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  The tasted very oily.
323186,505456,2015-02-06,5,"Yum, this was delicious, Nancy!!   I was generous with all ingredients, particularly the cilantro (we call it dhania, or coriander),  which we love.   Easily prepared, I love this kind of dish,  I did use chicken breast fillets, cubed, but otherwise as directed.    Always great to have a meal that is bursting with flavour, on the table in no time at all.  Thank you for this one, Nancy, a keeper!!!"
92816,107544,2013-02-03,5,"This is the best cheesecake I have ever made,so creamy and the taste is amazing!I also added strawberry sauce to the batter to give it that swirl effect,it was ok but I think I like the plain cheesecake better.It makes a nice high cheesecake.Great tasting crust too.Excellent!"
2000770815,251103,2015-12-24,5,"Lovely recipe and very simple to make. Preparation tip - have a bowl of lemon infused water to place your apple slices as you do them to prevent browning this will also help preserve the chutney. Space it up a notch with a tsp or 2 of chilli flakes or powder. Brown sugar provides a rich dark coloured chutney.
This is excellent chutney after keeping a couple of months. Made this recipe twice now and will continue to use it !"
1801086265,501960,2014-06-16,0,"This is a great summer drink, all the flavors are perfectly balanced!  Thanks so much for sharing!"
58104,116450,2005-02-15,3,I think the chicken breast should have been browned stove top before going into the oven. The skin was just to mushy. Not appealing. I liked the idea of layering everything it gave it a nice presentation. The apricots was just to overpowering. I used 7 ounces of baby spinach and that was more then enough.
284904,250616,2009-10-03,5,"This cake is out of this world delicious.. I did not make it, a friend brought me some of her's and the recipe.. I could eat the whole cake..  texture is nice and moist.  Will make this today.. thanks a million for sharing"
439685,113519,2008-09-01,5,"Very easy to make, tastes great. Lots of flavor. Everyone in the family loved, which is almost impossible in our house."
84196,61946,2005-11-09,5,"Lovely, enjoyed by all. Only problem I had was the sauce curdling after a few minutes, still tasty but not very appetizing to look at.  "
133174,237011,2007-11-06,5,"This is really a great side dish.  I did add some garlic and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  Also, I topped it off with a sprinkling of crumbled goat cheese.  Definitely something to make again."
240552,35371,2008-03-11,5,"Delicious lunch! I used leftover chicken breasts, chopped and threw it in the pan along with fajita spices - chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin.  Thanks, Charlotte J!"
324612,221018,2008-03-20,5,"Fantastic recipe!  I have always been disappointed with my easter bun efforts in the past, but these were easy and yummy!  Only change I made was to double the fruit.  Thanks for sharing."
121185,95311,2005-10-26,5,These were SOOO good and SOOO easy!  I used my pasta maker and rolled them a little thick and cut them wide - they were perfect in our chicken soup! THanks!
1548909,76864,2010-02-23,5,"I followed the recipe exactly, they were lovely."
1319585,18947,2009-11-02,3,"This was very moist... to moist for my taste.  I though it was ok, however, one person at the party that I took this to raved about it and took all the left overs (which there were a lot of, so I am not sure if it was such a big hit)."
2000683185,393491,2015-11-16,5,"Great salsa.  We like it hot, so I wound up adding chipotle powder (smoked jalapeno) and some extra cumin after tasting the original recipe.  My green tomatoes were slightly yellow in color, so the final salsa came out more beige than green in color, but it tastes great.  Reminds me of a tomatillo salsa in flavor.  Definitely will make again."
416985,13279,2011-05-12,5,"This was very good. I used canned chicken, but followed the recipe otherwise. DH really enjoyed this. Thanks so much! Made for BB Tag,2011."
131126,418739,2010-04-30,5,"This is always a hit and pairs well with most fresh fruits from apples, bananas, berries, to nectarines. Suble changes can be made by adding vanilla extract, almond extract, or even cinammon. It is super easy to make & no one ever guesses the two ingredients. Thank you for sharing a standby recipe!"
38643,103247,2005-03-20,4,"We didn't seem to enjoy these as much as everyone else. With the exception of using ""light"" cream cheese I followed the directions exactly as written. I also had to add a little extra water twice as the potatoes started burning. "
242250,28148,2006-11-12,5,"Excellent recipe!!  Went together quickly and easily.  I added about 1/4 cup of monterey jack pepper cheese in with the cheddar. Prepared a side dish of spanish rice (#37638).
Will be making again soon!!"
58104,65160,2003-07-31,4,"So much flavor my mouth was alive!I would cut down on the 5 spice.
I used real crab skipped the arugula. Just use all the dressing because the leftover dressing started to I guess you would say ferment(bubble)!"
2000089409,147796,2015-03-27,5,Awesome. And easy to follow thank you it was great used red velvet brownie mix
2001641525,63071,2017-07-24,4,"This is a very good basic recipe .. If it did not work out for you...you did something wrong ! I tweaked it by doing this : Use Brown Sugar : 2 tps of vanilla : 3/4 cup sugar 1 tbs water. DIY pearl sugar : Add the sugar and water to a small pot. Turn the pot on over the lowest heat setting possible and stir with a wooden spoon until small clumps of sugar form. Your goal is to clump as much sugar together as possible (minimizing the amount of loose sugar) while not creating any overly large clumps. If there seems to be too much loose sugar and not enough clumps, add 1/2 teaspoon of water and stir again. Having been to Belgium with my Father who is from there .. This is hard to beat ! Cook Time 4 min."
109404,17213,2005-10-06,5,These were great!!  Super easy to throw together w/ a wonderful flavor!  I cut the meat to 2 lbs & only used 1 pkg onion soup mix.  I thought 40 minutes was enough simmer time.  These were served on wheat buns.  
685530,324210,2008-12-15,5,This was a hit! It was easy to make and I'll definitely be serving it again as an end to a comfort food meal. Thanks for sharing!
137619,54872,2005-03-12,4,I baked it at 335 for almost an hour and it seemed right.  Easy & delicious!  The layers got tough though and was hard to cut through but other than that it was great.  
226863,339367,2009-09-30,5,"Really yummy.  I used Roasted Garlic Ciabatta and it was wonderful!  My chives looked kind of wilty, so I used sliced green onions.  I really enjoyed this treat. Thanks for posting Boomie!  Made for 123 Hits Tag."
1779613,257766,2010-12-30,4,These were very good. I would just add a little more garlic and a bit more cheese. Made this for my wife as part of a surprise dinner and she loved it!
2467031,160432,2012-10-25,0,"I just tried this sandwich for the first time, love it!  We tried Shoppers Food Warehouse plain white bread, Skippy natural creamy peanut butter and both Clausen Kosher dill slices and someones bread and butter pickles, I can't remember whose.  I'm looking for a pickle right in the middle, b&b was too subtle, dill a smidge too strong.  What's right in the middle anybody?  Fantastic sandwich!"
564101,151955,2010-11-12,5,"Amazing!  We managed to get our oil too hot and burn the first two so we switched oil, cooled the pan, and improvised.  We fried until almost done then out of the oil, onto a cookie sheet, and into the oven for a bit.  They still had that fried taste without the greasy texture.  Very fabulous, thanks!!"
1690289,32844,2010-09-23,5,"Love this recipe! It's easy and delicious. It is very easy to change ingredient amounts depending on what you have on hand.....add diced celery.....very, very, yummy."
222064,102597,2007-09-01,4,"Very good.  Hubby and I really like it, kids thought it was OK."
424680,287779,2009-07-17,5,"My son was able to locate spaetzle noodles for me, whether at Trader Joes or some other speciality store near where he was house painting, so I was able to make this recipe just as written ~ They were a very nice change from the noodles we usually have! Thanks for opening us to a great new eating experience! Will certainly be making this one again! [Tagged, made & reviewed in the current Comfort Cafe as part of my theme ""This Little Piggy...""]"
1186940,117211,2010-02-13,5,This is it.  The perfect baked oatmeal recipe. I'll never search for another one again! Thanks!
685472,107786,2009-09-30,5,These ribs were awesome and SUPER easy.  I had never made ribs before b/c I thought it would be complicated but these are so easy.  I'm going to make them again and again.
229850,259459,2007-12-30,5,Was looking for a way to use up leftover ham from Christmas Kittencal and stumbled upon this recipe. It was wonderful ! We loved it !! I did use the half cream and half milk and added a little extra parmesan cheese to the top. Like a fantastic mac and cheese with a ham suprise ! Love your recipes girl !
2001324978,229697,2016-12-28,0,"I'd love to make this sauce,sounds very creamy and would taste bit like a stroganoff??just a question does it have bay leaves in it and how many??Also can I leave it out if it does??Thanks in advance Suzie :)"
537188,218803,2008-04-21,3,"In itself the recipe was very easy to follow...but I wasn't very keen on the cinnamon taste, even though I usually really like it."
2084664,52900,2011-12-09,0,Excellent Italian cookie. Everyone just loves these. I will make them for ever...
487548,148942,2007-05-12,3,Sorry but I didn't find this that good.  I used the dry mustard option because of the high sodium content of packaged onion soup mix.  I also added some onion powder.  The taste of the sauce was quite good but I found that the hen was done in 6 hrs and the breast at that point was already drying out.
2000091242,135297,2018-05-30,4,"This was a very nice dish. I used bone in, skin on thighs because that's what I had. I browned on each side for about 5 minutes each and then followed the recipe, but finished in a 375 degree oven for 30 minutes. I really enjoyed the salty, briny flavors of this dish that the olives and capers impart. I served over rice in this instance, but I think orzo would be a better accompaniment."
222139,99333,2006-06-27,5,Great muffins!  We liked these alot.  We will be making them again for us.  The only thing I did not use was the lemon.
1499202,130199,2009-12-26,5,"Great jelly roll recipe. I was looking for something I could use to make a yule log and tried 4 or 5 other recipes from various sources before I found this one. It tastes good and hold up really well to rolling, much better than other versions I've tried. It only took 14 minutes in my oven at 375 with the batter spread in an 11 x 17 pan. I rolled with a towel as soon as I took it out of the oven then let it cool like that for an hour before filling and frosting."
900320,94532,2008-08-04,1,"These were the worst muffins I have ever made, I put a little extra rasberries in the recipe, they were soggy in the center, and the orange zest made them almost bitter, they were gross! Sorry I have to be honest"
315269,152136,2012-04-11,5,This was my first time using quinoa.  How much healthier could you get than this recipe and it is yummy.  Thanks for posting.  I will be making this often.
51797,37047,2002-08-17,4,Easy cake to make. A substitute for the dry powdered sugar topping might be to add a teaspoon of vanilla and a tablespoon or so of milk to the powdered sugar to make a glaze topping.
5060,41870,2010-03-09,4,"Good 'ole green beans, always a favourite and nice with dill. I happened to have some beef broth to use up, it worked very well in place of the bouillon cube. I used some fresh green beans. We loved the dill flavour, I think it would be worth trying with fresh dill next time."
197023,104266,2008-08-03,5,"SO easy and SO delicious: WOW!  And like all soup recipes, very adaptable: if you don't have something on hand you can easily substitute something else.  I made this pretty much to the recipe, except for using baby carrots and increasing the basil and garlic a tad.  If I hadn't been planning on taking this to work for lunches during the coming week, I would have added some wine, perhaps inappropriately!  I used my Vegetable Stock
Recipe #135453 instead of water.  Still amazed by how quick this was to make.  Thanks, KelBel.  I'll be making this often."
621717,33598,2009-12-25,1,i must have done something wrong because the crumble topping just melted through the batter
296181,105707,2006-02-23,4,"This is a great dish, it has my daughter's favorite things-ham, cheese, pasta, and broccoli!  My husband and I really liked it too.  I did leave out the peppers and I used bread crumbs on the top.  Next time I would probably add just a little bit more Milk and Miracle Whip as it was slightly dry.  I will definitely make again!"
851590,290970,2008-08-28,3,"This recipe was pretty good. However, I found that the steak was very plain. I would make this again, however, I would add some steak spice. I served this meal with rice."
239758,304736,2008-06-17,5,Delicious and creamy risotto! It's very easy to make and the gorgonzola adds a wonderful depth of flavour. Also sprinkled on some parmesan. Yummo!
126440,153891,2009-12-25,5,I made half a recipe along with other appetizers.  Great flavor.  DH loved it and ate most of them.
9869,172084,2006-11-30,5,"Delicious fish dish, I used Gurnard fillets. Served with mashed potatoes, steamed green beans and fresh cob of corn. Easy to put together and nice flavours, a keeper for sure."
1346566,66121,2011-03-29,5,"This really does taste like P.F. Chang's Mongolian beef sauce. I made it with tofu instead of beef for my mom's birthday because she's a vegetarian and it was a big hit. Everyone, including my dedicated carnivore dad loved it!"
601528,203834,2010-06-28,5,"Amazing.  I used a tenderloin that was about 1.75 pounds, marinated the majority of the day, cut the loin into fourths, and then put it in the oven at 425 for about a half hour.  I basted with the marinade several times during cooking.  I was a bit worried that the curry powder would dominate here but it didn't, it complimented the rest of the ingredients quite well.  Seeing as how the 6 of us at the entire loin last night, this goes directly into my favorites.  Thank you!"
39547,57044,2005-02-28,5,"I really, REALLY liked this marinade.  The baked chicken it produced was nicely sweet (and I don't usually like sweetened meat) and citrus-y.  Very aromatic!  I used fresh grated ginger because I didn't have any ground.  I used freshly squeezed mandarine orange juice, which really made a difference, too, I feel.  I think that the marinade could've been even better with the addition of some Tabasco sauce for a little bite."
115470,44422,2005-10-25,4,These are fantastic LOOKING cookies but taste is really only so-so.  It's worth it for looks alone though - they're great.  I used marg and that might have been the difference.  I had bought a small tube of red gel and it was exactly enough but more might have been more fun!  
227978,273147,2008-09-29,5,"I've sampled cheese balls at various parties, but this was my first attempt at making a cheese ball. It's a bit softer than some of the cheese balls I've tried, but still firm enough to hold its shape (which chilling it for several hours is the key).  The flavor is a wonderful combination of sweet and cheesy flavors that make this the best cheese ball I've ever tried.  I will definitely make this again, and will keep this on hand for our annual family Christmas party and other gatherings."
22720,151038,2006-09-18,5,This is a great recipe. The sauce Is so good. It's fingerlicking good. I made extra and is still wasn't enough! Next time im gonna make a pot of it lol. The chicken was tender and sweet. The dish is perfect with over rice. Will make again and again and again :). Thanks for the recipe.
55729,15025,2003-06-27,4,"This turned out really well. I have to confess that the two of us devoured the whole recipe, so I would have to come up with a side dish to serve when the kids are home. It actually took 10 min. to cook the bratwurst, and it would have been another 10 min. to cook the peppers to the tender stage, but I only cooked them 5 because I got impatient. This is definitely a keeper."
168087,87259,2005-04-10,4,"This is a healthy mufin right?  Then i must say that this is a good healthy muffin.  Moist (even if i only added 6T of oil), and cut the sugar to 3/4 c (turned out, it really needs 1 c, coz the muffin doesn't have enought ""taste"" without the sugar).i also added plumped raisins, and cashews.  "
724631,334981,2009-04-11,5,"To be oft-repeated, this was wonderful and easy, the chicken tenderloins are perfect -- no slicing or pounding required!  We declared this a Top Menu, served with Recipe #353072 and Recipe #290458.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Acadia!  Made for Photo Tag."
91392,34335,2009-11-11,4,"Very nice, beautifully cooked pork, seasonings not as interesting as I had hoped.  Easy though."
1803638808,32082,2015-01-10,5,"It was incredibly awesome! Well, I don&#039;t like it. I love it loaded. :) thank you for sharing. I made cake and cupcakes. Yumminess overload!"
89831,321657,2009-02-09,5,"these are yummy! I didn't have any dark chocolate so I used semi-sweet and it still came out wonderful, I used digestive cookies that I had in my cupboard for a long time waiting to be used, these wonderful treats will be sent home with my son in a care package, thanks for sharing Noo!"
222055,224370,2007-09-25,5,I really loved this. I have had it twice now. The first time I pan fried it and the burger stayed nice and plump which helped keep the feta whole. The next time I used your method and used the George Foreman and my burger flattened out to a huge burger and I think it pressed all the goodies out. I used the extra leftover sauce in the bowl to dip my burger in. I really enjoyed it. Thank you Luv! PAC Fall 'o7.
292332,16501,2006-03-10,1,"Don't know what I did wrong, but chicken was dry and not too flavorful.  My kids definitely did not like this!"
226294,148347,2014-04-20,5,"Num num num num num!  Made these for our Easter gathering at the farm.  What a huge hit!  I baked half in a cupcake pan and the other (I have 24) on a large baking sheet at 325 for 20 minutes.  The rolls on the sheet spread much larger and had an airier texture, but the ones in the cupcake tins didn&#039;t disappoint either.  They were just smaller and a bit denser.  We loved both sizes, but my preference was the baking sheet rolls.  Thank you!"
5060,10284,2008-11-11,5,"Did just one up for DH for supper, he loved it!  Rather than fry it I did it in the oven on a rack, turned out lovely and crisp.
I did use a whole egg,  He loved the honey mustard flavour and would like to have it again, thanks for posting."
86359,423814,2010-08-18,3,My family did not like this and I made exactly as stated.  Nothing against your recipe just wasn't for us.
302094,157852,2006-03-21,3,I made this recipe and it is very good and kid friendly my kids loved it. It was easy and quick to prepare.
54885,76951,2003-11-29,5,i cheated and used frozen meatballs but the sauce was great i liked the liquid smoke flavor. i made them for thanksgiving and everyone loved them.
914360,494609,2013-02-02,5,This sounds awesome with the best of everything in one recipe !  Love it !
2360348,25999,2012-11-13,5,"This was a bit time consuming for me to prepare, but a big hit with the family. My mom said it taste just like Taco Bell and even bragged about it to her sister. The only one who wouldn't eat it was my oldest son who is super picky and refused to try it once he saw the little tomotoes from the salsa in there. He missed out though- big time!"
422893,99681,2007-08-04,4,"I made this with regular milk, vanilla chai teabags & left out the sugar, very nice afternoon pick me up thanks for a keeper!"
622300,72966,2008-06-22,4,Didn't have any peanut butter so I used Nutella. Yum! These turned out  great. Thanks for sharing!
353205,242772,2007-11-25,4,"These are a very good, fluffy dinner roll.  My family really enjoyed sopping up gravy from a roadt beef dinner with them.  Thanks for sharing!"
62988,15839,2002-12-02,3,"This was some what of a disappointment to me.  My guests and I were trying to figure out what it reminded us of....and finally someone said ""TUNAMELTS""!  Only half the dish was eaten (and it was the only thing I put out), so I told my husband he could make sandwiches out of it for lunch the next day.  Different, but not what I was shooting for."
2000907893,13745,2016-03-07,5,I used lemon jello and found that the vanilla extract really took away from the lemon flavor so I used lemon extract the next time and they were fab! I also rolled them in lemon sugar to give them an extra lemon kick.
1941849,3594,2011-08-10,5,"These were excellent! We used ground pork and substituted the tomato sauce for garlic and onion spaghetti sauce, added some boursin cheese, italian seasoning and some adobo seasoning then sprinkled these with mozzarella cheese."
114681,130916,2009-10-03,5,I am no real big fan of rice but I'll take this one.  The hint of lime is perfect.  I finished this after step 7 in the microwave.  Really couldn't believe just how nice it turned out.  Thanks!
22015,42069,2002-10-11,5,"This must be another Texas vs Missouri thing, like BBQ because up here we call this South St Louis Deep Gooey Butter Cake - whatever name you give it doesn't really matter because this is an awesome cake.  It's been a favorite in my family for over 20 years.  Glad you posted it Miss Annie because people should REALLY try this one."
66322,84489,2006-04-03,5,"Delicious, easy recipe.  Few ingredients, but so tasty.  I cut the recipe in half and made it with salmon steaks.  They came out so moist!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe."
763856,169257,2009-02-12,0,I made just the icing without pecans and coconut to go on an angel food cake for my DH's birthday (he does not like regular cake) and it was very delicious. I will have to try it with the cake another time as the cake sounds super as well.
134450,221284,2010-10-12,5,"I've been eating low carb for a long time and missed hot cereal. This is great, i toasted my bran and oat bran turned out wonderful. A little butter ,cream nutmeg and cinnamon. It does have a slight slick feel from the Flax but after the first bite i did not notice it. Can't wait for breakfast now."
209983,132998,2006-01-22,5,"I tagged this recipe on Zaar tag.  I really liked these! I also prepared your French Bearnais sauce at your suggestion and was glad that I did.  Thanks for posting a great recipe!!
Karen"
2001930325,393586,2018-01-14,1,"Not only does this not look or taste like olive gardens braised beef and tortellini, it's actually quite repulsive tasting. If I could give it less than 1 star I would."
112735,152530,2007-05-05,4,We used this recipe and added some chunks of steak and vegetables to the skewers.  We didn't have any barbeque spice so my husband put a little sprinkle of cayenne pepper on the kabobs before marinating. Very tasty!  Easy to make too.
306797,32042,2008-12-08,5,"What a fabulous meal!  We had this with chicken & sausage for dinner tonight & loved it.  This will be in our regular rotation, as DH just loved it.  Thanks for sharing this keeper."
546010,42169,2011-05-03,5,"Very good! I love that they have great flavor from the marinade and they are not heavily breaded. I omitted the butter drizzle and used a bit of olive oil.  An EZ & Tasty dinner, thanks Marie!"
166642,173572,2008-06-30,5,Great side dish with dinner tonight. Perfect amount of spices for us. Made for ZWT4 for the Tastebud Tickling Travellers.
693345,383042,2012-06-12,4,"We love the Travel Channel, and we often watch man v. food, and I've been wanting to try making these since I saw this episode. I have a version from America's Test Kitchen, but it seemed too fussy. These were just simple, and good. I only gave 4 stars, because we felt the 1/2 lb. burgers were HUMONGOUS! I halved the recipe for just my husband and me, and I grilled them on a grill pan on medium-high heat. I grilled them about 5 minutes on each side, to make sure the meat in the middle was cooked through, because the patties were SO large. I'm glad I finally tried to make these, but I guess I don't mind if the cheese is in or out!"
135271,30046,2007-02-23,4,Made it lunch one day and took it to work.  Was just what I needed for a filling lunch.
152393,183694,2007-02-10,4,"I used 2 - 1 lb. tenderloins, but kept the sauce ingredients the same.  Since I wasn't sure what time everyone would be home for dinner, this ended up cooking for about and hour longer than it was supposed to.  No problems, though.  It turned out tender and very flavorful.  I used the left-overs to make a pasta sauce!  Thanks for posting this yummy recipe, Debbie."
478451,173833,2011-04-20,5,I made this recipe for dinner and got rave reviews.  I added in some mushrooms and leftover chicken and doubled the sauce like another reviewer and served it over rice.  The next time I make this I will not add any salt as I thought that it was salty enough due to the soy sauce.  Thank you Galley Wench for posting a new family favourite.
740664,162385,2008-01-25,4,"I really liked this, but found the pork got a bit dry, but the sauce helps with that. The coleslaw recipe is great, but definitely needs to sit a little to meld. Good recipe for lunch at work. Thanks."
29996,65303,2003-06-30,0,I did not find this recipe to be all that good.  The apple corer does not make a very big hole and I barely had enough room to put the bacon in let alone the scallions and cheese.  I think it would work better if you used something larger than an apple corer.  I won't be making this again.
362983,24139,2010-02-25,5,"This is definitely one of my favourite things to make with my crock pot now! It was soo easy to boot. I doubled the sauce ingredients like suggested and it was perfect. I had it on high for about 3 hours and it smelled so incredible the entire time. I loved how the sauce really thickened up all on its own, since usually I have to thicken things up at the end with flour or cornstarch, but I'm so ecstatic that I didn't have to do any of that! Thank you soo much for this recipe!!"
601564,263050,2008-03-11,5,mmm! this was a great and light peach pie! i will for sure make this again when summer comes around!
253706,95022,2007-06-26,5,"YUMMY!! Sweet enough that we didn't even frost them, but I can only imagine....next time!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!"
95743,34382,2003-11-25,5,Delicous and much simpler to make than some other mashed garlic-potato recipes. Skipped the butter and didn't miss it a bit. Doubled the garlic.
13796,43506,2004-12-16,5,I fired up my Kitchen Aid mixer with the grinder attachment and put 2 1/4 lbs. of boneless pork loin into it and ground it twice with the herbs and spices. I added some extra black pepper and also added fennel seeds and dried crushed red pepper flakes. This was very good!! You know exactly what you're getting when you make it yourself. Thanks for a good recipe.  
131126,315063,2009-04-17,5,This was a nice vingarette.  I found it somewhat tart & added a pinch of sugar.  Made for Spring '09 Pick A Chef.
2001355321,22782,2017-01-17,0,I'm following your recipe as I type. I love spicy food so I added a few more peppers. Its not even done simmering and I can tell that it's amazing!! The smell of my home right now is palatable! Thank you!!
983268,3436,2008-11-05,5,Very good thank you...
225021,131941,2005-07-31,5,"WOW! Such a great presentation, and excellent in taste too! The dicing of the vegetables is quite time-consuming because you want to make sure the pieces are really small, but it looks soooooo pretty, I've already done this twice within a week! "
709527,185445,2008-11-01,5,Everyone at my Halloween party loved these cookies!  They will be made on a regular basis now!
279110,116173,2010-06-15,5,"LOVE IT!  I love everything about it!  I do add a slice of melted provalone to the sandwich-but everything else made to a ""t"".  Thank you for posting!  Won't make pulled pork any other way from now on!"
2001771006,76294,2017-10-29,5,Loved it
1185662,18039,2012-01-11,5,"This is such a good idea. It produces the most tender, juicy pork roast. There's no way I would have come up with this idea without this recipe, and I think it's a very versatile jumping off point. I loved the rosemary with the pork. I took other reviewers' advice and popped in half a sliced onion, a couple crushed cloves of garlic, and chicken broth in place of half the water. I often find pork roast comes out very tough, or nearly flavorless, even from the slow cooker. This was so delicious, tender, and juicy. I have no idea if leftovers would have been as good as the first shot, though I suspect they would be. My family devoured this entire roast in one sitting. It seriously took all my willpower to actually get it onto the serving plate. I could have eaten it whole, standing over the skillet. Thanks for posting!"
293901,131784,2006-07-21,5,"We had this salad for dinner on a day when the temp had reached 100.  It's easy, thrifty, fast to prepare and the flavors work wonderfully together. I used Vidalia onion (and added a little more to compensate for the milder flavor) because that's what I had.  The red onion would have been prettier.  This is definitely a keeper."
743654,146437,2008-04-30,3,"it was very easy to do
you see it done diffrently on tv"
429816,498729,2018-10-28,5,"This recipe is AMAZING. I have some food sensitivities (egg, flour among many others), so this is a life saver. I couldn't believe how much it tastes like egg foo yong. I subbed 2 T coconut flour and 1/4 c cassava flour for the wheat flour and tamari for the soy sauce, just fyi, and it was still great, and I'm positive it would be great with original ingredients too. I pan fried a couple patties and baked the others, and all were good. Thank You for posting this recipe, it gave me back an old time favorite takeout item!!!!!!"
1803626673,27733,2015-01-07,5,Healthy and good. I made with Panko instead of regular bread crumbs... Watch the cayenne useage if you have someone sensitive to spicy foods; a little goes a long way!  Take my word for it. Husband and kids loved it!
1298498,354939,2012-05-06,3,While the idea seemed good-- it was missing something. Don't think I will make it again.
52448,67674,2004-10-28,5,"Very good sauce! Served it with some simple baked chicken breasts and a salad. The sauce leaves room to spice up with some chilies and garlic, which I will do next time!"
48902,50637,2012-07-11,4,This is such a great basic recipe that can be customized to a families particular tastes.  The only 2 things that were negative (and they weren't major). One was that the meatloaf was too moist and fell apart. (Maybe more cracker crumbs or less ketchup or leaner meat?) There wasn't nearly enough potatoes for everyone considering there was 2-1/2 pounds of meat.  I would definetely double or maybe even triple the amount of potatoes. Otherwise I really liked it.  Especially when I used seasoned salt and garlic on the potatoes after retrieving them. Thanks Melanie for sharing.
2511341,472598,2012-11-19,5,"FINALLY an albondigas recipe that's AUTHENTIC!! Everyone uses cilantro in their recipes for This meatball and IT""S MINT that's used!!!!The other ingredients are all correct & the prep too!! It is a WONDERFUL ,delicious meatball, prepared correctly.! Thank you for posting the ONLY recipe I've seen on here that uses mint , not cilantro. Cilantro has it's place but not in albondigas.many people mistakenly believe they can be used interchangably one for the other. NOT TRUE!!"
116401,242503,2011-04-18,0,"Milk or no millk, no matter what bread you use, this stuff is awesome.love it!Thanks:)PeggyLynn"
1280189,69630,2009-08-15,5,WOW! I made this for my son's birthday party. I got so many compliments and several people asked for the recipe. Even my super picky eater friend stopped me to tell me how much he liked it. My Father in Law asked me to make it for our huge family reunion he liked it so much. Thanks!  I used Kittencal's Creamy White Buttercream Frosting/Icing with the almond flavouring option.  Delish.
222564,53443,2011-11-28,5,"This turned out fantastic, but I did doctor it up a bit. To the potatoes I added zing with 3 tbs brown sugar, 1 ts salt and chili powder and 1/4 ts cayenne. To the peppers I added 2 tbs brine from a jalapeno jar."
854597,97023,2008-06-13,5,"Jen,
I tried this Recipe again this evening and it is wonderful !!!
Just as good as Quincey's. I tried this recipe before and ruined it by placing it on top of a hot stove to rise which, killed the Yeast. This time I made sure not to make that mistake again. 
I have been looking for this recipe for years and now I will be using it weekly. Thank you so much for posting this THE ULTIMATE YEAST ROLL RECIPE!!!!!"
364143,128706,2007-09-25,5,"Made this yesterday for the hubby and myself. Anything with macaroni and cheese and tomatoes in it is delicious! Glad I found this recipe, we love vidalias!"
768039,338351,2009-01-29,5,"These are GREAT! I was afraid that I had done something wrong at first, the dough was so very wet. It sort of oozed on the baking sheet. I seriously considered scrapping the entire batch, but, I make an assortment of biscotti, and they don't all have the same consistency raw.  I persevered, and was rewarded with a tasty, very pretty cookie. These look like something out of a Martha Stewart photo shoot. My customers loved them. I will put this recipe into my regular rotation, thanks for it, Katii!
Update - i made this recipe again today, using a different blend of gluten free flours. There really is a vast difference in blends, I guess. This time the dough was  very dry. I had a hard time bringing all the ingredients together. The dough didn't spread out at all, just remained in the same shape I put it in the oven at. The flavor was good, but this batch wasn't nearly as pretty as my last. A big surprise to me, but a good learning experience too."
251054,255948,2008-01-27,5,I loved this recipe. I didn't change a thing. I didn't think anything needed to be changed. This will definately be a keeper in my family for something warm to eat during the winter months. Thanks for sharing.
469528,15242,2007-10-15,3,"I thought this was just okay.  It seems like there are a lot of other hashbrown potato recipes out there that have a little more taste than this did.  It was kind of bland.  Probably won't make it again, but it was worth trying."
1945611,133122,2012-01-21,5,"Thank you Kittencal! This is my GO TO Chocolate Cake Recipe. Way more than a ""snack cake"".<br/> I usually make cupcakes with it.  It makes about 18 cupcakes if you fill the cups 3/4 of the way.  Cupcakes take about 18-20 mins at 350. This cake is sooooooooo good.   I don't eat sugar, so I used whey low in this recipe and NO ONE can tell the difference.  I've also made with a variety of flours (gluten-free, low carb, whole wheat pastry flour) and it's just as good.  And since I'm already using unsweetened choocolate squares, here is the EASY frosting that I use:<br/><br/>Old Fashioned Hard Fudge Frosting:<br/>1 cup sugar<br/>1/2 cup milk<br/>1 tsp. butter<br/>1 tsp. vanilla<br/>2 squares unsweetened chocolate<br/><br/>Add sugar and milk, butter. Stir until boils HARD! Boil HARD 6 minutes. Don't stir while boiling. Remove from heat. Add vanilla and chocolate. Stir until chocolate melted. Pour over cake. Will be a hard, shiny frosting. Tastes like fudge. Frosting sets up very quickly."
1283421,169035,2010-05-20,5,"Wow!  I didn't know what to expect, but I am SO glad I tried it!  I used the ""hot"" breakfast sausage, brown rice, and colby-jack cheese.  The only other change I made was to add a can of drained and rinsed black beans.  (It still fit perfectly into an 8 x 8 x 2 casserole.)"
1557767,76670,2010-02-20,5,"Thank you for publishing this very authentic recipe!  I lost the original that my Baba had passed on to my mother and missed this simple wonderful food, now I can make my own!  I add caraway seeds to mine and they turn out the same as my Baba used to make!  Great with Chicken, Pork or Veal roast and sauerkraut!"
128473,500249,2013-05-27,5,"I love garlic mashed potatoes and these did not disappoint.  So yummy, great garlic flavor, soft tender potatoes, just the way I love them.  Thank you for sharing a recipe that I will make again and again.  It was quick and easy to make with great results.  Just perfect served with spareribs and green beans.  Made for New Kids on the Block Tag Game."
1206102,456629,2012-07-10,5,"At last, a kitchen activity my husband enjoys doing with me!  We made a lovely huge platter of various rolls recently, to take to a party, and had so much fun that we're doing it again this weekend!  And how delicious.  Next time we'll make extra to ""steal"" before serving!"
92816,27210,2010-03-14,5,These are perfect on my indoor grill.They have just the right amount of flovour with the lemon pepper seasoning.I halved the ingredients to make it for 2 servings.
29655,305987,2008-06-28,3,"I wasn't fond of these but DD loved them!  I'm not real fond of wheat germ and I felt that was one of the main flavors here.  However, the muffins came out great and were not dry.  I will keep this recipe in mind for when I'm baking snacks for the kiddos.  Reviewed for ZWT4"
87023,62619,2003-05-31,5,I make this soup which I love but I omit soy sauce as some ham hocks can be quite salty
969481,83770,2013-07-27,5,"Yum, yum, and yum is all I have to say. I&#039;ve never cooked with Bok Choy. I&#039;m so glad this was the first recipe I tried!!! My spouse even said &quot;Nice dish!&quot; (and to hear that from my picky eater says a lot!). I added some asparagus spears I needed to use up and I thought the sauce thickened perfectly.This one is being added to the recipe book and will make again! Thanks for sharing."
489552,49353,2009-07-25,5,"This was so easy and really good, and I like easy and good.  I used fresh herbs from my garden which added an excellent flavor to the this.  I will make again when I crave Mexican rice in a hurray :)"
491437,2495,2007-11-09,4,"This chocolate cake turned out well - I received many compliments.  It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked, which I believe was my fault as read shortening and used crisco (I think I would have rather used butter).  Very easy, too!"
133956,27520,2014-04-04,5,"This is impossibly delicious for how easy it is! Unbelievable!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I added a little basil, some mushrooms and eggplant. I had leftover veggies I wanted to use up and they turned out wonderfully in this. I also melted in some shredded mozzarella and cheddar cheese toward the end (because everything is better with cheese!). So good. I have a feeling I will be making this very often :)"
621626,278395,2009-11-21,5,Yummy! I cut 4 apples into chunks then scattered in the bottom of a baking pan with the other ingredients. I then laid the crescent roll sheet over top of the apples. I also used more Mountain Dew as others suggested. Made for PRMR Tag
50151,108231,2005-02-22,5,This was great!!  Hubby is not always a soup fan but I think he was surprised at how much he loved this.  We like spicy things so we added a little more cayenne.  I loved how easy this was to make.  We will definately be making this again!!  Thanks for sharing.
169430,232118,2007-06-07,5,"Very good burger (and thats coming from and anti burger person).

201887,321529,2008-10-15,5,"I have to give this recipe 2 thumbs up. It was fast, easy and I had all the ingredients on hand. I had a couple extra cups of sauce so I threw it in there and added 4 more lasagna noodles. We dont care for ricotta so I added a bit more mozzarella.  My guys loved it and my 19yr old asked me where I had found the recipe.  He has NEVER asked me that before.  Enjoy this recipe - I do recommend you add some Italian seasoning..it adds more flavor. 

Thanks Lainey6605 for a wonderful recipe."
114681,20577,2007-02-28,5,Yes sir Uncle Bill does it again!  I used Rotella crushed tomatoes with chilies instead of the plum and some really crappy Vodka one of my cheap friends left.  Turned out super.  Thanks for a home for cheap Vodka!
117010,66596,2004-08-28,5,"I made this salad for some friends and they loved it so much, I had to give away the copy I had printed for myself. It's going to be in my cook book for generations."
2001155636,516527,2016-09-05,5,"Made this for dinner tonight and it was fantastic! The only thing I changed was the cooking time The chops I was using were about 2 and a half inches thick, so I upped it to about 55 minutes in the oven. They came out perfectly! The seasoning is simple, but perfect. I used freshly grated cheese, the saltiness was just right."
108902,24978,2008-04-04,4,This is really good bread but mine came out a bit dense for my taste. I'll definitely be trying it again and make a few adjustments. The crust tip was very helpful - thank you!
707391,114393,2011-09-17,5,"I have made this recipe about 5 times. Every time it has came out great. My wife who is not a big fan of onions, actually loves this. We try it all kinds of things. Very easy and delicious."
131751,96973,2005-11-26,5,This dessert is so good!! I used graham cracker pie crusts and made two pies for Thanksgiving; one of which my husband devoured in one day. He gave it 10 stars.
53932,175399,2008-02-05,5,We thought this chili was great.  The only change I made was to use less water (about half the amount listed) as we prefer a chunkier chili.  The seasonings were just right.
308889,147653,2006-11-01,5,"These were so easy and oh so good!!  We ate them right out of the oven still warm, so that the cream cheese frosted melted slightly.  Delicious!!"
424680,409510,2011-06-30,5,"I've love to give you a lot more stars for this recipe ~ So easy to make, & absolutely delicious! I used frozen berries this time around, but fully intend to be making this recipe time & time again during the summer months! I especially liked dipping bananas & sliced peaches in this one! Thanks for the great keeper! [Made & reviewed in Everyday Is a Holiday recipe tag]"
481092,255453,2008-08-06,5,"Goat cheese on a pizza?  Wow!!  Amazing. I didn't use any tomato sauce.  Wonderful pizza.  It was a little soggy in the middle, but still really good. Perfect flavor combination."
164538,105451,2006-08-02,5,"This recipe is definately a keeper! It was delicious! It cooked up quickly and had wonderful flavor. And best of all I didnt have to turn the oven on. I didnt have a gravy with pimentos so I added green pepper to the onion and garlic it turned out great. I made a big tossed salad and and followed the lead and made mashed potatoes to serve with this meal.
My son and his wife loved the meal and when they were done they cleaned up and put the leftovers in the fridge. We always lable and date everything that goes into the freezer and fridge so when I got up this morning to get my coffee creamer out there sat our leftovers labeled ""Lani Kai Pork Chops 8/1/06"". So its official these arent just any pork chops they are ""Lani Kai pork chops! "
305531,318320,2014-07-03,5,Yum! This was super simple and delish. I only made 2 chicken breasts but all of the sauce and it was just right for us. Thanks for sharing this nice recipe. Made for For Your Consideration tag.
784074,66412,2010-06-30,5,"Easy, simple, and delicious. I use any red wine and it still tastes wonderful all the time."
220166,59444,2007-07-11,5,"I was trying to decide if I should rate this 4 or 5 stars, and I came to the conclusion that I was going to rate it 5. The brisket and the sauce had a WONDERFUL flavor! I loved it... The only problem was, it was very tough. I smoked it for almost 6 hours. Next time I make this I will smoke it about 8-10. Thanks for posting!!

Edited on July 11 2007 to say:  I made again and smoked it about 10 hours!  It was falling apart!  I am so glad you posted this!!"
140028,23232,2008-09-15,5,Delicious! I just sprinkled the spices on the roast instead of measuring them out.
2000998875,358839,2016-05-04,0,"For the &quot;ladies&quot; too funny. The TRPV1 activation via the capsaicin in chili peppers in not gender selective. It is a reaction that humans have to agonists, huge hairy men and tiny dainty ladies will all, as one, feel the burn from any such chemical. Wise up..."
2001410644,90096,2017-08-13,3,"The flavor was good, but found that there was too much cream cheese, leaving the result rather soupy. I'll try it again with about 1/3-1/2 the amount of cream cheese and see how that turns out."
6357,78834,2003-12-15,5,"Woah, this was fun to make for my younger brother for whom I have been playing momma since the last few days. He laughed and ate 'em all. Thank you so much for the creative idea! BTW, my bro is 19 and if he loved these, I'm sure everyone will:) Thanks again for the fun idea!"
24593,100756,2005-04-23,5,"I only had macadamia nuts to hand so ground them and used them.  I also used olive oil to fry the onion and mushrooms in. 

The recipe was very delicious.   Easy to make.

212609,478936,2013-04-16,5,What an awesome sandwich!!&lt;br/&gt;This was jam packed with yumminess....a total flavour experience!&lt;br/&gt;A real winner here...my DH thanks you wholeheartedly!!&lt;br/&gt;Made for PRMR.
1421392,439656,2010-10-31,4,I made this last night and used Loaded Potato instant mashed potatoes.  I also put the mini loaves back in the oven once I topped them with potatoes so they were a little crunchy on top.  It was very good!  Great easy idea!
1042443,333876,2008-12-12,4,"Very Good.  Enjoyed by all family including ""fussy"" daughter.  I also used milk in the mash (I used frozen mash: blush).  Will certainly be doing this again."
181654,24981,2009-01-22,5,"This is one of my favorite recipes of all times!!! My daughter had to make a snack for her class that started with the letter N, so we used this recipe and made nests, we filled them with speckled jelly beans. They look adorable!"
353579,219575,2007-07-26,5,"These were really good and a big hit with everyone.  I made half with the butterscotch topping and the other half with some chocolate chips added in - they were both good, but I preferred the original version.  I was afraid these would be overly sweet, but they were just fine.  Thanks for sharing!"
2080671,196827,2014-07-21,4,"We used the dough for fried spring rolls, and we really enjoyed the taste. However, we has a tough time rolling out the dough since it&#039;s sticky. After trying wax paper, flour, and oil, we got lucky with plastic wrap. We placed plastic wrap between the dough and the counter top, as well as on top of the dough before using the rolling pin. That process was rather easy. We will be using this recipe again!"
450636,84516,2008-02-05,4,"Amazing! What a treat to find such a delicious pizza substitute. The base was kinda like an omelet, but held together really well, and the herbs added extra flavour. Thanks for posting xx"
553862,260317,2010-06-27,4,"I made this just as listed, except I used about 1/2 as much oil.  It was a very nice side dish, - perfect for when you want  something a little out of the ordinary.  I had not eaten daikon cooked this way before and given the ingredients, I was surprised by how mild it become when stir fried.     Be sure and not overcook the radish, because it looses its crunch pretty quickly."
232532,104352,2007-05-25,5,I think this is fabulous. I can handle my low-carb diet much better having this in the fridge.
463435,412357,2010-03-07,5,"I am so thrilled to have this spice blend in my spice cabinet now! All of the commercial BBQ seasoning blends I have found contain MSG so I have had to bypass them. I haven't tried this blend on any recipes yet however, I dipped my finger in the bowl which my daughter and I combined the spices in and I can tell you that the taste was wonderful. I cut this back to 1/4 of the recipe but I will be keeping the ingredient list handy so I can make it again and again. Thanks for posting. Made and reviewed for the 38th AUS/NZ Recipe Swap."
2001025699,35393,2018-02-20,5,"These turned out amazing!! Perfect thin crunchy outer shell, super soft on the inside. The taste of strawberry was not strong enough for me, so I would possibly change this next time, but these were AMAZING! Also, I only cooked for 13 minutes, but could just be my oven!!"
724516,399079,2011-02-08,5,"I don't know if this was how it was meant to turn out as I cut the recipe down to two servings, sometimes it will go wrong but it didn't taste or look wrong, it was very nice. I had it on its own with a bit of salad for lunch, it was like a mini souffle. The croutons I used were recipe#301695#301695 which are nice on there own especially if they are made from nice bread. I used recipe#447016#447016 its a really nice bread, and what better way to use the last of the loaf, it has seeds in it so I got a very nice savoury pudding with the combination. I used skimmed milk and extra low fat cheddar for the top, also I sauteed the onion and mushroom in a wee spray of oil. thank you for posting made for happy hearts 2011"
131126,464006,2013-04-04,5,"I used smoked turkey and a paninni press, but otherwise followed the recipe. Quick and delicious!  Made for Spring 2013 Pick A Chef."
133174,287908,2008-04-25,5,This is wonderful.  There are times when nothing beats comfort.  The recipe was reduced to 2 servings and made a very nice lunch for DH and me.  It was served with recipe #291664 and they complimented each other well.  I will save this for those Spam cravings.  Made for *PAC Spring 2008*
256881,150809,2007-04-26,3,"it was good, but seemed a bit bland. Had to add some chicken broth to it, as it was a bit dry. Kids didn't much care for it, but DH and I ate it up."
30534,37682,2002-11-02,5,"A sensational chicken casserole. Another ""to die for recipe"" from Mark. My Velveeta was at rooom temperature and too soft to grate. I melted 12 oz of the cheese in the mushroom soup and added to the rest of the mixture to cool before adding the beaten eggs. After baking and letting the casserole sit for 10 minutes, it was a bit watery.
Next time I would decrease the amount of chicken broth by 1/4 cup. This would be a perfect dish for a party buffet or a potluck supper."
328023,240359,2010-11-18,5,"If I could give this 10 stars, I would!!!  This recipe is absolutely fantastic.  TOTALLY easy to make, one dish meal, and sooooooo heavenly!!!  Thank you, Greg, for sharing!  I made only one small change: I used a 1/2 cup of chopped fresh parsley and a 1/2 cup of chopped fresh basil.  I love fresh basil, and it's readily available, so why not?  <br/><br/>Yesterday, I ate cioppino out at a very fancy seafood restaurant in Houston's Galleria mall.  That meal was what inspired me to try making it for myself.  I just have to say, this tasted even better than that $25 bowl at the restaurant!  It was SOOO good, I had seconds, and sopped up every last drop of the sauce with yummy toasted sourdough bread.<br/><br/>This recipe WILL be my xmas eve meal for my family.  I really can't say enough great things about it!!!!! =)"
431475,116908,2013-09-29,0,Very tasty and easy to make. I had a bumper crop of pears so I have been looking for ways to cook with them. I also added white mushrooms (had some that needed to be cooked right away). That worked well with this recipe. I served it with Minute Rice Multi-Grain Medley with a pinch of saffron- delicious!
424680,444135,2011-04-27,5,"Followed the recipe right on down, using the pitted plums/prunes rather than the dates, & found the plums & apples to be a wonderfully satisfying fruit combo! Thanks for sharing this keeper of a recipe! [Made & reviewed in Everyday Is a Holiday tag]"
212359,3333,2007-11-18,5,"I love dirt cake.  It rocks.  I have made it every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas for as long as I started partaking in making food for the holidays.  I add a cup of powdered sugar to mine though.  I don't put it in a flower pot, but that is a cute idea.  I think I also you two packages of cream cheese.  YUM!"
542159,202598,2012-11-04,5,Extraordinary!! The taste and easy make these an easy 10 star and earn them a place in my best of 2012 book. Could not get regular lamb chops so had to use center loin lamb chops which were perfectly cooked right at the 6 minute mark. Thanks so very much for the great post.
145626,66575,2007-04-26,5,"Outstanding!  First I was excited because I had all ingredients on hand - and usually do.  This made a huge bowl but that didn't stop my family from snarfing in down fast!  I would make one change although it wouldn't alter the flavor:  I would only add the juice from the pineapple chunks and drain the peach juice.  I had an abbundance of juice that just went down the drain after we'd finished the salad.  If it weren't so runny, the thicker sauce would stick to the fruit better and be more enjoyable.  Also, a note to anyone first trying this, my pudding mix left little lumps at first, but they dissolved after a bit of chill time.  I can see myself making this many time this summer!  Thank you laura70!"
925054,107281,2010-03-31,5,"Great soup.  My sweetie and I love it!  I've made it twice now, and tonight I doubled the meatball recipe and froze half to use for the next time I make it.  This time I also used two fresh tomatoes instead of the canned, and either way tastes great!  Thanks for sharing a delicious recipe!"
95214,71323,2005-06-14,5,This is one of my husbands favorite recipes.  It also freezes very well and makes alot.  This is something I make often when preparing a meal to bring over to someone.
57222,25407,2005-04-11,4,Very tasty! I found the garlic-ginger ratio just perfect but would likely reduce the amount of vinegar next time - the sauce was just a touch too vinegar-y for my taste! I added onion and red pepper and used about 1 cup of mozzarella. Will certainly get made again! Thanks for sharing!
1266226,51537,2009-06-14,5,"this was great! like melanie2590, i also made the crust with 1/2 butter and 1/2 oil. everyone raved about how great it was! used this for Recipe #375024. i will def make this again!
thanks for posting."
104295,66390,2004-08-10,4,This was nice.  I think next time I will not take as much of the insides out of the tomato.  I used olive oil instead of butter and added some garlic to the onions.  Very nice with home grown tomatoes as a side dish.  I served it with a main dish that was not high in protein and it worked out well.
412186,48950,2007-10-12,4,This was very good and easy to put togetherMade just as directed will make again.
1539119,64895,2010-02-01,5,They really are the best! I have been tryin to find a good brownie recipe for a while and this is the best. They needed afew extra minutes in the oven but other than that the recipe is perfect.
49168,69429,2005-11-26,5,"
This bundt cake is wonderful!!  Thank You for a great recipe!  "
38418,57886,2006-07-11,5,"Perfect!  This is better than any candy bar. I used vanilla ice cream and Amaretto for the creme de noyaux . I put a squirt of whipped cream on top, too.  Thanks for sharing! :o)"
1171848,281049,2009-05-26,0,"I like this recipe for a quick dinner but instead of sausage i sliced 4 hot dogs and fried them til golden and added to other ingredients, I like hot dogs better than sausage."
85826,168634,2014-03-05,5,I made this with great success with cup4cup gf flour. This is a great recipe. Thanks.
163112,451167,2011-07-06,5,"this is fabulous!  I think it could use more jalapeno.  that zippy bite every so often was a wonderful contrast to the sweet fruit.  the lime really perked things up, too & kept it from being too sweet.  I think this would be great to multiply & add to a dessert buffet.  Thank you!  Made for Veggie Swap."
65502,47132,2002-12-26,5,"This recipe is incredible! I baked it for 8 of us on Christmas morning. I prepared it the night before with all low-fat dairy ingredients. I cut up a baguette for the bread, and the crusts really added some texture. I should have cooked it for a bit longer because it was cold from being in the fridge overnight. After 5 minutes in the microwave, it was ready to go though. (It was a little bit rubbery because of the microwave - my fault!).
Try this one - it's great!!! "
488587,100805,2008-06-04,5,"This is what I have been looking for. My grandma uses vermicelli pieces just like this recipe, but I have never used it to make rice pilaf. 
Thank you for sharing!"
2921292,369168,2013-07-28,3,I found the chicken kind of bland. Perhaps a brine followed by a spice rub and skillet blackening would work better?
154322,104630,2006-08-25,4,"This recipe reduced to two servings very easily(FYI 1/16 cup = 1 Tbsp).I added half a grilled chicken breast to one serving, and some mozzarella on top of both.  Bowtie pasta worked well, and garden fresh tomatoes are ideal!  Very smooth taste, but I could have used a little more of a kick.  Maybe more garlic next time...  Really good combination of flavors.  Thanks"
22015,130793,2008-01-20,5,This was terrific.   Great cake texture.   Not overly moist but definitely not dry - just light.   I used the two egg whites and beat them a bit before adding the cake mix.   I also used a chocolate fudge cake mix with chocolate covered cherry Dr Pepper.   I only got a slight after taste from the soda that was barely noticable.   I will definitely make this one again.
392268,53198,2014-06-20,5,Best quick meal idea! I omitted the cheese and used nonfat sour cream. Not too overpowering and the fish was super moist!
169430,458903,2011-08-11,5,Made with one slight change I had apricot necter on hand so I used that. Still very yum. DH and I almost polished it of sitting outdoors and talking about plans for next years yard improvement. It's a good thing that talk is cheap and iced tea is wonderful. lol.
2001243314,446687,2016-11-12,5,Thank You very much! Very delicious :-)
64934,133699,2006-02-22,5,"This was a winner!  I also doubled up on the cream of chicken soup and added only 1/4 cup of milk.  I used the frozen mixed California vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower and carrots).  After the 40 minutes, I turned the broiler on for a couple of minutes to crisp up the tater tots!  End result was a very tasty supper!  Thanks Sheri!"
568854,17058,2009-07-01,5,"This was quite good - nice creamy texture.  Sorry - I typically follow the recipe the first go around but didn't today (had no celery or eggs boiled).  I did only use half the amount of celery seed and cider vinegar.  I used cream, green onions, 1/4 tsp. dry mustard and a few strips of diced bacon.  I was a little surprised at the sweetness but everyone liked it just the way it was.  I would definitely make this again.  I think my changes were not different enough to alter the original recipe taste so I would rate it 5 stars.

204024,241166,2008-09-14,5,"A really nice oatmeal cookie!  We used chopped walnuts and pecans. Grinding half the oats is a new idea to us, and gave the cookies a distinctive texture. We made half a batch and it still made 7 dozen cookies, which were probably smaller than LifeIsGood made them.  Made for OZ/NZ swap #20, Sept. 2008."
226066,109547,2010-04-11,5,Frosted this delicious cake with recipe #55530! I am on WW and was glad to find a healthy cake that I would enjoy! Made it for Easter and it was a hit!! Used maple syrup instead of honey was the only change I made! Thanks for sharing! :)
213139,128222,2011-06-23,4,"This recipe was appealing to me because I love cornmeal coated fish, but don't like all the fat from frying it.  While it was good, we thought it could have used a little more spice.  Will make this again and add additional spices.  Made for Healthy Choices ABC Tag."
174096,310625,2010-04-25,5,"Wonderful!  I only needed 2, so I used 2 small ramekins.  I also threw in some chopped portabella mushroom with the green pepper and onion.  This was a big hit - we loved the Parmesan crust on top.  Thanks for sharing!"
2000241142,228509,2017-03-14,3,"Irish soda bread consists of Flour, Salt, Baking Soda, Buttermilk. Nothing else. I'm sure this is a lovely tasting bread but it is not authentic."
1655195,14911,2011-12-29,5,"Yum! This is a keeper! I had never made this type of gravy before, and it was perfect. Hubby says we could have it every week (as he polishes off half of it!). I used Jimmy Dean hot sausage, a teaspoon or more of kosher salt, and a very generous dash of black pepper. Would be great for brunches, a quick weeknight supper, for breakfast when having overnight guests, etc. Thanks for posting."
2000918910,137635,2017-03-27,5,OMG! Exactly the flavor I was craving. Definitely a keeper.
485109,389021,2010-04-04,4,"I love the flavours of tomato and basil combined. I've never tried basil in a sandwich and it actually worked really well. The mayo I used tasted very ""eggy"" and next time I'd try this with either a very light spread of butter or some plain yoghurt, so the basil and tomato flavours aren't overpowered. Thanks for a really nice sandwich recipe!"
29782,98312,2005-01-29,5,"Boy!!!  I love this recipe :)   AWESOME!! 
Words can't describe how much this does taste better than store brought. Just say I know I will be making these every week from now on. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe from the bottom of my heart!  
I love fudgesicles! Can ya tell?   heheheheee"
29782,129403,2007-12-05,4,"Delicious recipe. Our steaks were tender and juicy and had a very nice flavor.  I let marinade about 3hrs. 
Thanks for sharing the recipe!"
171303,10840,2009-05-26,5,What a great rub.  Used it on some babyback ribs and they were wonderfully flavorful.   Thank you Luvmybge for sharing the recipe.
27783,15198,2003-06-04,4,"These are very, very rich & quite tasty.  You really need to have a huge sweet tooth for these rice krispy treats!  I enjoyed these, but next time I would cut the chocolate mixture in half - it was so thick, rich & a litle too sweet that not everyone enjoyed them as much.  However - these are still very good and I think would be excellent bake sale fare."
441162,288424,2008-10-22,4,"I used the pork and shrimp combo with water chestnuts and carrots. Made exactly as directed and served with soy sauce, chili flakes and lemon. Superb!"
129958,187440,2007-01-05,5,"Five stars for simple, fast and good! I love ham and cheese casseroles and this recipe hit the spot!  I prepared it for supper tonight just for myself and so I would have leftovers.  It was great comfort food on a rainy night and after a very tiring week at work.  Thanks gruntlady, this is a keeper!"
121690,215350,2007-04-27,5,"Wow, so easy!. Filling and warm and tasty on a cold rainy day. I used beans, but will definitely be trying it with potatoes. A keeper!"
259997,203145,2007-01-08,5,"I have been trying so many different meatball recipes, also in search for the perfect one. I have found some that I really like, but so far these are the  ""best meatballs""! I think the red pepper does give them that something extra. Also the full cup of bread crumbs and 1/4 of cheese keeps them tender and moist. So as I said even though I found others that I like, this recipe has topped even those so I think this will be the one I use from now on. Thanks Amber!"
226863,464092,2011-11-06,5,"What a wonderful surprise!  I used ground round and cooked it with the onions before mixing with the okra, tomatoes, and spices.  I also added some salt. I've never used cinnamon and allspice with okra before, but it worked wonderfully.  The crispy sliced garlic was the perfect garnishment.  Thanks for sharing!"
209747,66527,2005-11-23,4,"Good recipe but very high in fat and calories. Made healthier by sauteeing chicken in nonstick pan- no oil, used broth instead of milk and regular cooked rice instead of instant. Also used reduced fat soup. Thanks for sharing this recipe! "
6357,94773,2004-07-02,5,This is a pretty good cake. I made it substituting the sour cream with plain fat-free yogurt. It went so well with our evening cup of chai! Thanks for sharing!
6357,83509,2004-12-29,4,"Tomorrow it's my dad's 54th birthday:-) I've made this dessert for him as he loves desserts and particularly those in which Milk is a vital ingredient. This has come out very well. I used a pinch a salt too as the other reviewer did. A cooking tip which I have learnt is when you make desserts, always add a pinch of salt to them while cooking. The flavour is enhanced almost MAGICALLY. I have tried this before with semolina halwa and it works like a charm! So, I had to share...try this dessert by adding 2 pinches of salt like I did, and then you will just love the taste. It will be much much better than without adding salt. I did not have saffron on hand, so I used 2 drops of yellow food colour{liquid}. The colour has come out very very pretty...I call this shade of yellow ""baby yellow"" because it is just as soft and light, yet distinct, as a little baby:) I did not have almonds and pistachios on hand, so I used lightly toasted cashewnuts as a substitute. I used 21 ground green cardamom pods to make this{we like more cardamom and the flavour is absolutely tantalising!}. One additional ingredient I used other than the salt for this recipe, is 1 1/2 tbsps. of Nestle sweetened condensed milk. This made the recipe get that ""oomph"" and ""aha"" that was missing. While cooking, when I did the taste test of this, I found that even with 7 heaped tbsps. of sugar, the sugar was still a little less than what my family's taste buds are tuned to enjoy. So, I added in 1 1/2 tbsps. of the sweetened condensed milk and continued to stir very well. I am so glad I added this additional ingredient, because, now, sitting right in front of me, is the yummiest dessert I have cooked in the year! The ground rice is the best part of this recipe. It really gives the phirni a wonderfully creamy texture. This recipe requires alot of patience and skill while cooking{so as to not let the milk stick to the bottom of the pot, you got to keep on stirring it continuously}. The final result is REALLY well worth all the effort that goes into making the dessert. I can't wait for Dad to dig into this after lunch tomorrow...will have to hide some somewhere otherwise our guests will have it all and dad will be a cranky baby on his birthday! lol....thanks a tonne for a yummy recipe! 
Here's wishing you a belated Merry Christmas and a Happy 2005!

220151,118761,2011-02-06,5,I did this recipe because my husband was really hungry and it only took me 4 minutes; one per egg. This was very good and loved the clean up time too. Thank you for sharing this.Chef#220151.
1799112,486641,2017-04-05,5,"Love this banana bread! So simple, basic ingredients, easy to follow instructions, really moist and tasty bread. No changes made, I followed the recipe and baked it in little loaf pans. Delicious !"
539159,34499,2009-02-11,4,"Delicious Pork.  I used boneless pork chops, cutting off all visible fat before cooking.  I followed a suggestion from another reviewer to add Tabasco & Worcestershire sauce.  Served it with left over mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  One of the men loved dipping his broccoli in the sauce.  He wants his broccoli with this sauce from now on.   Husband loved the sauce on his potatoes.  Also (as recommended) cooked it 48 minutes and 25 minutes after the sauce was added.  I forgot to cover the meat for the first 48 minutes.  No problem.  Meat was tender, moist, and delicious, and completely cooked, even though my boneless chops were pretty thick."
717898,80470,2009-10-11,5,"My 6 year old  daughter and I just baked these together (side by side).  We each double the recipe. She insisted that her batch tastes better.  We baked 5 dozen cookies and we froze the rest into cookie dough logs for the next time we have a chocolate chip craving.  I guessing that what is in the freezer will make about 4 dozen cookies.  They are gooey, melty, chewy and delicious.  
My daughter says to write...""MMMmm... Yummy""  LOL
We had alot of fun and did a little math lesson at the same time."
142386,54426,2005-11-19,5,I made this just like the recipe stated.  This is a very RICH treat.  I served at a party and they wanted more and more.  Thank you.
307214,141151,2010-02-13,5,"Really great.  With my changes of using leftover roast and water to steam the broccoli, it gets a 4 and then a 5 for the next day (took longer for the flavours to meld with the leftover beef, next time I would add beef broth instead of water). 
This is a quick every day meal, if I was serving it to company, I would use more traditional noodles."
1363303,381564,2009-08-25,4,"This is pretty easy to make and it's yummy.  It's crunchier than the ones purchased at the store (Century Bakery, Century Mall in San Jose, Ca.)"
199697,116522,2009-12-22,4,We had this last night and DH liked it a lot.  It was very moist and flavorful.  I did put some onions on the bottom -- but didn't end up eating them as they seemed to disappear... Definitely will make this again.  Thanks!
214855,73927,2007-06-29,5,"Wonderful recipe. I added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the mix, used tinned pie apples (no added sugar) and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top before baking. Delicious served with vanilla ice-cream. Thanks for such a simple but delicious recipe!"
472045,266248,2010-04-08,5,"These cookies are excellent, especially the filling. They are bite size combinations of shortbread cookies and lemon bars. The filing has such a great sweet lemon taste to it that it can be hard to resist. Thanks!"
195589,425865,2010-08-21,5,"I can see why this won a prize, it's delish! I love the citrus in the dressing, in fact, I doubled the dressing. I also added some finely chopped red onion and used red and yellow peppers as that is what I had in the garden that I needed to use up. Oh, also used regular fat feta, cuz that is what we like. : ) I could see making this with tuna instead of the chicken as well. A great summer dish, thanks for posting, WiGal."
306797,87085,2008-05-31,5,"Great recipe.  I followed fairly closely, adding zucchini & frozen corn, substituting green for red pepper.  Used a jar of pasta sauce & a small tin of diced tomatoes instead of the tomoto sauce.  Probably added a little extra seasoning too, but overall this was great.  Also reheated well for lunch the next day.  Thanks Kim for sharing this keeper."
298981,40082,2011-01-30,5,"This was delicious!  The only thing I would do different would be to lover the salt amount.  It seemed salty to us.  But we don't use too much salt normally so that might be why..... but very tasty, moist and easy!  Thanks again for sharing this recipe!"
13483,26668,2003-06-28,5,"Love portobello mushrooms!!  Only thing I changed was the basil to sage.  I have tons of sage growing all over the place and, somehow, I just cannot get basil to grow!!  Good thing I love sage and it goes just as well in this recipe.  Thanks Dancer^."
422893,328675,2008-12-15,4,"This made for a lovely filling brekky that both toddler DD & I enjoyed, so simple to do too which I loved. Thanks Pat!"
273527,27210,2008-11-16,5,"I prepeared a COSTCO package of chops on a Sunday and we cooked these all through the week. We found the longer the chops marinated, the better flavor the meat had. We aso tried baking it too- chops came out too soggy. Grilling is def the way to go."
2000306644,277468,2018-07-23,4,"Directions and descriptions were VERY helpful. This was my first time making this dish. I reduced the chiles consdierably, since my son only enjoys a tiny bit of heat. Definitely would want more if I was only making for myself. When I cooked the beans, I added a slice of bacon and a quarter yellow onion for more flavor. The bean/cheese proportions are way off, I halved the cheese mixture and still had twice as much cheese as I did beans. The masa mix made exactly 20 papusas. I had to add a lot more water to the masa to get it sticky enough, but the directions were descriptive enough that I knew what consistency I was looking for. Oh, and when I was cooking up the bean mixture, it took a little while for them to deepen in color and next time I would add some more cooking liquid towards the end if they get on the dry side. They were still amazing, though! I did not have the same difficulty as other reviewers shared when forming the balls around the filling - the dough (with the added water) was stretchy and did not crack. Occaisionally it broke open in some spots where it was thin, but I just smoothed it back closed again in those spots and it was no big deal. My papusas came out DELICIOUS and quire pretty, although next time I will add more salt. My 4 y/o said they are &quot;better than steak&quot;, haha! Made the slaw and salsa recommended, both were very good as-is and added lots of yummy flavor."
265711,19766,2007-02-24,4,I used all the flavouring ingredients except the miso as I didn't have any and also the food colouring I omitted too. I used my pork in chow mein and was a real hit with my DH and our friends when I made it last weekend. Thankyou for the inspiration!!!!
169430,162946,2008-07-28,4,"A delightful easy to make recipe that yields lovely muffins. I made Hazelnut Vanilla by using vanilla fat free yogurt, chopping some hazelnuts and adding them in and adding hazelnut extract along with the vanilla (1/2 a tsp of each for the 6 muffins I made). The sugar was replaced with Splenda, I lessened the butter to 1 1/2 Tbsp of a healthier fat margarine and making up the rest of the 1/4 cup with applesauce. For the 1/2 and 1/2 I used fat free coffee creamer. The muffins are light and fluffy and taste delicious."
41578,430242,2011-05-13,5,"DELICIOUS! We really enjoyed the marinade.  I had to used dried Rosemary and it still turned out great.  Can't wait to make it again with fresh Rosemary.  Thanks for sharing this winner, Scoutie."
696459,366166,2009-11-20,5,Took these on a weekend retreat this summer.  They were a hit.  Moist and Tasty.  I believe I only used 2 Tbls of the fake syrup.  I think 4 would have made them EXTREMELY sugary with the white chocolate.  We eat a lot of sugar free items in our household so adjust the white chocolate and syrup to your liking.  I now add syrup to my regular rice krispie treats for a little shot of sugary flavor.  Will be making again!
503676,211001,2009-03-01,5,excellent! served it on duck breasts and will try on steak too!
223854,176017,2007-03-06,4,"This was a very easy dish to make. The only thing different I did was I blended the sauce with a electric hand wand to combine the ingredients, then poured it in the chicken. I left it marinate over night, when I was ready to cook it I placed it in the oven uncovered, served it with steam rice. YUMMY!  Thank you Chef Potts"
226863,87748,2008-01-29,5,"I used low sodium soy sauce, and home-made chicken broth (which was low sodium), so I didn't have a problem with too much salt.  I had no sake, but used white wine instead.  The sauce still turned out wonderfully!  I thought this sauce was really tasty.  I'll try it again over a chicken stir fry...used it this time over a stir fry with crab.  I don't think this stir fry sauce works well with fish or shellfish!  My mistake...the sauce itself was great."
293042,32410,2008-04-20,2,This was fabulous.  I didn't have any ready to go pastry so I topped it with mashed potato and bread crumbs instead.  My husband nearly ate the whole thing!  This will definitely take a place in my permanent repetorire!  Thanks!
129958,161716,2007-04-06,5,"Delish!  Served this tonight to my neighbors and we all loved it.  I prepared it as directed, even using the Miracle Whip, even though the mayo lover in me was tempted to sub and use mayo!  I love frozen peas in a salad like this and the thousand island dressing gave it a little kick that was subtle but there.  This is a keeper!  Thanks Jacqueline in KY!"
11461,50875,2009-06-27,5,"We love spinach and blueberries, so we had to try this recipe.  It is our new favorite!!  Some time ago, a friend was telling me about a wonderful blueberry vinaigrette that she made, but she didn't remember what she did.  I've been on the lookout for such a recipe since then.  This is perfection.  I'm sure it would be good on any greens.  BUT, this mixture of cheese, nuts, blueberries, and spinach is fabulous.  And, I think you could take this to a potluck by just taking the salad ingredients separetely and mixing with the dressing (which is fine made up ahead of time) at the last minute.  I'm planning to take it to a potluck in late July.  Thank you for such a treat!"
1139501,30110,2010-05-01,3,I wasn't that fond of these. I don't know what the problem was. I do love cliantro so it couldn't have been it and I like all the other ingredients too.. I don't know... it didn't taste as good as it sounded...
2471817,21171,2012-10-28,0,"Love the recipe, we always use this one :D thanks  <br/>plus we put this in the bread machine comes out just as good."
936465,99476,2009-07-02,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.. it is extremely easy and the flavour is amazing...added more onion... as we enjoy very much... definately a keeper recipe.. thanks
89831,291797,2009-04-13,5,"I didn't make these but my DS's fiance did for her family for Easter, I am posting her 10-star rating and her thank you to you Sarah for such a great Easter recipe!"
632249,1982,2007-12-04,5,I am making gift baskets for Christmas and thought this would be a wonderful addition.  Great taste! Thx Carrie!
2000291000,525759,2016-05-25,5,"OMG... best.... cupcakes....EVER. The flavor is amazing. I just happened to have lavender flowers as I buy them from a tea company to use in baking. This was my first ever vegan cupcake recipe and I was afraid it wouldn't rise. Nope, these are nice and fluffy and moist. Seriously, I will never make regular cupcakes again. So yummy. My only complaint is that the recipe only made 10 cupcakes instead of 12. I am taking them to a surprise party tomorrow. My vegan friends are going to love them."
394953,67148,2007-12-18,5,These are so easy and SO delicious (and I don't even like butterscotch)!!! Everyone loves them. Thanks so much!
57222,254574,2013-03-24,4,"Made 1/2 recipe for one loaf pan and am happy with the results of this different &amp; quick mixing technique! :-) A lovely, soft cake - and I really like the chocolate dough that is flavoured with chocolate rather than cocoa powder! I&#039;m not sure if I mixed the dough too long or not long enough: it started to turn &quot;glue-y&quot; quite quickly and I decided to stop mixing!! Still, a great, tasty cake emeged from the oven, so no worries! Thank you for sharing!"
498271,18920,2011-02-15,4,Delightful way to serve fruit!  I loved the muscat with the melons and I think it would be great with other fruits as well.  I thought I had some mint but couldn't find it - I think that would have been a great addition too.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  Made for the Best of 2010 Event (recommended by Cookgirl)
90086,148116,2006-02-04,5,This is fantastic! 
169430,456847,2018-10-31,5,I made this lovely recipe for Sunday dinner and it was very well enjoyed by everyone (even the picky husband). Simple to put together and the pork came out nice and tender. There was no sauce left either. Served with some peas and carrots (from summers garden) and fresh biscuits. Thanks so much for another grand recipe. Made for Autumn Fever game 2018.
1545470,24978,2010-05-16,5,I love this bread. I have been making it for my household once a week for the past 4 weeks. It is excellent. I love that it doesn't have a lot of sugar and no dairy- yet it still turns out soft and chewy. I've been out of rolled oats and have substituted oat bran which has made it light and fluffy. EXCELLENT!
169969,171345,2007-02-09,5,I love this! We make these a lot on the weekends. I also like to heat the tortilla. Great recipe! Thanks for posting it!
275335,37120,2007-01-12,5,This is a lively way to do baby carrots.  Didn't use as much butter and didn't add additional sugar.  Delish!
736554,293493,2008-04-10,5,Great Snickerdoodle cookie!  My DH loved them.  I baked for 8 minutes.  They were crisp on the outside and soft in the middle.  Thanks QueenJellyBean.
262965,19912,2006-05-21,4,"Very nice.  Did 2 tenderloins at once, 45 min @ 425 and they were a tad over done (about 190 degrees).  I'll check a litte earlier next time.  Tripled the sauce recipe, an was still a little short.  Family enjoyed it, so will make again.  Thanks for sharing."
234062,52713,2007-04-01,5,"Wow! What a dish! Simple to make, and an absolutely astounding mix of flavours! So delicious, I'll be making it again and again! Especially since the ""bowls"" can be premade! The flavour is hard to describe, but all I can say is it is well worth making! We didn't even have it with ice cream as it was rich and just so flavourful!"
168087,21533,2005-09-03,5,"Wow, these are pretty good muffins, i only use 1/2 c sugar (the sweetness turned out just right),1/4craisins (i don't like too much raisins) and omit the apricolts.   I just love the ""bran"" texture.  Thanks Uncle Bill!!"
895056,50600,2013-02-28,5,"So good and sooo easy.  After making it several times with regular caraway seeds, I searched out the nigella sativa seeds (labeled as Charnushka in my spice shop - look in an Indian grocery).  My husband and I prefer the plain old caraway seeds.  The nigella sativa seeds gave it the flavor of how pencil shaving smell.  Not a bad taste, just not our preference.  The dough has never been dry enough that I can knead it.  Just stir well and dump the sticky glob into your cast iron.  It will still set up beautifully."
359553,119444,2007-05-07,5,"This was a very good dish!  My husband wasn't too sure when he peeked into the crock before I added the cheese, but after the cheese was added it turned into a delish, creamy side dish!  I think next time I make this I will serve it over brown rice for a great vegetarian meal!  Thanks for posting the recipe.  I will definately be making this again soon."
160974,21284,2005-08-09,5,"Thanks to Pumpkie's great photo I'd been anxious to try this. I used low fat sour cream and increased the filling amount slightly. I might have overbaked it slightly (was out jogging), since it crumbled slightly around edges when cut. My husband has really been enjoying this with his morning cup of tea. I was thrilled to see my wavy cinnamon line throughout the loaf, just like the photo! I used a sharp butcher knife to swirl the batter.
Roxygirl"
39835,61463,2003-11-27,5,Excellent rolls which are very easy to make. Made the dough (starter) the night before so it was ready to be made into rolls in the morning. Thanks Heather -- this is a definite keeper.
401688,56323,2009-04-23,5,"This was an outstanding lobster recipe.  The only thing I did different was my basil and thyme were fresh so I chopped them and added to the garlic butter.  I took Travis's suggestion and put the leftover butter in the shell. After the lobster was done, I poured the remaining butter on top of the lobsters.  My husband thought it was the best lobster he had ever eaten -having spent many years catching and cooking lobster in the Keys -that is a  mighty fine approval."
857580,193126,2010-05-23,5,"It really am amazed that people can taste something and recreate it like this. It was pretty spot-on as far as Japanese steak house salad dressings go. I only had red miso, and it turned out fine."
2005554,376801,2018-01-04,0,raichlen's mustard coleslaw
58038,75756,2005-04-12,5,Great flavor and an easy recipe.  DS and I made cut-out cookies with these and he had a grand time rolling the dough and using the cookie cutters.  I had to use non-dairy margarine instead of butter due to a dairy allergy in DS's class and it worked fine.  I think we will be making these a lot.
681843,191225,2008-02-01,4,"These Cookies Were Great!  The one thing I did change was the shortening, I use butter flavored shortening, because usually I like to use butter, and the flavor was fantastic! They were fairly easy to make as well which is a bonus with three little one running around!! Thanks April!"
358796,160987,2007-03-07,4,Good stuff! Dresses up boring canned tuna and sneaks in a lot of veggies. Loved the artichokes & spinach. The thyme makes it taste fresh (we only used 1 tablespoon and it was plenty).
58950,23812,2002-10-27,4,"They were great, but I didn't exactly like the texture of how they came out. Great for when you need something familiar."
252514,326435,2008-10-03,5,"I love Mark Bittman's recipes, never too complex but they always taste great. This one is no exception. I used 4 cups of well-packed zucchini which seemed about right. I also added 4 bouillon cubes for flavor. This soup is primarily a zucchini chowder, but there is a semblance to egg flower soup as well, from the addition of egg and lemon. Yum! This will be a great way to use up frozen grated zucchini in the middle of winter.  Thanks blucoat!"
173314,148921,2006-02-01,5,"Delicious and brings back fond memories as they aren't around Buffalo, NY anymore.  THANKYOU for such quality recipe!!!!!"
303802,106757,2007-10-24,5,"I thought this was outstanding. Family loved it too. My husband is not much on chicken, but stated he thought this chicken was very good. I fixed this last night and my son requested it again tonight. I guess I'll have to double the recipe next time. Thanks!"
215898,123522,2006-08-08,5,Delicious! Absolutely wonderful!  The marinade would be terrific by itself - the bacon and cheese just put it over the top!
564083,22176,2007-08-22,5,This was FAB! We had it 2 nights ago and we all loved it. Not hard to prepare and what a treat.  I just found this web site and boy am I glad I did.  This brings new life to our meal time. Thanks
53959,195945,2007-10-13,5,This was delicious. I made it in my toaster oven as my oven was cooking a ham but other then that followed the directions exactly. thank you
2383576,149088,2013-09-12,5,"I promise I do have every intention of trying this as written but I have used it to make my now-famous butternut squash lasagna. I use a pound of sweet Italian turkey sausage with the casings removed, a (thawed) 10-oz package of frozen butternut squash instead of the diced tomatoes, and a whole jar of Dave&#039;s Gourmet Butternut Squash pasta sauce instead of tomato based sauce. I use an entire tub of ricotta and whole-wheat lasagna noodles. Oh my gods - best lasagna I have ever had. I imagine as written it&#039;s also amazing, and I do intend to try it that way. Thank you so much for providing this recipe for me to use as a base - you have turned me from a novice lasagna-maker to a celebrity (just within my family, but still)!"
1174852,94259,2009-02-18,4,"I made the 2 round cakes but was a little disappointed with the moisture. I agree to with un petit chou, it was not wet enough. I made it for work and it was highly praised though, hence the 4 star rating. I topped with fresh whipped cream and a swirl of dark chocolate syrup."
422893,176624,2007-12-21,4,"I was given a huge bag of spinach leaves by a grower & my basil wasn't quite ready yet so this pesto recipe was a great find. Tastes very yummy. I forgot to drizzle some olive oil over the top & mine got a pink coating after about 10 days which scared me so I ended up tossing the rest of it out, sigh! To future reviewers, don't forget the olive oil coating!!!!!"
